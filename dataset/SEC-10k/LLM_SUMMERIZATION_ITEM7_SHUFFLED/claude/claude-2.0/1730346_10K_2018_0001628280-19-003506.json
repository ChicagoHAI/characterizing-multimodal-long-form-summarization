Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d reflecting our current expectations, estimates, and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes, and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere herein. Please read Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Also, please read the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere herein. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nCharah Solutions, Inc.\nCharah Solutions was formed in January 2018 and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the transactions described under -Initial Public Offering.\u201d In connection with the closing of our initial public offering (the IPO\u201d), and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the master reorganization agreement, dated June 13, 2018, Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Allied Power Holdings\u201d), became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nThrough our ownership of Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, we own the outstanding equity interests in Charah and Allied, the subsidiaries through which we operate our businesses.\nOverview\nWe were formed in January 2018 in anticipation of the IPO to be a holding company for Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings. The historical financial data presented herein as of December 31, 2018 and for periods after the June 18, 2018 corporate reorganization is that of Charah and Allied on a consolidated basis, and on a combined basis for periods prior to the June 18, 2018 corporate reorganization. Allied was formed in May 2017 and did not commence operations until July 2017.\nWe are a leading provider of mission-critical environmental and maintenance services to the power generation industry, enabling our customers to address challenges related to the remediation of ash ponds and landfills at open and closed power plant sites while continuously operating and providing necessary electric power to communities nationwide. We offer a suite of coal ash management and recycling, environmental remediation, and outage maintenance services. We also design and implement solutions for complex environmental projects (such as coal ash pond closures) and facilitate coal ash recycling through byproduct sales and other beneficial use services. We operate in over 20 states, resulting in an overall footprint and density in key markets that we believe is difficult to replicate.\nWe are an environmental remediation and maintenance company and conduct our operations through two segments: Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services.\nEnvironmental Solutions. Our Environmental Solutions segment includes remediation and compliance services, as well as byproduct sales offerings. Remediation and compliance services are associated with our customers' need for multi-year environmental improvement and sustainability initiatives, whether driven by proactive engagement, by power generation customers, by regulatory requirements, or by consumer expectations and standards. Byproduct sales support both our power generation customers' desire to profitably recycle recurring and historic volumes of CCRs and our ultimate end customers' need for high-quality, cost-effective raw material substitutes.\nMaintenance and Technical Services. Our Maintenance and Technical Services segment includes fossil services and, from and after May 2017 when Allied was created, nuclear services. Fossil services are the recurring and mission-critical management of coal ash and the routine maintenance, outage services and staffing solutions for coal-fired power generation facilities. Nuclear services, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, include routine maintenance, outage services, facility maintenance, and staffing solutions for nuclear power generation facilities. The Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are most closely associated with the ongoing operations of power plants, whether in the form of daily environmental management or required maintenance services (typically during planned outages).\nInitial Public Offering\nOn June 18, 2018, we completed the IPO of 7,352,941 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The net proceeds of the IPO to us prior to offering expenses were approximately $59.2 million. We used a portion of the IPO proceeds to pay off approximately $40.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan, and any remaining net proceeds were used to pay offering expenses or for general corporate purposes.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\nWe use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our operations, including:\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Revenues;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross Profit;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating Income;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA Margin.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Revenues\nWe analyze our revenues by comparing actual revenues to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods to assess our performance. We believe that revenues are a meaningful indicator of the demand and pricing for our services.\nGross Profit\nWe analyze our gross profit, which we define as revenues less cost of sales, to measure our financial performance. We believe gross profit is a meaningful metric because it provides insight on financial performance of our revenue streams without consideration of Company overhead. When analyzing gross profit, we compare actual gross profit to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods to assess our performance.\nOperating Income\nWe analyze our operating income, which we define as revenues less cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, to measure our financial performance. We believe operating income is a meaningful metric because it provides insight on profitability and operating performance based on the cost basis of our assets. We also compare operating income to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as an important indicator of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, and income taxes, elimination of certain legacy expenses, amounts from a non-acquired business line, and transaction related expenses and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues. See -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nAbility to Capture New Contracts and Opportunities\nOur ability to grow revenue and earnings is dependent on maintaining and increasing our market share, renewing existing contracts, and obtaining additional contracts from proactive bidding on contracts with new and existing customers. We proactively work with existing customers ahead of contract end dates to attempt to secure contract renewals. We also leverage the embedded long-term nature of our customer relationships to obtain insight into and to capture new business opportunities across our platform.\nSeasonality of Business\nBased on historic trends, we expect our operating results to vary seasonally. Nuclear power generators perform turnaround and outages in the off-peak months when demand is lower and generation capacity is less constrained. As a result, our nuclear services offerings may have higher revenue volume in the spring and fall months. Variations in normal weather patterns can also cause changes in the consumption of energy, which may influence demand and timing of associated services for our fossil services offerings. Inclement weather can impact construction-related activities associated with pond and landfill remediation, which affects the timing of revenue generation within remediation and compliance services. Byproduct sales are also impacted during winter months when the utilization of cement and cement products is generally lower.\nProject-Based Nature of Environmental Remediation Mandates\nWe believe there is a significant pipeline of coal ash ponds and landfills that will require remediation and/or closure in the future. Due to their scale and complexity, these environmental remediation projects are typically completed over longer periods of time. As a result, our revenues from these projects can fluctuate over time. Some of our revenues from projects are recognized using percentage of completion accounting for GAAP purposes. This method of revenue recognition is determined by estimating the percentage of completion on a project and the ultimate estimated gross profit margin on the project. The timing of revenues\nrecorded for financial reporting purposes may differ from actual billings to customers, sometimes resulting in costs and billing in excess of actual revenues. Because of the risks in estimating long-term projects, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nByproduct Recycling Market Dynamics\nThere is a growing demand for recycled coal ash across a variety of applications, in addition to the market forces and governmental regulations driving the need to dispose of coal ash in an environmentally sensitive manner. Pricing of byproduct sales is driven by supply and demand market dynamics, in addition to the chemical and physical properties of the ash. As demand increases for the end products that use recycled coal-fired power generation waste byproducts (i.e., concrete for construction and infrastructure projects), the demand for recycled coal ash also typically rises. These fluctuations affect the relative demand for our byproduct sales offerings. In recessionary periods, construction and infrastructure spending and the corresponding need for concrete may decline. However, this unfavorable effect may be partially offset by an increase in the demand for recycled coal ash during a recessionary period given coal ash is more cost-effective than other alternatives.\nPower Generation Industry Spend on Environmental Liability Management and Regulatory Requirements\nThe power generation industry has increased annual spending on environmental liability management. We believe this is the result of not only regulatory and consumer pressure, but also the industry's increasing focus on environmental stewardship. Continued increases in spending on environmental liability management by our customers should result in increased demand for services across our platform.\nCost Management and Capital Investment Efficiency\nOur main operating costs consist of labor and material costs and equipment maintenance. We maintain a focus on cost management and efficiency, including monitoring labor costs, both in terms of wage rates and headcount, along with other costs such as materials and equipment. We maintain a disciplined approach to capital expenditure decisions, which are typically associated with specific contract requirements. Furthermore, we strive to extend the useful life of our equipment through the application of a well-planned routine maintenance program.\nHow We Generate Revenues\nThe Environmental Solutions segment generates revenue through our remediation and compliance services, as well as byproduct sales offerings. Our remediation and compliance services offerings primarily consist of designing, constructing, managing, remediating, and closing ash ponds and landfills on customer-owned sites. Our byproduct sales offerings include the recycling of recurring and contracted volumes of coal-fired power generation waste byproducts, such as bottom ash, fly ash, and gypsum byproduct, each of which can be used for various industrial purposes. Our platform of services is contracted for terms generally ranging from 18 months to five years, thereby reducing financial volatility. In excess of 90% of our services work is structured as time and materials, cost reimbursable, or unit price contracts, which significantly reduces the risk of loss on contracts and provides gross margin visibility. Revenue from management contracts is recognized when the ash is hauled to the landfill or the management services are provided. Revenue from the sales of ash is recognized when it is delivered to the customer.\nThe Maintenance and Technical Services segment generates revenue through our fossil services and nuclear services offerings. Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are most closely associated with the ongoing operations of power plants, whether in the form of daily environmental management or required maintenance services (typically during planned outages). Our fossil services offerings focus on recurring and mission-critical management of coal ash and routine maintenance, outage services and staffing solutions for coal-fired power generation facilities to fulfill an environmental service need of our customers in handling their waste byproducts. Our nuclear services operations, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, consists of a broad platform of mission-critical professional, technical, and craft services spanning the entire asset life cycle of a nuclear power generator. The services are performed on the customer's site and the contract terms typically range from three to five years. Revenues are billed and paid during the periods of time work is being executed. Our nuclear services revenues tend to be seasonal and may experience significant increases during periods of shutdowns of generators. This combination of the maintenance and environmental-related services deepens customer connectivity and drives long-term relationships which we believe is critical for renewing existing contracts, winning incremental business from existing customers at new sites, and adding new customers. Over the last five years, we have achieved an approximately 90% renewal rate for contracts in our fossil services offerings up for renewal.\nFactors Impacting the Comparability of Results of Operations\nPublic Company Costs\nAs a new public company, we expect to incur incremental recurring and certain non-recurring costs related to our transition to a publicly traded and taxable corporation, including the costs of the IPO and the costs associated with the initial implementation of our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 internal control implementation and testing. We also expect to incur additional significant and recurring expenses as a publicly traded company, including costs associated with the employment of additional personnel,\ncompliance under the Exchange Act, annual and quarterly reports to common stockholders, registrar and transfer agent fees, national stock exchange fees, audit fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs, and director and officer compensation.\nIncome Taxes\nCharah Solutions is a C\u201d Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and, as a result, is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes. In connection with the IPO, Charah and Allied, which previously were flow-through entities for income tax purposes and were indirect subsidiaries of two partnerships, Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, respectively, became indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Prior to the contribution, Charah and Allied passed through their taxable income to the owners of the partnerships for U.S. federal and other state and local income tax purposes and, thus, were not subject to U.S. federal income taxes or other state or local income taxes, except for franchise tax at the state level (at less than 1% of modified pre-tax earnings). Accordingly, the financial data attributable to Charah and Allied prior to the contribution on June 18, 2018 contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality other than franchise taxes.\nOperations of Allied Power Management, LLC\nAllied was formed in May 2017 and commenced operations in July 2017. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect the results of Allied only from the commencement of its operations in July 2017. As a result, our historical financial and operating information for the year ended December 31, 2018 may not be comparable to the historical financial and operating information for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below sets forth our selected operating data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein. The dollar amount and percentage change information below reflects the difference between results in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the combined results for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017 and the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

We continued to grow our operations with increased work in the nuclear power maintenance industry and improved our byproduct sales offerings with the acquisition of SCB in March 2018. Additionally, we resolved a significant legal matter that existed prior to the IPO. Additional information regarding the results of operations follows below.\nRevenues. Revenues increased $310.1 million, or 72.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $740.5 million as compared to $430.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues by segment was as follows:\nEnvironmental Solutions Revenues. Environmental Solutions segment revenues increased $103.1 million, or 42.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $343.1 million as compared to $240.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $45.8 million of revenue associated with the addition of SCB that occurred in March 2018, in addition to a net overall increase in revenue from our remediation and compliance services offerings.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Revenues. Maintenance and Technical Services segment revenues increased $207.0 million, or 108.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $397.4 million as compared to $190.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, which did not have a full year of operations in 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $13.6 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $97.7 million as compared to $84.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit was 13.2% and 19.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross profit by segment was as follows:\nEnvironmental Solutions Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Environmental Solutions segment increased $3.6 million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $69.5 million as compared to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the early completion of the Brickhaven ash remediation contract, which accelerated revenues and expenses related to this contract into 2018 and had a net positive impact on gross profit for the year. Under the terms of the Brickhaven contract, we expect to receive a significant cash payment from our customer in 2019, subject to the customer's final confirmation of the contract's early completion pursuant to the terms of the contract. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included $5.4 million attributable to the addition of SCB.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Maintenance and Technical Services segment increased $9.9 million, or 54.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $28.3 million as compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, which did not have a full year of operations in 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $25.1 million, or 48.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $76.8 million as compared to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to additional general and administrative expenses associated with our nuclear services offerings, including some non-recurring legal costs and accruals, as disclosed in our Adjusted EBITDA calculation included herein, in addition to increased expenses due to the addition of SCB.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net increased $13.9 million, or 75.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $32.2 million as compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $12.5 million of costs incurred in conjunction with the refinance of our debt, consisting of a $10.4 million write-off of non-cash debt issuance costs and a $2.1 million prepayment penalty, in addition to an increase in our debt balances. We incurred $4.1 million of costs associated with debt retirement in conjunction with BCP's investment in us, which was recorded during the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017.\nIncome from Equity Method Investment. Income from equity method investment increased $1.5 million, or 178.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.4 million as compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a price increase of the products sold through this joint venture and an increase in ash volumes generated by the utility and available for sale by us.\nNet Income (Loss). Net income decreased $21.4 million, or 142.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $(6.4) million as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in general and administrative expenses and interest expense, net, as disclosed above, offset by an income tax benefit of $2.4 million and increases in revenues and gross profit as disclosed above.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased $22.8 million, or 29.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $98.8 million as compared to $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 13.3%, a decrease of 4.3% from 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the gross profit increase described above and the early completion of the Brickhaven contract.\nFor a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nImpact of Brickhaven Accelerated Depreciation. As noted above, the accelerated completion of the Brickhaven ash remediation contract was an important factor in our third and fourth quarter 2018 results. Brickhaven is very different from our other remediation projects because we purchased, developed and permitted the site several years ago, requiring significant capital investment by us. We did this in conjunction with a contract under which our customer would supply ash that we would store at the Brickhaven site and an adjacent mine owned by us, and we would be reimbursed for our costs, including a return, on a per-ton basis. Riverbend is a retired power plant that is one of two from which we sourced ash but the contract contemplated follow-on sites, aggregating to approximately 20 million tons of ash that would be supplied to these mines. Due to a change in North Carolina law, the customer determined that it would not supply ash to these mines once Riverbend was completed. Under the terms of the contract, we expect to receive a significant payment from the customer for unrecovered project development costs and expected site closing costs. The early completion of the Brickhaven contract affected our 2018 results in two significant ways:\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>First, under percentage of completion accounting, we accelerated revenues and expenses (including depreciation and amortization) related to this project from 2019 into the third and fourth quarters of 2018. This had a net benefit\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nto gross profit but the benefit to Adjusted EBITDA was significantly greater because of the capital-intensive nature of the Brickhaven asset and the acceleration of depreciation. Of the $49 million of depreciation expense related to property, plant, and equipment we recorded in 2018, approximately $38 million was for Brickhaven and related equipment. Had we not had an early completion of the project, depreciation would have been significantly less. We also recorded $15 million of amortization of a purchase option liability related to Brickhaven, which reduced general and administrative expenses. Net of this negative amortization, total depreciation and amortization associated with Brickhaven was $23 million. Because the Riverbend project was completed in March 2019, the amount of revenues and depreciation associated with Brickhaven in 2019 will be substantially lower. Going forward, we expect that cost of goods sold will be more closely aligned with cash costs, consistent with the less capital-intensive nature that is typical of most of our remediation projects.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Second, we had an increase of unbilled costs on our balance sheet, shown as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, or CIE, which reduced operating cash flow by $79 million and thereby resulted in cash flow used in operations of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As we expect to substantially recover this amount in 2019, these working capital balances will reverse and generate significant cash flow.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe table below sets forth our selected operating data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

Revenues increased $165.3 million, or 62.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $430.4 million as compared to $265.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues by segment was as follows:\nEnvironmental Solutions Revenues. Environmental Solutions segment revenues increased $22.0 million, or 10.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $240.0 million as compared to $218.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our remediation and compliance services offerings in the amount of $26.3 million, partially offset by a reduction in revenues related to our non-acquired business line of $5.0 million.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Revenues. Maintenance and Technical Services segment revenues increased $143.3 million, or 304.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $190.3 million as compared to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings in the amount of $136.2 million, in addition to the net increase in revenues on fossil services projects of $7.1 million.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $22.3 million, or 36.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $84.2 million as compared to $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit was 19.6% and 23.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in gross profit by segment was as follows:\nEnvironmental Solutions Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Environmental Solutions segment increased $14.6 million, or 28.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $65.8 million as compared to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit from our remediation and compliance services and\nbyproduct sales offerings in the amount of $12.4 million and the elimination of negative gross profit associated with our non-acquired business line of $2.4 million.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Maintenance and Technical Services segment increased $7.8 million, or 73.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $18.3 million as compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, in addition to the net increase in gross profit on fossil services projects.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $16.5 million, or 46.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $51.7 million as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to $18.9 million of additional expenses associated with our nuclear services offerings, including $14.8 million of non-recurring and non-operating legal costs (including legal costs associated with outstanding litigation as disclosed in Note 18 to our audited financial statements included herein) and non-recurring startup costs, as disclosed in our Adjusted EBITDA calculation included herein.\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increased $12.1 million, or 193.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $18.3 million as compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We incurred $4.1 million of costs associated with debt retirement in conjunction with BCP's investment, which was recorded during the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017. During the period from January 13, 2017 to December 31, 2017, $6.1 million of non-cash debt issuance costs were expensed primarily due to the refinancing of our debt in October 2017. Additionally, we had higher interest costs associated with the increase in our debt balances in 2017.\nIncome from Equity Method Investment. Income from equity method investment decreased $1.8 million, or 68.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $0.9 million as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in ash volumes generated by the utility and available for sale by us.\nNet Income (Loss). Net income decreased $8.1 million, or 35.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $15.0 million as compared to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in general and administrative expenses noted above, along with an increase in interest expense, net, offset by increases in revenues and gross profit associated with our projects, including the addition of our nuclear services offerings.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.0 million, or 28.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $76.0 million as compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 17.7%, a decrease of 5.0% from 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFor a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nOur capital spending consists primarily of equipment costs associated with performance and completion of our contracts, including the replacement of dated and obsolete equipment, and the rollout of technology units that were acquired as part of our acquisition of SCB. However, the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer or increase a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, additional contracts awarded above and beyond our projections, and/or the increase or decrease in the useful life of our equipment. As we pursue growth, we monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities, and liquidity requirements. Based upon the current industry outlook, we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the ability to maintain existing contracts, to obtain new contracts, and to manage our operating expenses. The failure to achieve anticipated revenue and cash flows from operations could result in a reduction in future capital spending. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event we make additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures or to seek additional capital. We cannot assure you that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of approximately $50 million, comprised of $6.9 million of cash on hand, $18 million availability under the Revolving Loan and $25 million of delayed draw availability under the Term Loan.\nCash Flows\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below sets forth our cash flows for the years indicated.

The change in cash flows used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $21.4 million decrease in net income as explained above, a $73.0 million decrease in cash resulting from the increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings primarily related to Brickhaven, a $30.4 million decrease in cash resulting from the decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and an $8.4 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $23.3 million, an increase in asset retirement obligation of $24.8 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $10.8 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $8.0 million.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $33.1 million, or 455.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $40.4 million from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the $20.0 million used in 2018 for business acquisitions, net of cash received, and an increase in cash purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $43.5 million, or 293.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $28.6 million from $(14.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the $59.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, which was used to make $40.0 million of principal payments towards our term loan and also pay $8.9 million of costs associated with the IPO. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was also impacted by the refinancing of debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017, the acquisition of Charah by BCP in the first quarter of 2017, and a reduction in distributions to members in 2018.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe table below sets forth our cash flows for the years indicated. The successor column below represents the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and the predecessor columns below represent the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017 and the year ended December 31, 2016, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Period from\nJanuary 13, 2017\nthrough\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from\nJanuary 1, 2017\nthrough\nJanuary 12, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,418\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,351\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>539.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,270\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15,885\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19,304\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(236\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,325.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $45.0 million, or 539.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $53.4 million from $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in net change in working capital of $41.0 million and other items.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $8.6 million, or 54.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.3 million from $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the elimination of a restricted cash requirement associated with one of our projects, an increase in purchases of property and equipment, net of sales, and other investing cash outflows in 2016 that did not recur in 2017.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $22.1 million, or 303.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $(14.8) million from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable to net proceeds from loan financings of $114.0 million and capital contributions of $10.0 million, offset by distributions to members of $136.0 million.\nWorking Capital\nOur working capital, which we define as total current assets less total current liabilities, totaled $74.1 million and $12.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of a $78.8 million increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, a $24.1 million increase in inventory, a $14.5 million decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and a $13.5 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by a $25.4 million decrease in cash, a $25.0 million increase in asset retirement obligation, a $14.5 million increase in accrued expenses, a $9.6 million increase in accounts payable, and a $5.1 million increase in purchase option liability.\nOur Debt Agreements\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn October 25, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent. The Revolving Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), with a principal amount of up to $45.0 million. The Credit Facility permitted extensions of credit up to the lesser of $45.0 million and a borrowing base that was calculated by us based upon a percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory, and approved by the administrative agent.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Credit Facility were based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at our election, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus a 2.00% borrowing margin, or (ii) an alternative base rate plus a 1.00% borrowing margin. Customary fees were payable in respect of the Credit\nFacility and included (i) commitment fees in an amount equal to 0.50% of the daily unused portions of the Credit Facility, and (ii) a 2.00% fee on outstanding letters of credit.\nThe Credit Facility contained various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants. If excess availability under the Credit Facility fell below the greater of 15% of the loan cap amount or $6.75 million, we were required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. The Credit Facility did not otherwise contain financial maintenance covenants.\nThe Credit Facility had a scheduled maturity date of October 25, 2022; however, all amounts outstanding were repaid in September 2018 as a result of the refinancing discussed below.\nTerm Loan\nOn October 25, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent, providing for a term loan (the CS Term Loan\u201d) with an initial commitment of $250.0 million. The CS Term Loan provided that we had the right at any time to request incremental term loans up to the greater of (i) the excess, if any, of $25.0 million over the aggregate amount of all incremental Credit Facility commitments and incremental term loan commitments previously utilized, and (ii) such other amount so long as such amount at such time could be incurred without causing the pro forma consolidated secured leverage ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1.00.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the CS Term Loan were based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at our election, either (i) LIBOR plus a 6.25% borrowing margin, or (ii) an alternative base rate plus a 5.25% borrowing margin.\nThe CS Term Loan contained various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants. In addition, we were required to comply with a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1.00 beginning March 31, 2018, decreasing to 4.50 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2019, and further decreasing to 4.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2020 and thereafter.\nThe principal amount of the CS Term Loan amortized at a rate of 7.5% per annum with all remaining outstanding amounts under the CS Term Loan due on the CS Term Loan maturity date. We received net proceeds from the IPO of $59.2 million prior to deducting offering expenses. We used these net proceeds to pay offering expenses and to pay off $40.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under the CS Term Loan, which would otherwise have been required through June 2020.\nThe CS Term Loan had a maturity date of October 25, 2024; however, all amounts outstanding were repaid in September 2018 as a result of the refinancing discussed above.\nOn September 21, 2018, we entered into the Syndicated Credit Facility, providing for a Term Loan with an initial commitment of $205.0 million. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay amounts outstanding under the CS Term Loan. As of December 31, 2018, we had $202.4 million outstanding under the Term Loan.\nSyndicated Credit Facility\nOn September 21, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the Syndicated Credit Facility\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Syndicated Credit Facility includes:\n\u2022A revolving loan not to exceed $50.0 million (the Revolving Loan\u201d);\n\u2022A term loan of $205.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d); and\n\u2022A commitment to loan up to a further $25.0 million, which expires in March 2020.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Syndicated Credit Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at our election, either (i) the LIBOR rate, or (ii) an alternative base rate. Various margins are added to the interest rate based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio. Customary fees are payable in respect of the Syndicated Credit Facility and include (i) commitment fees (ranging from 0.25% to 0.35% based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio) for unused portions of the Syndicated Credit Facility, and (ii) fees on outstanding letters of credit (ranging from 1.30% to 2.10% based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio). Amounts borrowed under the Syndicated Credit Facility are secured by essentially all assets of the Company.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility contains various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to specified exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to grant liens, incur indebtedness (including guarantees), make investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, make dispositions of assets, make restricted payments, or change the nature of our or our subsidiaries' business. The Syndicated Credit Facility contains financial covenants related to the consolidated net leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio (of 1.20 to 1.00). We are required to comply with a consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.00 through March 30, 2020, decreasing to 3.50 to 1.00 as of March 31,\n2020, further decreasing to 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2021, and finally decreasing to 3.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2022 and thereafter.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility also contains certain affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements (such as delivery of financial statements, certificates, and notices of certain events), maintaining insurance, and providing additional guarantees and collateral in certain circumstances.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Syndicated Credit Facility.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility includes customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross default to certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments, and change of control.\nThe Revolving Loan provides a principal amount of up to $50.0 million reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, $19.8 million was outstanding on the Revolving Loan and $12.5 million of letters of credit were outstanding.\nEquipment Financing Facilities\nWe have entered into various equipment financing arrangements to finance the acquisition of certain equipment (the Equipment Financing Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had equipment lines of credit allowing borrowings of $22.0 million, of which $17.9 million was utilized. In addition, we had $17.2 million of equipment notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Each of the Equipment Financing Facilities include non-financial covenants, and, as of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018: Table 82: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loan\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revolving Loan\n</td> <td>19,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment Financing Facilities\n</td> <td>35,104\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,539\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Outstanding Loans\n</td> <td>50,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,447\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,309\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations(1)\n</td> <td>11,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,066\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>179,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We lease equipment and office facilities under non-cancellable operating leases.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Uncertain tax positions, the purchase option liability, contingent payments for acquisitions, and the asset retirement obligation are not included in the table above because timing of such payments is uncertain.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, elimination of certain legacy expenses, amounts from a non-acquired business line, non-recurring legal and startup costs, and transaction related expenses and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues (which for the year ended December 31, 2016 was less revenues ($5,045) of a non-acquired business line).\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful performance measures because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts are either non-recurring or can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA\nare significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure the success for our business in managing our cost base and improving profitability. The following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with our Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nThe successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Successor\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Predecessor\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Period from\nJanuary 1, 2017\nthrough January 12, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income attributable to Charah Solutions, Inc.\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,902\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>32,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,181\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(2,427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>42,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of certain non-recurring legal costs and expenses(1)\n</td> <td>25,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of certain non-recurring startup costs(2)\n</td> <td>1,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity-based compensation\n</td> <td>4,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Elimination of legacy expenses(3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-acquired business line(4)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction related expenses and other items\n</td> <td>4,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(422\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,965\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA margin(5)\n</td> <td>13.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.7%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Represents non-recurring legal costs and expenses, which amounts are not representative of those that we historically incur in the ordinary course of our business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Represents non-recurring startup costs associated with the startup of Allied and our nuclear services offerings, including the setup of financial operations systems and modules, pre-contract expenses to obtain initial contracts, and the hiring of operational staff.

In connection with preparing our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nassets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our consolidated combined financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in our audited historical consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein. We believe that the Company's primary critical accounting policy is its policy regarding accounting for long-term contracts. This policy is the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition on Construction Contracts\nAccounting for construction contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenues and costs. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, and asset utilization. We have a process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information, including any outstanding key contract matters, progress toward completion and the related project timeline, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. In 2018, we had an accrual of $0.7 million for anticipated losses on long-term contracts.\nRevenues from contract claims are recognized when invoiced. Revenues from contract change orders are recognized when it is probable that the change order will be approved, the amount can be reasonably estimated, and the work has been completed.\nThe asset, Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts. The liability, Billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings\u201d represents billings in excess of revenues recognized.\nAsset Acquisition and Business Combinations\nOn January 13, 2017, Charah Management completed a transaction with BCP, a previously unrelated third party. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. By the application of push-down\u201d accounting, Charah's assets, liabilities and equity were accordingly adjusted to fair value. The fair value estimates used reflect our best estimates for the highest and best use by market participants.\nOn March 31, 2018, Charah Management completed a transaction with SCB and affiliated entities, a previously unrelated third party, pursuant to which Charah acquired certain assets and liabilities of SCB. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. For more information on the business combination, see Note 2 to our consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nDetermining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices, and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the consolidated and combined financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the cost of an acquisition purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets, and such amounts are reported separately as goodwill on our consolidated and combined balance sheets. Our total goodwill resulted from the application of push-down\u201d accounting associated with BCP's January 2017 acquisition of a controlling equity position in Charah Management and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of SCB.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually, as of October 1st of each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment is not performed, or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then the reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach based on discounted cash flows. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows, and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units' expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units' earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value.\nThe Company performed quantitative assessments of its Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services reporting units as of October 1, 2018. The Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services reporting units' fair values, as calculated, were approximately 7.0% and 130.1%, respectively, greater than their book values as of October 1, 2018.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our historical consolidated and combined financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, included elsewhere herein, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company,\u201d which allows us to have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act.

The increase was primarily attributable to a price increase of the products sold through this joint venture and an increase in ash volumes generated by the utility and available for sale by us.\nFactors Impacting the Comparability of Results of Operations\nEquipment Financing Facilities\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased $22.8 million, or 29.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $98.8 million as compared to $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 13.3%, a decrease of 4.3% from 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the gross profit increase described above and the early completion of the Brickhaven contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nInitial Public Offering\nThe Credit Facility had a scheduled maturity date of October 25, 2022; however, all amounts outstanding were repaid in September 2018 as a result of the refinancing discussed below.\nThe table below sets forth our cash flows for the years indicated. The successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThe asset, Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts.

Gross profit for our Environmental Solutions segment increased $14.6 million, or 28.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $65.8 million as compared to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit from our remediation and compliance services and\nFinancing Activities\nMaintenance and Technical Services Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Maintenance and Technical Services segment increased $7.8 million, or 73.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $18.3 million as compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, in addition to the net increase in gross profit on fossil services projects.\nCharah Solutions was formed in January 2018 and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the transactions described under -Initial Public Offering.\u201d In connection with the closing of our initial public offering (the IPO\u201d), and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the master reorganization agreement, dated June 13, 2018, Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Allied Power Holdings\u201d), became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in our audited historical consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein. We believe that the Company's primary critical accounting policy is its policy regarding accounting for long-term contracts. This policy is the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\n (4) Non-acquired business line item adjusts for a legacy operation of Charah that was transferred to a stockholder of CEP Holdings, Inc. in January 2017 prior to the BCP investment. \nOur main operating costs consist of labor and material costs and equipment maintenance. We maintain a focus on cost management and efficiency, including monitoring labor costs, both in terms of wage rates and headcount, along with other costs such as materials and equipment. We maintain a disciplined approach to capital expenditure decisions, which are typically associated with specific contract requirements. Furthermore, we strive to extend the useful life of our equipment through the application of a well-planned routine maintenance program.\nAccounting for construction contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenues and costs. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, and asset utilization. We have a process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information, including any outstanding key contract matters, progress toward completion and the related project timeline, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. In 2018, we had an accrual of $0.7 million for anticipated losses on long-term contracts.\nThe table below sets forth our selected operating data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein. The dollar amount and percentage change information below reflects the difference between results in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the combined results for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017 and the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Measures\n (1) Represents non-recurring legal costs and expenses, which amounts are not representative of those that we historically incur in the ordinary course of our business. \nThe Maintenance and Technical Services segment generates revenue through our fossil services and nuclear services offerings. Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are most closely associated with the ongoing operations of power plants, whether in the form of daily environmental management or required maintenance services (typically during planned outages). Our fossil services offerings focus on recurring and mission-critical management of coal ash and routine maintenance, outage services and staffing solutions for coal-fired power generation facilities to fulfill an environmental service need of our customers in handling their waste byproducts. Our nuclear services operations, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, consists of a broad platform of mission-critical professional, technical, and craft services spanning the entire asset life cycle of a nuclear power generator. The services are performed on the customer's site and the contract terms typically range from three to five years. Revenues are billed and paid during the periods of time work is being executed. Our nuclear services revenues tend to be seasonal and may experience significant increases during periods of shutdowns of generators. This combination of the maintenance and environmental-related services deepens customer connectivity and drives long-term relationships which we believe is critical for renewing existing contracts, winning incremental business from existing customers at new sites, and adding new customers. Over the last five years, we have achieved an approximately 90% renewal rate for contracts in our fossil services offerings up for renewal.\nOperating Activities\nRevenues from contract claims are recognized when invoiced. Revenues from contract change orders are recognized when it is probable that the change order will be approved, the amount can be reasonably estimated, and the work has been completed.\nNet Income (Loss). Net income decreased $21.4 million, or 142.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $(6.4) million as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in general and administrative expenses and interest expense, net, as disclosed above, offset by an income tax benefit of $2.4 million and increases in revenues and gross profit as disclosed above.\nCost Management and Capital Investment Efficiency\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with preparing our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nGoodwill\nWe believe there is a significant pipeline of coal ash ponds and landfills that will require remediation and/or closure in the future. Due to their scale and complexity, these environmental remediation projects are typically completed over longer periods of time. As a result, our revenues from these projects can fluctuate over time. Some of our revenues from projects are recognized using percentage of completion accounting for GAAP purposes. This method of revenue recognition is determined by estimating the percentage of completion on a project and the ultimate estimated gross profit margin on the project. The timing of revenues\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $22.1 million, or 303.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $(14.8) million from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable to net proceeds from loan financings of $114.0 million and capital contributions of $10.0 million, offset by distributions to members of $136.0 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $25.1 million, or 48.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $76.8 million as compared to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to additional general and administrative expenses associated with our nuclear services offerings, including some non-recurring legal costs and accruals, as disclosed in our Adjusted EBITDA calculation included herein, in addition to increased expenses due to the addition of SCB.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\n\nEnvironmental Solutions Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Environmental Solutions segment increased $3.6 million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $69.5 million as compared to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the early completion of the Brickhaven ash remediation contract, which accelerated revenues and expenses related to this contract into 2018 and had a net positive impact on gross profit for the year. Under the terms of the Brickhaven contract, we expect to receive a significant cash payment from our customer in 2019, subject to the customer's final confirmation of the contract's early completion pursuant to the terms of the contract. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included $5.4 million attributable to the addition of SCB.\nThe power generation industry has increased annual spending on environmental liability management. We believe this is the result of not only regulatory and consumer pressure, but also the industry's increasing focus on environmental stewardship. Continued increases in spending on environmental liability management by our customers should result in increased demand for services across our platform.\nOn June 18, 2018, we completed the IPO of 7,352,941 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The net proceeds of the IPO to us prior to offering expenses were approximately $59.2 million. We used a portion of the IPO proceeds to pay off approximately $40.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan, and any remaining net proceeds were used to pay offering expenses or for general corporate purposes.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition on Construction Contracts\n (2) Uncertain tax positions, the purchase option liability, contingent payments for acquisitions, and the asset retirement obligation are not included in the table above because timing of such payments is uncertain. \nIncome from Equity Method Investment. Income from equity method investment decreased $1.8 million, or 68.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $0.9 million as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in ash volumes generated by the utility and available for sale by us.\nOn January 13, 2017, Charah Management completed a transaction with BCP, a previously unrelated third party. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. By the application of push-down\u201d accounting, Charah's assets, liabilities and equity were accordingly adjusted to fair value. The fair value estimates used reflect our best estimates for the highest and best use by market participants.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Maintenance and Technical Services segment increased $9.9 million, or 54.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $28.3 million as compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, which did not have a full year of operations in 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $16.5 million, or 46.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $51.7 million as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to $18.9 million of additional expenses associated with our nuclear services offerings, including $14.8 million of non-recurring and non-operating legal costs (including legal costs associated with outstanding litigation as disclosed in Note 18 to our audited financial statements included herein) and non-recurring startup costs, as disclosed in our Adjusted EBITDA calculation included herein.\nThe Company performed quantitative assessments of its Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services reporting units as of October 1, 2018. The Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services reporting units' fair values, as calculated, were approximately 7.0% and 130.1%, respectively, greater than their book values as of October 1, 2018.\nWe are a leading provider of mission-critical environmental and maintenance services to the power generation industry, enabling our customers to address challenges related to the remediation of ash ponds and landfills at open and closed power plant sites while continuously operating and providing necessary electric power to communities nationwide. We offer a suite of coal ash management and recycling, environmental remediation, and outage maintenance services. We also design and implement solutions for complex environmental projects (such as coal ash pond closures) and facilitate coal ash recycling through byproduct sales and other beneficial use services.

We believe that revenues are a meaningful indicator of the demand and pricing for our services.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility also contains certain affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements (such as delivery of financial statements, certificates, and notices of certain events), maintaining insurance, and providing additional guarantees and collateral in certain circumstances.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility includes customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross default to certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments, and change of control.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $13.6 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $97.7 million as compared to $84.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit was 13.2% and 19.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross profit by segment was as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.0 million, or 28.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $76.0 million as compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 17.7%, a decrease of 5.0% from 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Revolving Loan provides a principal amount of up to $50.0 million reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, $19.8 million was outstanding on the Revolving Loan and $12.5 million of letters of credit were outstanding.\nFinancing Activities\nbyproduct sales offerings in the amount of $12.4 million and the elimination of negative gross profit associated with our non-acquired business line of $2.4 million.\nOperating Income\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Syndicated Credit Facility.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually, as of October 1st of each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment is not performed, or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then the reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach based on discounted cash flows. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows, and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units' expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units' earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value.\ncompliance under the Exchange Act, annual and quarterly reports to common stockholders, registrar and transfer agent fees, national stock exchange fees, audit fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs, and director and officer compensation.\nThe Environmental Solutions segment generates revenue through our remediation and compliance services, as well as byproduct sales offerings. Our remediation and compliance services offerings primarily consist of designing, constructing, managing, remediating, and closing ash ponds and landfills on customer-owned sites. Our byproduct sales offerings include the recycling of recurring and contracted volumes of coal-fired power generation waste byproducts, such as bottom ash, fly ash, and gypsum byproduct, each of which can be used for various industrial purposes. Our platform of services is contracted for terms generally ranging from 18 months to five years, thereby reducing financial volatility. In excess of 90% of our services work is structured as time and materials, cost reimbursable, or unit price contracts, which significantly reduces the risk of loss on contracts and provides gross margin visibility. Revenue from management contracts is recognized when the ash is hauled to the landfill or the management services are provided. Revenue from the sales of ash is recognized when it is delivered to the customer.\n \u2022 Gross Profit; \n (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.  Revenues. Revenues increased $165.3 million, or 62.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $430.4 million as compared to $265.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues by segment was as follows:\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $33.1 million, or 455.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $40.4 million from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the $20.0 million used in 2018 for business acquisitions, net of cash received, and an increase in cash purchases of property and equipment.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, elimination of certain legacy expenses, amounts from a non-acquired business line, non-recurring legal and startup costs, and transaction related expenses and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues (which for the year ended December 31, 2016 was less revenues ($5,045) of a non-acquired business line).\nWe analyze our operating income, which we define as revenues less cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, to measure our financial performance. We believe operating income is a meaningful metric because it provides insight on profitability and operating performance based on the cost basis of our assets. We also compare operating income to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods.\nAbility to Capture New Contracts and Opportunities\nRevenues. Revenues increased $310.1 million, or 72.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $740.5 million as compared to $430.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues by segment was as follows:\n2018 was a transitional year as we moved from a private to a public company with the IPO in June 2018. We continued to grow our operations with increased work in the nuclear power maintenance industry and improved our byproduct sales offerings with the acquisition of SCB in March 2018. Additionally, we resolved a significant legal matter that existed prior to the IPO. Additional information regarding the results of operations follows below.\nOperating Activities\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility contains various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to specified exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to grant liens, incur indebtedness (including guarantees), make investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, make dispositions of assets, make restricted payments, or change the nature of our or our subsidiaries' business. The Syndicated Credit Facility contains financial covenants related to the consolidated net leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio (of 1.20 to 1.00). We are required to comply with a consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.00 through March 30, 2020, decreasing to 3.50 to 1.00 as of March 31,\nEnvironmental Solutions Revenues. Environmental Solutions segment revenues increased $22.0 million, or 10.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $240.0 million as compared to $218.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our remediation and compliance services offerings in the amount of $26.3 million, partially offset by a reduction in revenues related to our non-acquired business line of $5.0 million.\nEnvironmental Solutions Revenues. Environmental Solutions segment revenues increased $103.1 million, or 42.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $343.1 million as compared to $240.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $45.8 million of revenue associated with the addition of SCB that occurred in March 2018, in addition to a net overall increase in revenue from our remediation and compliance services offerings.\nassets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our consolidated combined financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates.\n \u2022 First, under percentage of completion accounting, we accelerated revenues and expenses (including depreciation and amortization) related to this project from 2019 into the third and fourth quarters of 2018.

The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. For more information on the business combination, see Note 2 to our consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur Debt Agreements\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as an important indicator of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, and income taxes, elimination of certain legacy expenses, amounts from a non-acquired business line, and transaction related expenses and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues. See -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCharah Solutions, Inc.\nOn September 21, 2018, we entered into the Syndicated Credit Facility, providing for a Term Loan with an initial commitment of $205.0 million. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay amounts outstanding under the CS Term Loan. As of December 31, 2018, we had $202.4 million outstanding under the Term Loan.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company,\u201d which allows us to have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. We intend to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 107 of the JOBS Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Syndicated Credit Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at our election, either (i) the LIBOR rate, or (ii) an alternative base rate. Various margins are added to the interest rate based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio. Customary fees are payable in respect of the Syndicated Credit Facility and include (i) commitment fees (ranging from 0.25% to 0.35% based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio) for unused portions of the Syndicated Credit Facility, and (ii) fees on outstanding letters of credit (ranging from 1.30% to 2.10% based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio). Amounts borrowed under the Syndicated Credit Facility are secured by essentially all assets of the Company.\nPublic Company Costs\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nOur working capital, which we define as total current assets less total current liabilities, totaled $74.1 million and $12.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of a $78.8 million increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, a $24.1 million increase in inventory, a $14.5 million decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and a $13.5 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by a $25.4 million decrease in cash, a $25.0 million increase in asset retirement obligation, a $14.5 million increase in accrued expenses, a $9.6 million increase in accounts payable, and a $5.1 million increase in purchase option liability.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA; and \nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018: \n (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures.

Overview of Financial Results:\nImpact of Brickhaven Accelerated Depreciation. As noted above, the accelerated completion of the Brickhaven ash remediation contract was an important factor in our third and fourth quarter 2018 results. Brickhaven is very different from our other remediation projects because we purchased, developed and permitted the site several years ago, requiring significant capital investment by us. We did this in conjunction with a contract under which our customer would supply ash that we would store at the Brickhaven site and an adjacent mine owned by us, and we would be reimbursed for our costs, including a return, on a per-ton basis. Riverbend is a retired power plant that is one of two from which we sourced ash but the contract contemplated follow-on sites, aggregating to approximately 20 million tons of ash that would be supplied to these mines. Due to a change in North Carolina law, the customer determined that it would not supply ash to these mines once Riverbend was completed. Under the terms of the contract, we expect to receive a significant payment from the customer for unrecovered project development costs and expected site closing costs. The early completion of the Brickhaven contract affected our 2018 results in two significant ways:\nOn September 21, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the Syndicated Credit Facility\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Syndicated Credit Facility includes:\nInvesting Activities\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful performance measures because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts are either non-recurring or can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $8.6 million, or 54.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.3 million from $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the elimination of a restricted cash requirement associated with one of our projects, an increase in purchases of property and equipment, net of sales, and other investing cash outflows in 2016 that did not recur in 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $45.0 million, or 539.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $53.4 million from $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in net change in working capital of $41.0 million and other items.\nCharah Solutions is a C\u201d Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and, as a result, is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes. In connection with the IPO, Charah and Allied, which previously were flow-through entities for income tax purposes and were indirect subsidiaries of two partnerships, Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, respectively, became indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Prior to the contribution, Charah and Allied passed through their taxable income to the owners of the partnerships for U.S. federal and other state and local income tax purposes and, thus, were not subject to U.S. federal income taxes or other state or local income taxes, except for franchise tax at the state level (at less than 1% of modified pre-tax earnings). Accordingly, the financial data attributable to Charah and Allied prior to the contribution on June 18, 2018 contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality other than franchise taxes.\nOperations of Allied Power Management, LLC\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nrecorded for financial reporting purposes may differ from actual billings to customers, sometimes resulting in costs and billing in excess of actual revenues. Because of the risks in estimating long-term projects, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nTerm Loan\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $22.3 million, or 36.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $84.2 million as compared to $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit was 19.6% and 23.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in gross profit by segment was as follows:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThrough our ownership of Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, we own the outstanding equity interests in Charah and Allied, the subsidiaries through which we operate our businesses.\nFor a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nEnvironmental Solutions. Our Environmental Solutions segment includes remediation and compliance services, as well as byproduct sales offerings. Remediation and compliance services are associated with our customers' need for multi-year environmental improvement and sustainability initiatives, whether driven by proactive engagement, by power generation customers, by regulatory requirements, or by consumer expectations and standards. Byproduct sales support both our power generation customers' desire to profitably recycle recurring and historic volumes of CCRs and our ultimate end customers' need for high-quality, cost-effective raw material substitutes.\nMaintenance and Technical Services. Our Maintenance and Technical Services segment includes fossil services and, from and after May 2017 when Allied was created, nuclear services. Fossil services are the recurring and mission-critical management of coal ash and the routine maintenance, outage services and staffing solutions for coal-fired power generation facilities. Nuclear services, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, include routine maintenance, outage services, facility maintenance, and staffing solutions for nuclear power generation facilities. The Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are most closely associated with the ongoing operations of power plants, whether in the form of daily environmental management or required maintenance services (typically during planned outages).\nWe use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our operations, including:\nThe principal amount of the CS Term Loan amortized at a rate of 7.5% per annum with all remaining outstanding amounts under the CS Term Loan due on the CS Term Loan maturity date. We received net proceeds from the IPO of $59.2 million prior to deducting offering expenses. We used these net proceeds to pay offering expenses and to pay off $40.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under the CS Term Loan, which would otherwise have been required through June 2020.\nThe successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGoodwill represents the cost of an acquisition purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets, and such amounts are reported separately as goodwill on our consolidated and combined balance sheets. Our total goodwill resulted from the application of push-down\u201d accounting associated with BCP's January 2017 acquisition of a controlling equity position in Charah Management and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of SCB.\nGross Profit\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d reflecting our current expectations, estimates, and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes, and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere herein. Please read Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Also, please read the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere herein. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nByproduct Recycling Market Dynamics\nBased on historic trends, we expect our operating results to vary seasonally. Nuclear power generators perform turnaround and outages in the off-peak months when demand is lower and generation capacity is less constrained. As a result, our nuclear services offerings may have higher revenue volume in the spring and fall months. Variations in normal weather patterns can also cause changes in the consumption of energy, which may influence demand and timing of associated services for our fossil services offerings. Inclement weather can impact construction-related activities associated with pond and landfill remediation, which affects the timing of revenue generation within remediation and compliance services. Byproduct sales are also impacted during winter months when the utilization of cement and cement products is generally lower.\n\nWe analyze our gross profit, which we define as revenues less cost of sales, to measure our financial performance. We believe gross profit is a meaningful metric because it provides insight on financial performance of our revenue streams without consideration of Company overhead. When analyzing gross profit, we compare actual gross profit to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods to assess our performance.\nOur capital spending consists primarily of equipment costs associated with performance and completion of our contracts, including the replacement of dated and obsolete equipment, and the rollout of technology units that were acquired as part of our acquisition of SCB. However, the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer or increase a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, additional contracts awarded above and beyond our projections, and/or the increase or decrease in the useful life of our equipment. As we pursue growth, we monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities, and liquidity requirements. Based upon the current industry outlook, we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the ability to maintain existing contracts, to obtain new contracts, and to manage our operating expenses. The failure to achieve anticipated revenue and cash flows from operations could result in a reduction in future capital spending. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event we make additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures or to seek additional capital. We cannot assure you that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\n\u2022A revolving loan not to exceed $50.0 million (the Revolving Loan\u201d);\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nWe are an environmental remediation and maintenance company and conduct our operations through two segments: Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities decreased $67.0 million, or 125.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $(13.6) million from $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $21.4 million decrease in net income as explained above, a $73.0 million decrease in cash resulting from the increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings primarily related to Brickhaven, a $30.4 million decrease in cash resulting from the decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and an $8.4 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $23.3 million, an increase in asset retirement obligation of $24.8 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $10.8 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $8.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nto gross profit but the benefit to Adjusted EBITDA was significantly greater because of the capital-intensive nature of the Brickhaven asset and the acceleration of depreciation. Of the $49 million of depreciation expense related to property, plant, and equipment we recorded in 2018, approximately $38 million was for Brickhaven and related equipment. Had we not had an early completion of the project, depreciation would have been significantly less. We also recorded $15 million of amortization of a purchase option liability related to Brickhaven, which reduced general and administrative expenses. Net of this negative amortization, total depreciation and amortization associated with Brickhaven was $23 million. Because the Riverbend project was completed in March 2019, the amount of revenues and depreciation associated with Brickhaven in 2019 will be substantially lower. Going forward, we expect that cost of goods sold will be more closely aligned with cash costs, consistent with the less capital-intensive nature that is typical of most of our remediation projects.\nOn October 25, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent. The Revolving Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), with a principal amount of up to $45.0 million. The Credit Facility permitted extensions of credit up to the lesser of $45.0 million and a borrowing base that was calculated by us based upon a percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory, and approved by the administrative agent.\nThe CS Term Loan had a maturity date of October 25, 2024; however, all amounts outstanding were repaid in September 2018 as a result of the refinancing discussed above.\nThe CS Term Loan contained various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants. In addition, we were required to comply with a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1.00 beginning March 31, 2018, decreasing to 4.50 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2019, and further decreasing to 4.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2020 and thereafter.\nThere is a growing demand for recycled coal ash across a variety of applications, in addition to the market forces and governmental regulations driving the need to dispose of coal ash in an environmentally sensitive manner. Pricing of byproduct sales is driven by supply and demand market dynamics, in addition to the chemical and physical properties of the ash. As demand increases for the end products that use recycled coal-fired power generation waste byproducts (i.e., concrete for construction and infrastructure projects), the demand for recycled coal ash also typically rises. These fluctuations affect the relative demand for our byproduct sales offerings. In recessionary periods, construction and infrastructure spending and the corresponding need for concrete may decline. However, this unfavorable effect may be partially offset by an increase in the demand for recycled coal ash during a recessionary period given coal ash is more cost-effective than other alternatives.\n \u2022 Second, we had an increase of unbilled costs on our balance sheet, shown as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, or CIE, which reduced operating cash flow by $79 million and thereby resulted in cash flow used in operations of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As we expect to substantially recover this amount in 2019, these working capital balances will reverse and generate significant cash flow.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nDetermining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices, and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the consolidated and combined financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n (1) We lease equipment and office facilities under non-cancellable operating leases. \nNet Income (Loss). Net income decreased $8.1 million, or 35.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $15.0 million as compared to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in general and administrative expenses noted above, along with an increase in interest expense, net, offset by increases in revenues and gross profit associated with our projects, including the addition of our nuclear services offerings.\nPower Generation Industry Spend on Environmental Liability Management and Regulatory Requirements\n (3) Primary components include a change in charitable giving and other business expense policies associated with the BCP investment. \nOn October 25, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent, providing for a term loan (the CS Term Loan\u201d) with an initial commitment of $250.0 million. The CS Term Loan provided that we had the right at any time to request incremental term loans up to the greater of (i) the excess, if any, of $25.0 million over the aggregate amount of all incremental Credit Facility commitments and incremental term loan commitments previously utilized, and (ii) such other amount so long as such amount at such time could be incurred without causing the pro forma consolidated secured leverage ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1.00.\n (5) Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues (which for the year ended December 31, 2016 were less revenues ($5,045) of a non-acquired business line). We use Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure the success of our businesses in managing our cost base and improving profitability. \nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Credit Facility were based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at our election, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus a 2.00% borrowing margin, or (ii) an alternative base rate plus a 1.00% borrowing margin. Customary fees were payable in respect of the Credit\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increased $12.1 million, or 193.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $18.3 million as compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We incurred $4.1 million of costs associated with debt retirement in conjunction with BCP's investment, which was recorded during the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017. During the period from January 13, 2017 to December 31, 2017, $6.1 million of non-cash debt issuance costs were expensed primarily due to the refinancing of our debt in October 2017. Additionally, we had higher interest costs associated with the increase in our debt balances in 2017.\nWe were formed in January 2018 in anticipation of the IPO to be a holding company for Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings. The historical financial data presented herein as of December 31, 2018 and for periods after the June 18, 2018 corporate reorganization is that of Charah and Allied on a consolidated basis, and on a combined basis for periods prior to the June 18, 2018 corporate reorganization. Allied was formed in May 2017 and did not commence operations until July 2017.\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 Revenues; \nMaintenance and Technical Services Revenues. Maintenance and Technical Services segment revenues increased $143.3 million, or 304.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $190.3 million as compared to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings in the amount of $136.2 million, in addition to the net increase in revenues on fossil services projects of $7.1 million.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Revenues. Maintenance and Technical Services segment revenues increased $207.0 million, or 108.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $397.4 million as compared to $190.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, which did not have a full year of operations in 2017.\n (2) Represents non-recurring startup costs associated with the startup of Allied and our nuclear services offerings, including the setup of financial operations systems and modules, pre-contract expenses to obtain initial contracts, and the hiring of operational staff. Because these costs are associated with the initial setup of the Allied business to initiate the operations involved in our nuclear services offerings, these costs are non-recurring in the normal course of our business. \nWe have entered into various equipment financing arrangements to finance the acquisition of certain equipment (the Equipment Financing Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had equipment lines of credit allowing borrowings of $22.0 million, of which $17.9 million was utilized. In addition, we had $17.2 million of equipment notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Each of the Equipment Financing Facilities include non-financial covenants, and, as of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nPlease see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our historical consolidated and combined financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, included elsewhere herein, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nThe table below sets forth our selected operating data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.

The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the $59.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, which was used to make $40.0 million of principal payments towards our term loan and also pay $8.9 million of costs associated with the IPO. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was also impacted by the refinancing of debt that occurred in the third quarter of 2018 and the first quarter of 2017, the acquisition of Charah by BCP in the first quarter of 2017, and a reduction in distributions to members in 2018.\n \u2022 Operating Income; \nThe table below sets forth our cash flows for the years indicated.

Revenues\nAsset Acquisition and Business Combinations\nProject-Based Nature of Environmental Remediation Mandates\nOverview\n2020, further decreasing to 3.25 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2021, and finally decreasing to 3.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2022 and thereafter.\nOur ability to grow revenue and earnings is dependent on maintaining and increasing our market share, renewing existing contracts, and obtaining additional contracts from proactive bidding on contracts with new and existing customers. We proactively work with existing customers ahead of contract end dates to attempt to secure contract renewals. We also leverage the embedded long-term nature of our customer relationships to obtain insight into and to capture new business opportunities across our platform.\nHow We Generate Revenues\nare significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance, such as a company's cost of capital and tax structure, as well as the historic costs of depreciable assets, none of which are reflected in Adjusted EBITDA. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an indication that our results will be unaffected by the items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be identical to other similarly titled measures of other companies. We use Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure the success for our business in managing our cost base and improving profitability. The following tables present reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), our most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, along with our Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nAs a new public company, we expect to incur incremental recurring and certain non-recurring costs related to our transition to a publicly traded and taxable corporation, including the costs of the IPO and the costs associated with the initial implementation of our Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 internal control implementation and testing. We also expect to incur additional significant and recurring expenses as a publicly traded company, including costs associated with the employment of additional personnel,\n\u2022A term loan of $205.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d); and\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net increased $13.9 million, or 75.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $32.2 million as compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $12.5 million of costs incurred in conjunction with the refinance of our debt, consisting of a $10.4 million write-off of non-cash debt issuance costs and a $2.1 million prepayment penalty, in addition to an increase in our debt balances. We incurred $4.1 million of costs associated with debt retirement in conjunction with BCP's investment in us, which was recorded during the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017.\nSyndicated Credit Facility\nThe Credit Facility contained various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants. If excess availability under the Credit Facility fell below the greater of 15% of the loan cap amount or $6.75 million, we were required to comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.0 to 1.0. The Credit Facility did not otherwise contain financial maintenance covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had total liquidity of approximately $50 million, comprised of $6.9 million of cash on hand, $18 million availability under the Revolving Loan and $25 million of delayed draw availability under the Term Loan.\nCapital Requirements and Sources of Liquidity\nIncome from Equity Method Investment. Income from equity method investment increased $1.5 million, or 178.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.4 million as compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to a price increase of the products sold through this joint venture and an increase in ash volumes generated by the utility and available for sale by us.\nFactors Impacting the Comparability of Results of Operations\nEquipment Financing Facilities\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased $22.8 million, or 29.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $98.8 million as compared to $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 13.3%, a decrease of 4.3% from 17.7% for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to the gross profit increase described above and the early completion of the Brickhaven contract.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are not financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP.\nInitial Public Offering\nThe Credit Facility had a scheduled maturity date of October 25, 2022; however, all amounts outstanding were repaid in September 2018 as a result of the refinancing discussed below.\nThe table below sets forth our cash flows for the years indicated. The successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nThe asset, Costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings\u201d represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed on uncompleted contracts.

Gross profit for our Environmental Solutions segment increased $14.6 million, or 28.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $65.8 million as compared to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit from our remediation and compliance services and\nFinancing Activities\nMaintenance and Technical Services Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Maintenance and Technical Services segment increased $7.8 million, or 73.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $18.3 million as compared to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, in addition to the net increase in gross profit on fossil services projects.\nCharah Solutions was formed in January 2018 and did not conduct any material business operations prior to the transactions described under -Initial Public Offering.\u201d In connection with the closing of our initial public offering (the IPO\u201d), and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the master reorganization agreement, dated June 13, 2018, Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ( Allied Power Holdings\u201d), became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in our audited historical consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein. We believe that the Company's primary critical accounting policy is its policy regarding accounting for long-term contracts. This policy is the most critical to fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results, and requires management's most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain.\n (4) Non-acquired business line item adjusts for a legacy operation of Charah that was transferred to a stockholder of CEP Holdings, Inc. in January 2017 prior to the BCP investment. \nOur main operating costs consist of labor and material costs and equipment maintenance. We maintain a focus on cost management and efficiency, including monitoring labor costs, both in terms of wage rates and headcount, along with other costs such as materials and equipment. We maintain a disciplined approach to capital expenditure decisions, which are typically associated with specific contract requirements. Furthermore, we strive to extend the useful life of our equipment through the application of a well-planned routine maintenance program.\nAccounting for construction contracts involves management judgment in estimating total contract revenues and costs. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Contract costs are incurred over a period of time, which can be several years, and the estimation of these costs requires management judgment. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, and asset utilization. We have a process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our contracts. As part of this process, management reviews information, including any outstanding key contract matters, progress toward completion and the related project timeline, and the related changes in estimates of revenues and costs. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. In 2018, we had an accrual of $0.7 million for anticipated losses on long-term contracts.\nThe table below sets forth our selected operating data for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. The successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein. The dollar amount and percentage change information below reflects the difference between results in the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the combined results for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017 and the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017.\nNon-GAAP Measures\n (1) Represents non-recurring legal costs and expenses, which amounts are not representative of those that we historically incur in the ordinary course of our business. \nThe Maintenance and Technical Services segment generates revenue through our fossil services and nuclear services offerings. Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are most closely associated with the ongoing operations of power plants, whether in the form of daily environmental management or required maintenance services (typically during planned outages). Our fossil services offerings focus on recurring and mission-critical management of coal ash and routine maintenance, outage services and staffing solutions for coal-fired power generation facilities to fulfill an environmental service need of our customers in handling their waste byproducts. Our nuclear services operations, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, consists of a broad platform of mission-critical professional, technical, and craft services spanning the entire asset life cycle of a nuclear power generator. The services are performed on the customer's site and the contract terms typically range from three to five years. Revenues are billed and paid during the periods of time work is being executed. Our nuclear services revenues tend to be seasonal and may experience significant increases during periods of shutdowns of generators. This combination of the maintenance and environmental-related services deepens customer connectivity and drives long-term relationships which we believe is critical for renewing existing contracts, winning incremental business from existing customers at new sites, and adding new customers. Over the last five years, we have achieved an approximately 90% renewal rate for contracts in our fossil services offerings up for renewal.\nOperating Activities\nRevenues from contract claims are recognized when invoiced. Revenues from contract change orders are recognized when it is probable that the change order will be approved, the amount can be reasonably estimated, and the work has been completed.\nNet Income (Loss). Net income decreased $21.4 million, or 142.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $(6.4) million as compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in general and administrative expenses and interest expense, net, as disclosed above, offset by an income tax benefit of $2.4 million and increases in revenues and gross profit as disclosed above.\nCost Management and Capital Investment Efficiency\nOur financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. In connection with preparing our financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of\nGoodwill\nWe believe there is a significant pipeline of coal ash ponds and landfills that will require remediation and/or closure in the future. Due to their scale and complexity, these environmental remediation projects are typically completed over longer periods of time. As a result, our revenues from these projects can fluctuate over time. Some of our revenues from projects are recognized using percentage of completion accounting for GAAP purposes. This method of revenue recognition is determined by estimating the percentage of completion on a project and the ultimate estimated gross profit margin on the project. The timing of revenues\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities decreased $22.1 million, or 303.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $(14.8) million from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was attributable to net proceeds from loan financings of $114.0 million and capital contributions of $10.0 million, offset by distributions to members of $136.0 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $25.1 million, or 48.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $76.8 million as compared to $51.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to additional general and administrative expenses associated with our nuclear services offerings, including some non-recurring legal costs and accruals, as disclosed in our Adjusted EBITDA calculation included herein, in addition to increased expenses due to the addition of SCB.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nContractual and Commercial Commitments\n\nEnvironmental Solutions Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Environmental Solutions segment increased $3.6 million, or 5.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $69.5 million as compared to $65.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the early completion of the Brickhaven ash remediation contract, which accelerated revenues and expenses related to this contract into 2018 and had a net positive impact on gross profit for the year. Under the terms of the Brickhaven contract, we expect to receive a significant cash payment from our customer in 2019, subject to the customer's final confirmation of the contract's early completion pursuant to the terms of the contract. Gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included $5.4 million attributable to the addition of SCB.\nThe power generation industry has increased annual spending on environmental liability management. We believe this is the result of not only regulatory and consumer pressure, but also the industry's increasing focus on environmental stewardship. Continued increases in spending on environmental liability management by our customers should result in increased demand for services across our platform.\nOn June 18, 2018, we completed the IPO of 7,352,941 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share. The net proceeds of the IPO to us prior to offering expenses were approximately $59.2 million. We used a portion of the IPO proceeds to pay off approximately $40.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan, and any remaining net proceeds were used to pay offering expenses or for general corporate purposes.\nRevenue and Cost Recognition on Construction Contracts\n (2) Uncertain tax positions, the purchase option liability, contingent payments for acquisitions, and the asset retirement obligation are not included in the table above because timing of such payments is uncertain. \nIncome from Equity Method Investment. Income from equity method investment decreased $1.8 million, or 68.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $0.9 million as compared to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in ash volumes generated by the utility and available for sale by us.\nOn January 13, 2017, Charah Management completed a transaction with BCP, a previously unrelated third party. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. By the application of push-down\u201d accounting, Charah's assets, liabilities and equity were accordingly adjusted to fair value. The fair value estimates used reflect our best estimates for the highest and best use by market participants.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Gross Profit. Gross profit for our Maintenance and Technical Services segment increased $9.9 million, or 54.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $28.3 million as compared to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, which did not have a full year of operations in 2017.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses increased $16.5 million, or 46.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $51.7 million as compared to $35.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to $18.9 million of additional expenses associated with our nuclear services offerings, including $14.8 million of non-recurring and non-operating legal costs (including legal costs associated with outstanding litigation as disclosed in Note 18 to our audited financial statements included herein) and non-recurring startup costs, as disclosed in our Adjusted EBITDA calculation included herein.\nThe Company performed quantitative assessments of its Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services reporting units as of October 1, 2018. The Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services reporting units' fair values, as calculated, were approximately 7.0% and 130.1%, respectively, greater than their book values as of October 1, 2018.\nWe are a leading provider of mission-critical environmental and maintenance services to the power generation industry, enabling our customers to address challenges related to the remediation of ash ponds and landfills at open and closed power plant sites while continuously operating and providing necessary electric power to communities nationwide. We offer a suite of coal ash management and recycling, environmental remediation, and outage maintenance services. We also design and implement solutions for complex environmental projects (such as coal ash pond closures) and facilitate coal ash recycling through byproduct sales and other beneficial use services. We operate in over 20 states, resulting in an overall footprint and density in key markets that we believe is difficult to replicate.\n\u2022A commitment to loan up to a further $25.0 million, which expires in March 2020.\nFacility and included (i) commitment fees in an amount equal to 0.50% of the daily unused portions of the Credit Facility, and (ii) a 2.00% fee on outstanding letters of credit.\nWe analyze our revenues by comparing actual revenues to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods to assess our performance. We believe that revenues are a meaningful indicator of the demand and pricing for our services.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility also contains certain affirmative covenants, including reporting requirements (such as delivery of financial statements, certificates, and notices of certain events), maintaining insurance, and providing additional guarantees and collateral in certain circumstances.\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility includes customary events of default, including non-payment of principal, interest, or fees, violation of covenants, inaccuracy of representations or warranties, cross default to certain other material indebtedness, bankruptcy and insolvency events, invalidity or impairment of guarantees or security interests, material judgments, and change of control.\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $13.6 million, or 16.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $97.7 million as compared to $84.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit was 13.2% and 19.6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The increase in gross profit by segment was as follows:\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Adjusted EBITDA increased $17.0 million, or 28.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $76.0 million as compared to $59.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and our Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2017 was 17.7%, a decrease of 5.0% from 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe Revolving Loan provides a principal amount of up to $50.0 million reduced by outstanding letters of credit. As of December 31, 2018, $19.8 million was outstanding on the Revolving Loan and $12.5 million of letters of credit were outstanding.\nFinancing Activities\nbyproduct sales offerings in the amount of $12.4 million and the elimination of negative gross profit associated with our non-acquired business line of $2.4 million.\nOperating Income\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all covenants related to the Syndicated Credit Facility.\nGoodwill is not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually, as of October 1st of each year, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level. We may elect to perform a qualitative assessment for our reporting units to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying value. If a qualitative assessment is not performed, or if as a result of a qualitative assessment it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then the reporting unit's fair value is compared to its carrying value. Fair value is typically estimated using an income approach based on discounted cash flows. However, when appropriate, we may also use a market approach. The income approach is based on the long-term projected future cash flows of the reporting units. We discount the estimated cash flows to present value using a weighted average cost of capital that considers factors such as market assumptions, the timing of the cash flows, and the risks inherent in those cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based upon the reporting units' expected long-term performance considering the economic and market conditions that generally affect our business. The market approach estimates fair value by measuring the aggregate market value of publicly traded companies with similar characteristics to our business as a multiple of their reported earnings. We then apply that multiple to the reporting units' earnings to estimate their fair values. We believe that this approach may also be appropriate in certain circumstances because it provides a fair value estimate using valuation inputs from entities with operations and economic characteristics comparable to our reporting units. Fair value is computed using several factors, including projected future operating results, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, comparable marketplace data, and the cost of capital. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and to our judgment in applying them in our analysis. However, we believe our methodology for estimating the fair value of our reporting units is reasonable. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, goodwill is written down to its implied fair value.\ncompliance under the Exchange Act, annual and quarterly reports to common stockholders, registrar and transfer agent fees, national stock exchange fees, audit fees, incremental director and officer liability insurance costs, and director and officer compensation.\nThe Environmental Solutions segment generates revenue through our remediation and compliance services, as well as byproduct sales offerings. Our remediation and compliance services offerings primarily consist of designing, constructing, managing, remediating, and closing ash ponds and landfills on customer-owned sites. Our byproduct sales offerings include the recycling of recurring and contracted volumes of coal-fired power generation waste byproducts, such as bottom ash, fly ash, and gypsum byproduct, each of which can be used for various industrial purposes. Our platform of services is contracted for terms generally ranging from 18 months to five years, thereby reducing financial volatility. In excess of 90% of our services work is structured as time and materials, cost reimbursable, or unit price contracts, which significantly reduces the risk of loss on contracts and provides gross margin visibility. Revenue from management contracts is recognized when the ash is hauled to the landfill or the management services are provided. Revenue from the sales of ash is recognized when it is delivered to the customer.\n \u2022 Gross Profit; \n (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.  Revenues. Revenues increased $165.3 million, or 62.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $430.4 million as compared to $265.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues by segment was as follows:\nNet cash used in investing activities increased $33.1 million, or 455.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $40.4 million from $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows used in investing activities was primarily attributable to the $20.0 million used in 2018 for business acquisitions, net of cash received, and an increase in cash purchases of property and equipment.\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, elimination of certain legacy expenses, amounts from a non-acquired business line, non-recurring legal and startup costs, and transaction related expenses and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues (which for the year ended December 31, 2016 was less revenues ($5,045) of a non-acquired business line).\nWe analyze our operating income, which we define as revenues less cost of sales and general and administrative expenses, to measure our financial performance. We believe operating income is a meaningful metric because it provides insight on profitability and operating performance based on the cost basis of our assets. We also compare operating income to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods.\nAbility to Capture New Contracts and Opportunities\nRevenues. Revenues increased $310.1 million, or 72.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $740.5 million as compared to $430.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in revenues by segment was as follows:\n2018 was a transitional year as we moved from a private to a public company with the IPO in June 2018. We continued to grow our operations with increased work in the nuclear power maintenance industry and improved our byproduct sales offerings with the acquisition of SCB in March 2018. Additionally, we resolved a significant legal matter that existed prior to the IPO. Additional information regarding the results of operations follows below.\nOperating Activities\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nThe Syndicated Credit Facility contains various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants that, among other things and subject to specified exceptions, restrict the ability of us and our restricted subsidiaries to grant liens, incur indebtedness (including guarantees), make investments, engage in mergers and acquisitions, make dispositions of assets, make restricted payments, or change the nature of our or our subsidiaries' business. The Syndicated Credit Facility contains financial covenants related to the consolidated net leverage ratio and the fixed charge coverage ratio (of 1.20 to 1.00). We are required to comply with a consolidated net leverage ratio of 3.75 to 1.00 through March 30, 2020, decreasing to 3.50 to 1.00 as of March 31,\nEnvironmental Solutions Revenues. Environmental Solutions segment revenues increased $22.0 million, or 10.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $240.0 million as compared to $218.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our remediation and compliance services offerings in the amount of $26.3 million, partially offset by a reduction in revenues related to our non-acquired business line of $5.0 million.\nEnvironmental Solutions Revenues. Environmental Solutions segment revenues increased $103.1 million, or 42.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $343.1 million as compared to $240.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to $45.8 million of revenue associated with the addition of SCB that occurred in March 2018, in addition to a net overall increase in revenue from our remediation and compliance services offerings.\nassets, liabilities, revenue, expense, and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates, and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time we prepare our consolidated and combined financial statements. On a regular basis, management reviews the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates, and judgments to ensure that our consolidated combined financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ materially from our assumptions and estimates.\n \u2022 First, under percentage of completion accounting, we accelerated revenues and expenses (including depreciation and amortization) related to this project from 2019 into the third and fourth quarters of 2018. This had a net benefit \nAllied was formed in May 2017 and commenced operations in July 2017. Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect the results of Allied only from the commencement of its operations in July 2017. As a result, our historical financial and operating information for the year ended December 31, 2018 may not be comparable to the historical financial and operating information for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nInvesting Activities\nFor a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nCash Flows\nOn March 31, 2018, Charah Management completed a transaction with SCB and affiliated entities, a previously unrelated third party, pursuant to which Charah acquired certain assets and liabilities of SCB. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. For more information on the business combination, see Note 2 to our consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nSeasonality of Business\nOur Debt Agreements\nWe view Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are non-GAAP financial measures, as an important indicator of performance. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, equity-based compensation, and income taxes, elimination of certain legacy expenses, amounts from a non-acquired business line, and transaction related expenses and other items. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues. See -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d for more information and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nCharah Solutions, Inc.\nOn September 21, 2018, we entered into the Syndicated Credit Facility, providing for a Term Loan with an initial commitment of $205.0 million. The proceeds from the Term Loan were used to repay amounts outstanding under the CS Term Loan. As of December 31, 2018, we had $202.4 million outstanding under the Term Loan.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we meet the definition of an emerging growth company,\u201d which allows us to have an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards pursuant to Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act. We intend to take advantage of all of the reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under Section 107 of the JOBS Act until we are no longer an emerging growth company.\nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Syndicated Credit Facility are based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at our election, either (i) the LIBOR rate, or (ii) an alternative base rate. Various margins are added to the interest rate based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio. Customary fees are payable in respect of the Syndicated Credit Facility and include (i) commitment fees (ranging from 0.25% to 0.35% based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio) for unused portions of the Syndicated Credit Facility, and (ii) fees on outstanding letters of credit (ranging from 1.30% to 2.10% based upon our consolidated net leverage ratio). Amounts borrowed under the Syndicated Credit Facility are secured by essentially all assets of the Company.\nPublic Company Costs\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nOur working capital, which we define as total current assets less total current liabilities, totaled $74.1 million and $12.3 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. This increase in working capital for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily the result of a $78.8 million increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, a $24.1 million increase in inventory, a $14.5 million decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and a $13.5 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by a $25.4 million decrease in cash, a $25.0 million increase in asset retirement obligation, a $14.5 million increase in accrued expenses, a $9.6 million increase in accounts payable, and a $5.1 million increase in purchase option liability.\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA; and \nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018: \n (1) Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are non-GAAP financial measures. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to our most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read -Non-GAAP Measures\u201d below.  Overview of Financial Results:\nImpact of Brickhaven Accelerated Depreciation. As noted above, the accelerated completion of the Brickhaven ash remediation contract was an important factor in our third and fourth quarter 2018 results. Brickhaven is very different from our other remediation projects because we purchased, developed and permitted the site several years ago, requiring significant capital investment by us. We did this in conjunction with a contract under which our customer would supply ash that we would store at the Brickhaven site and an adjacent mine owned by us, and we would be reimbursed for our costs, including a return, on a per-ton basis. Riverbend is a retired power plant that is one of two from which we sourced ash but the contract contemplated follow-on sites, aggregating to approximately 20 million tons of ash that would be supplied to these mines. Due to a change in North Carolina law, the customer determined that it would not supply ash to these mines once Riverbend was completed. Under the terms of the contract, we expect to receive a significant payment from the customer for unrecovered project development costs and expected site closing costs. The early completion of the Brickhaven contract affected our 2018 results in two significant ways:\nOn September 21, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the Syndicated Credit Facility\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Syndicated Credit Facility includes:\nInvesting Activities\nWe believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin are useful performance measures because they allow for an effective evaluation of our operating performance when compared to our peers, without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts are either non-recurring or can vary substantially within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income determined in accordance with GAAP. Certain items excluded from Adjusted EBITDA\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $8.6 million, or 54.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $7.3 million from $15.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows used in investing activities was attributable to the elimination of a restricted cash requirement associated with one of our projects, an increase in purchases of property and equipment, net of sales, and other investing cash outflows in 2016 that did not recur in 2017.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $45.0 million, or 539.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $53.4 million from $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The change in cash flows used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in net change in working capital of $41.0 million and other items.\nCharah Solutions is a C\u201d Corporation under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code\u201d), and, as a result, is subject to U.S. federal, state, and local income taxes. In connection with the IPO, Charah and Allied, which previously were flow-through entities for income tax purposes and were indirect subsidiaries of two partnerships, Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, respectively, became indirect subsidiaries of the Company. Prior to the contribution, Charah and Allied passed through their taxable income to the owners of the partnerships for U.S. federal and other state and local income tax purposes and, thus, were not subject to U.S. federal income taxes or other state or local income taxes, except for franchise tax at the state level (at less than 1% of modified pre-tax earnings). Accordingly, the financial data attributable to Charah and Allied prior to the contribution on June 18, 2018 contains no provision for U.S. federal income taxes or income taxes in any state or locality other than franchise taxes.\nOperations of Allied Power Management, LLC\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nrecorded for financial reporting purposes may differ from actual billings to customers, sometimes resulting in costs and billing in excess of actual revenues. Because of the risks in estimating long-term projects, actual results may differ from these estimates.\nTerm Loan\nGross Profit. Gross profit increased $22.3 million, or 36.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $84.2 million as compared to $61.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit was 19.6% and 23.3% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in gross profit by segment was as follows:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nThrough our ownership of Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings, we own the outstanding equity interests in Charah and Allied, the subsidiaries through which we operate our businesses.\nFor a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and the calculation of Adjusted EBITDA margin, as well as a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, see -Non-GAAP Measures.\u201d\nEnvironmental Solutions. Our Environmental Solutions segment includes remediation and compliance services, as well as byproduct sales offerings. Remediation and compliance services are associated with our customers' need for multi-year environmental improvement and sustainability initiatives, whether driven by proactive engagement, by power generation customers, by regulatory requirements, or by consumer expectations and standards. Byproduct sales support both our power generation customers' desire to profitably recycle recurring and historic volumes of CCRs and our ultimate end customers' need for high-quality, cost-effective raw material substitutes.\nMaintenance and Technical Services. Our Maintenance and Technical Services segment includes fossil services and, from and after May 2017 when Allied was created, nuclear services. Fossil services are the recurring and mission-critical management of coal ash and the routine maintenance, outage services and staffing solutions for coal-fired power generation facilities. Nuclear services, which we market under the Allied Power brand name, include routine maintenance, outage services, facility maintenance, and staffing solutions for nuclear power generation facilities. The Maintenance and Technical Services segment offerings are most closely associated with the ongoing operations of power plants, whether in the form of daily environmental management or required maintenance services (typically during planned outages).\nWe use a variety of financial and operational metrics to assess the performance of our operations, including:\nThe principal amount of the CS Term Loan amortized at a rate of 7.5% per annum with all remaining outstanding amounts under the CS Term Loan due on the CS Term Loan maturity date. We received net proceeds from the IPO of $59.2 million prior to deducting offering expenses. We used these net proceeds to pay offering expenses and to pay off $40.0 million of the borrowings outstanding under the CS Term Loan, which would otherwise have been required through June 2020.\nThe successor columns below represent the consolidated financial information of Charah Solutions for the year ended December 31, 2018 and the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the predecessor column below represents the financial information of Charah for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGoodwill represents the cost of an acquisition purchase price over the fair value of acquired net assets, and such amounts are reported separately as goodwill on our consolidated and combined balance sheets. Our total goodwill resulted from the application of push-down\u201d accounting associated with BCP's January 2017 acquisition of a controlling equity position in Charah Management and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of SCB.\nGross Profit\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein. This discussion contains forward-looking statements\u201d reflecting our current expectations, estimates, and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position. Actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, economic and competitive conditions, regulatory changes, and other uncertainties, as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere herein. Please read Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements. Also, please read the risk factors and other cautionary statements described under Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere herein. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nByproduct Recycling Market Dynamics\nBased on historic trends, we expect our operating results to vary seasonally. Nuclear power generators perform turnaround and outages in the off-peak months when demand is lower and generation capacity is less constrained. As a result, our nuclear services offerings may have higher revenue volume in the spring and fall months. Variations in normal weather patterns can also cause changes in the consumption of energy, which may influence demand and timing of associated services for our fossil services offerings. Inclement weather can impact construction-related activities associated with pond and landfill remediation, which affects the timing of revenue generation within remediation and compliance services. Byproduct sales are also impacted during winter months when the utilization of cement and cement products is generally lower.\n\nWe analyze our gross profit, which we define as revenues less cost of sales, to measure our financial performance. We believe gross profit is a meaningful metric because it provides insight on financial performance of our revenue streams without consideration of Company overhead. When analyzing gross profit, we compare actual gross profit to our internal projections for a given period and to prior periods to assess our performance.\nOur capital spending consists primarily of equipment costs associated with performance and completion of our contracts, including the replacement of dated and obsolete equipment, and the rollout of technology units that were acquired as part of our acquisition of SCB. However, the amount and timing of these capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer or increase a portion of these planned capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, additional contracts awarded above and beyond our projections, and/or the increase or decrease in the useful life of our equipment. As we pursue growth, we monitor which capital resources, including equity and debt financings, are available to us to meet our future financial obligations, planned capital expenditure activities, and liquidity requirements. Based upon the current industry outlook, we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Syndicated Credit Facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the ability to maintain existing contracts, to obtain new contracts, and to manage our operating expenses. The failure to achieve anticipated revenue and cash flows from operations could result in a reduction in future capital spending. We cannot assure you that operations and other needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all. In the event we make additional acquisitions and the amount of capital required is greater than the amount we have available for acquisitions at that time, we could be required to reduce the expected level of capital expenditures or to seek additional capital. We cannot assure you that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all.\n\u2022A revolving loan not to exceed $50.0 million (the Revolving Loan\u201d);\nKey Factors Affecting Our Business and Financial Statements\nWe are an environmental remediation and maintenance company and conduct our operations through two segments: Environmental Solutions and Maintenance and Technical Services.\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating activities decreased $67.0 million, or 125.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $(13.6) million from $53.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows used in operating activities was primarily attributable to a $21.4 million decrease in net income as explained above, a $73.0 million decrease in cash resulting from the increase in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings primarily related to Brickhaven, a $30.4 million decrease in cash resulting from the decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings, and an $8.4 million increase in accounts receivable, offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization of $23.3 million, an increase in asset retirement obligation of $24.8 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $10.8 million, and an increase in accounts payable of $8.0 million.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nto gross profit but the benefit to Adjusted EBITDA was significantly greater because of the capital-intensive nature of the Brickhaven asset and the acceleration of depreciation. Of the $49 million of depreciation expense related to property, plant, and equipment we recorded in 2018, approximately $38 million was for Brickhaven and related equipment. Had we not had an early completion of the project, depreciation would have been significantly less. We also recorded $15 million of amortization of a purchase option liability related to Brickhaven, which reduced general and administrative expenses. Net of this negative amortization, total depreciation and amortization associated with Brickhaven was $23 million. Because the Riverbend project was completed in March 2019, the amount of revenues and depreciation associated with Brickhaven in 2019 will be substantially lower. Going forward, we expect that cost of goods sold will be more closely aligned with cash costs, consistent with the less capital-intensive nature that is typical of most of our remediation projects.\nOn October 25, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Regions Bank, as administrative agent. The Revolving Credit Agreement provided for a revolving credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d), with a principal amount of up to $45.0 million. The Credit Facility permitted extensions of credit up to the lesser of $45.0 million and a borrowing base that was calculated by us based upon a percentage of the value of our eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory, and approved by the administrative agent.\nThe CS Term Loan had a maturity date of October 25, 2024; however, all amounts outstanding were repaid in September 2018 as a result of the refinancing discussed above.\nThe CS Term Loan contained various representations and warranties, and restrictive covenants. In addition, we were required to comply with a maximum senior secured net leverage ratio of 5.00 to 1.00 beginning March 31, 2018, decreasing to 4.50 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2019, and further decreasing to 4.00 to 1.00 as of March 31, 2020 and thereafter.\nThere is a growing demand for recycled coal ash across a variety of applications, in addition to the market forces and governmental regulations driving the need to dispose of coal ash in an environmentally sensitive manner. Pricing of byproduct sales is driven by supply and demand market dynamics, in addition to the chemical and physical properties of the ash. As demand increases for the end products that use recycled coal-fired power generation waste byproducts (i.e., concrete for construction and infrastructure projects), the demand for recycled coal ash also typically rises. These fluctuations affect the relative demand for our byproduct sales offerings. In recessionary periods, construction and infrastructure spending and the corresponding need for concrete may decline. However, this unfavorable effect may be partially offset by an increase in the demand for recycled coal ash during a recessionary period given coal ash is more cost-effective than other alternatives.\n \u2022 Second, we had an increase of unbilled costs on our balance sheet, shown as costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, or CIE, which reduced operating cash flow by $79 million and thereby resulted in cash flow used in operations of $13.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. As we expect to substantially recover this amount in 2019, these working capital balances will reverse and generate significant cash flow.  Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nDetermining the fair value of these items requires management's judgment and the utilization of independent valuation experts and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions with respect to the timing and amounts of future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, market prices, and asset lives, among other items. The judgments made in the determination of the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, as well as the estimated useful life of each asset and the duration of each liability, can materially impact the consolidated and combined financial statements in periods after acquisition, such as through depreciation and amortization.\nHow We Evaluate Our Operations\n (1) We lease equipment and office facilities under non-cancellable operating leases. \nNet Income (Loss). Net income decreased $8.1 million, or 35.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $15.0 million as compared to $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to the increase in general and administrative expenses noted above, along with an increase in interest expense, net, offset by increases in revenues and gross profit associated with our projects, including the addition of our nuclear services offerings.\nPower Generation Industry Spend on Environmental Liability Management and Regulatory Requirements\n (3) Primary components include a change in charitable giving and other business expense policies associated with the BCP investment. \nOn October 25, 2017, we entered into a credit agreement (the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) by and among us, the lenders party thereto from time to time, and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent, providing for a term loan (the CS Term Loan\u201d) with an initial commitment of $250.0 million. The CS Term Loan provided that we had the right at any time to request incremental term loans up to the greater of (i) the excess, if any, of $25.0 million over the aggregate amount of all incremental Credit Facility commitments and incremental term loan commitments previously utilized, and (ii) such other amount so long as such amount at such time could be incurred without causing the pro forma consolidated secured leverage ratio to exceed 3.25 to 1.00.\n (5) Adjusted EBITDA margin is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenues (which for the year ended December 31, 2016 were less revenues ($5,045) of a non-acquired business line). We use Adjusted EBITDA margin to measure the success of our businesses in managing our cost base and improving profitability. \nThe interest rates per annum applicable to the loans under the Credit Facility were based on a fluctuating rate of interest measured by reference to, at our election, either (i) an adjusted London inter-bank offered rate ( LIBOR\u201d) plus a 2.00% borrowing margin, or (ii) an alternative base rate plus a 1.00% borrowing margin. Customary fees were payable in respect of the Credit\nInterest Expense, Net. Interest expense, net, increased $12.1 million, or 193.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $18.3 million as compared to $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. We incurred $4.1 million of costs associated with debt retirement in conjunction with BCP's investment, which was recorded during the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017. During the period from January 13, 2017 to December 31, 2017, $6.1 million of non-cash debt issuance costs were expensed primarily due to the refinancing of our debt in October 2017. Additionally, we had higher interest costs associated with the increase in our debt balances in 2017.\nWe were formed in January 2018 in anticipation of the IPO to be a holding company for Charah Management and Allied Power Holdings. The historical financial data presented herein as of December 31, 2018 and for periods after the June 18, 2018 corporate reorganization is that of Charah and Allied on a consolidated basis, and on a combined basis for periods prior to the June 18, 2018 corporate reorganization. Allied was formed in May 2017 and did not commence operations until July 2017.\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 Revenues; \nMaintenance and Technical Services Revenues. Maintenance and Technical Services segment revenues increased $143.3 million, or 304.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $190.3 million as compared to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings in the amount of $136.2 million, in addition to the net increase in revenues on fossil services projects of $7.1 million.\nMaintenance and Technical Services Revenues. Maintenance and Technical Services segment revenues increased $207.0 million, or 108.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $397.4 million as compared to $190.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily attributable to the addition of our nuclear services offerings, which did not have a full year of operations in 2017.\n (2) Represents non-recurring startup costs associated with the startup of Allied and our nuclear services offerings, including the setup of financial operations systems and modules, pre-contract expenses to obtain initial contracts, and the hiring of operational staff. Because these costs are associated with the initial setup of the Allied business to initiate the operations involved in our nuclear services offerings, these costs are non-recurring in the normal course of our business. \nWe have entered into various equipment financing arrangements to finance the acquisition of certain equipment (the Equipment Financing Facilities\u201d). As of December 31, 2018, we had equipment lines of credit allowing borrowings of $22.0 million, of which $17.9 million was utilized. In addition, we had $17.2 million of equipment notes outstanding as of December 31, 2018. Each of the Equipment Financing Facilities include non-financial covenants, and, as of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nPlease see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\u201d and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies-Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our historical consolidated and combined financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, included elsewhere herein, for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements.\nThe table below sets forth our selected operating data for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. The successor column below represents the combined financial information of Charah and Allied for the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and the predecessor columns below represent the financial information of Charah for the year ended December 31, 2016 and the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017, each as reflected in our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein. The dollar amount and percentage change information below reflects the difference between the combined results for the period from January 1, 2017 through January 12, 2017 and the period from January 13, 2017 through December 31, 2017, and the results for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities increased $43.5 million, or 293.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $28.6 million from $(14.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the $59.2 million in proceeds from the issuance of our common stock, which was used to make $40.0 million of principal payments towards our term loan and also pay $8.9 million of costs associated with the IPO.

growth in both the Environmental Solutions and Maintenance & Technical Services segments. The increase was attributable to factors like the addition of nuclear services, acquisition of SCB, and early completion of the Brickhaven contract.\n\n- Gross profit also increased in 2018 compared to 2017, but at a lower rate than revenue growth. As a result, gross margin decreased from 19.6% in 2017 to 13.2% in 2018. \n\n- Net income decreased significantly in 2018 compared to 2017, due to higher general & administrative expenses, higher interest expense, and other factors. \n\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 29.9% in 2018 compared to 2017, but Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 18.1% to 13.3% due to factors impacting gross margin.\n\n- The early completion of the Brickhaven contract had a significant impact on 2018 results, accelerating revenues but also accelerating depreciation expense. This increased Adjusted EBITDA but reduced net income and cash flow.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was negative in 2018 compared to positive in 2017, largely due to working capital timing impacts of the Brickhaven contract completion. \n\n- Higher capital expenditures and debt repayments also impacted cash flow changes between 2018 and 2017.\n\nIn summary, the report shows strong revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth but with margin compression. Net income, cash flow, and other metrics were negatively impacted by the Brickhaven contract timing but are expected to improve in 2019. Overall it provides insight into the company's 2018 transitional year and growth strategies."}
