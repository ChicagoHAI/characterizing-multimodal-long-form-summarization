meaningful.\nNet income attributable to BHE shareholders increased $3,993 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized loss in 2019 of $313 million ($227 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2020 was $3,473 million, an increase of $296 million, or 9%, compared to adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2019 of $3,177 million.\nThe increase in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:\n\u2022$50 million higher net income at the Utilities with favorable performance at all four utilities (actual retail customer sales volumes increased 74 GWhs, or 0.1%), including $193 million of higher PTCs recognized, offset by a comparative increase in wildfire and other storm restoration costs, primarily at PacifiCorp;\n\u2022$106 million higher net income at BHE Pipeline Group, primarily due to $73 million of incremental net income from the GT&S Transaction and a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas;\n\u2022$55 million lower net income at Northern Powergrid, mainly due to a deferred income tax charge in 2020 from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\n\u2022$90 million higher net income at BHE Renewables, primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, offset by lower earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities;\n\u2022$215 million higher net income at HomeServices, primarily due to higher earnings from mortgage services (71% increase in funded mortgage volume) and brokerage services (13% increase in closed transaction volume) largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment; and\n\u2022$3,585 higher net income at BHE and Other due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nNet income attributable to BHE shareholders increased $382 million for 2019 compared to 2018. Included in these results were pre-tax unrealized losses on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited ($313 million, $227 million after-tax, in 2019 and $526 million, $383 million after-tax, in 2018) and a $134 million income tax benefit in 2018 related to the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings as a result of 2017 Tax Reform. Excluding the impacts of these items, adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2019 was $3,177 million, an increase of $360 million, or 13%, compared to adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2018 of $2,817 million.\nThe increase in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:\n\u2022$194 million higher net income at the Utilities with favorable performance at all four utilities (actual retail customer sales volumes increased 74 GWhs, or 0.1%), including $49 million of higher PTCs recognized;\n\u2022$35 million higher net income at BHE Pipeline Group, primarily due to higher transportation revenue; and\n\u2022$102 million higher net income at BHE Renewables, primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind projects, including increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments largely from projects reaching commercial operation, and higher earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities.\nReportable Segment Results\nPacifiCorp\nOperating revenue increased $273 million for 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher retail revenue of $250 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $23 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to $234 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain property, plant and equipment and the accelerated amortization of certain regulatory asset balances in relation to Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in December 2020. The increase in retail revenue was also due to price impacts of $49 million from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower customer volumes of $34 million. The increase in wholesale and other revenue was mainly due to $34 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances in Oregon to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain retired wind equipment, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nNet income decreased $32 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance expense due to higher costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement of $169 million, higher interest expense of $25 million from higher long-term debt balances, higher pension and other postretirement costs of $13 million, lower interest income from lower average interest rates and higher property taxes of $10 million, partially offset by lower tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $62 million from repowered and new wind-powered generating facilities, higher utility margin of $47 million and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $38 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs, lower purchased power costs and price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms and lower retail customer volumes.\nOperating revenue increased $42 million for 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher retail revenue of $40 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $2 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer volumes of $31 million and higher average retail rates of $9 million. Retail customer volumes increased 0.4% primarily due to an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather, partially offset by lower customer usage. Wholesale and other revenue increased primarily due to higher wholesale average market prices, largely offset by lower wholesale volumes.\nNet income increased $34 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $55 million, lower pension and post retirement expense of $11 million and higher utility margin of $4 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $25 million from additional plant placed in-service, lower PTCs of $21 million from expirations, higher interest expense of $17 million and higher operations and maintenance expense of $10 million, primarily due to costs associated with the early retirement of a coal-fueled generation unit totaling $24 million offset by a decrease in wildfire suppression costs of $9 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled generation costs, higher wholesale average market prices, higher retail revenue primarily due to favorable customer volumes and higher net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes, higher purchased electricity costs, higher natural gas-fueled generation costs and lower net wheeling revenue.\nMidAmerican Funding\nOperating revenue decreased $199 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas operating revenue of $77 million, lower electric operating revenue of $70 million, lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $38 million (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower other revenue of $14 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services. Natural gas operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower volumes and a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in lower purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $68 million (offset in cost of sales) and a 10.2% decrease in retail customer volumes, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower wholesale and other revenue of $88 million, partially offset by higher retail revenue of $18 million. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased mainly due to lower average wholesale per-unit prices of $115 million, partially offset by higher wholesale volumes of $28 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer usage of $38 million, partially offset by price impacts of $18 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.2% due to increased usage for certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower commercial and industrial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nNet income increased $37 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $197 million from higher PTCs recognized of $132 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $77 million due to additional assets placed in-service (offset by $23 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals), lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $45 million, higher interest expense of $20 million and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. PTCs recognized increased due to higher wind-powered generation driven primarily by repowering and new wind projects placed in-service. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower wholesale revenue and the price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower generation costs from higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes. Natural gas utility margin decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather.\nOperating revenue decreased $126 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $76 million (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower natural gas operating revenue of $66 million, partially offset by higher other operating revenue of $13 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services, and higher electric operating revenue of $3 million. Electric operating revenue increased due to higher retail revenue of $77 million, partially offset by lower wholesale and other revenue of $74 million. Electric retail revenue increased due to higher customer usage of $76 million and higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of fuel and energy, operations and maintenance expense and income tax expense), primarily the energy adjustment clause, partially offset by lower average rates of $54 million due to sales mix and $19 million from the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.4% as an increase in industrial volumes of 4.0% was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impact of weather and lower customer usage. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased due to 10.6% lower sales volumes and $35 million from lower average per-unit prices. Natural gas operating revenue decreased from lower recoveries through the purchased gas adjustment clause due to a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold totaling $69 million (offset in cost of sales), partially offset by an increase in retail sales volumes of 2.0% from the favorable impact of weather in 2019.\nNet income increased $112 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $115 million, largely due to higher PTCs of $70 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, higher electric utility margin, higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds of $32 million and higher investment earnings, partially offset by higher interest expense of $55 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $30 million due to additional assets placed in-service offset by $46 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals. Electric utility margin increased due to lower generation costs from higher wind generation, higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of fuel and energy, operations and maintenance expense and income tax expense) and higher retail customer volumes.\nNV Energy\nOperating revenue decreased $183 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue. Electric operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower fully-bundled energy rates (offset in cost of sales) of $164 million and a $120 million one-time bill credit given to customers in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses), partially offset by higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, largely offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial, distribution only service and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nNet income increased $45 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $100 million, lower pension and post-retirement costs of $9 million and lower income tax expense mainly from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expense, mainly from higher earnings sharing accruals at the Nevada Utilities, and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $20 million, mainly from higher plant placed in-service. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision.\nOperating revenue decreased $2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue of $17 million, partially offset by higher natural gas operating revenue of $15 million. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower retail revenue of $32 million, partially offset by higher wholesale and other revenue of $15 million. Electric retail revenue decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes of $50 million and a decrease from a tax rate reduction rider effective April 2018 of $17 million, partially offset by higher fully-bundled energy rates (offset in cost of sales) of $31 million and an increase in the average number of customers of $9 million. Electric retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of weather, net of increased distribution only service customer volumes. Natural gas operating revenue increased due to a higher average per-unit price (offset in cost of sales) of $13 million and higher volumes from the impacts of weather.\nNet income increased $48 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expense, largely due to lower political activity expenses and lower earnings sharing accruals of $23 million at Nevada Power, partially offset by lower electric utility margin of $58 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower retail customer volumes and lower average retail rates from a tax rate reduction rider, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers and higher wholesale and transmission revenue.\nNorthern Powergrid\nOperating revenue increased $9 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $10 million from increased tariff rates of $40 million, partially offset by 5.4% lower units distributed of $30 million largely due to the impacts of COVID-19. Net income decreased $55 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to write-offs of gas exploration costs of $44 million, higher income tax expense of $37 million and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $18 million, partially offset by the higher distribution revenue, lower overall pension expense of $22 million, including lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2020 compared to 2019, and lower interest expense of $9 million. The increase in income tax expense is due to a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate that resulted in a deferred income tax charge of $35 million.\nOperating revenue decreased $7 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the stronger United States dollar of $45 million and lower distributed units of $21 million, partially offset by higher distribution tariff rates of $39 million and higher smart meter revenue of $15 million due to a larger number of units installed. Net income increased $17 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower overall pension expense of $23 million, largely resulting from lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, and the higher distribution revenues, partially offset by higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $13 million and the stronger United States dollar of $10 million.\nBHE Pipeline Group\nOperating revenue increased $447 million for 2020 compared to 2019 due to $331 million of incremental revenue from the GT&S Transaction, a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $101 million and higher transportation revenue of $43 million, partially offset by lower gas sales at Northern Natural Gas of $23 million related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales). Net income increased $106 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $73 million of incremental net income from the GT&S Transaction, the higher transportation revenue, and a favorable after-tax, rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $32 million, partially offset by higher property and other tax expense of $17 million, including a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million due to increased spending on capital projects and lower interest income of $9 million.\nOperating revenue decreased $72 million for 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower gas sales of $89 million at Northern Natural Gas related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales), partially offset by higher transportation revenue of $19 million. Transportation revenue increased from generally higher volumes and rates, partially offset by the impact of period two rates of $26 million (largely offset in depreciation and amortization expense) and $11 million from refunds related to 2017 Tax Reform at Kern River. Net income increased $35 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the higher transportation revenue, excluding the impact of period two rates, lower property and other tax expense of $9 million due to a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019 and favorable margin of $9 million on system balancing activities, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, net of the impact of lower depreciation rates at Kern River, due to increased spending on capital projects.\nBHE Transmission\nOperating revenue decreased $48 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and the stronger United States dollar of $7 million. Net income increased $2 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada and higher net income at BHE U.S. Transmission of $6 million mainly due to improved equity earnings from ETT, partially offset by the impacts of regulatory decisions received in 2020 and 2019 at AltaLink.\nOperating revenue decreased $3 million for 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to the stronger United States dollar of $17 million, largely offset by favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 at AltaLink. Net income increased $19 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink and higher equity earnings at ETT, partially offset by the stronger United States dollar impact of $5 million.\nBHE Renewables\nOperating revenue increased $4 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar and hydro revenues of $21 million due to favorable generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $14 million and lower geothermal revenues of $4 million from lower pricing. Net income increased $90 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to favorable wind tax equity investment earnings of $129 million, partially offset by lower geothermal earnings of $22 million, due to higher operations and maintenance expense and lower pricing, and lower natural gas earnings of $17 million, due to lower margins. Wind tax equity investment earnings improved due to $147 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower commitment fee income of $15 million and lower earnings from existing tax equity investments of $6 million.\nOperating revenue increased $24 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher wind revenues of $32 million and higher natural gas and geothermal revenues of $32 million due to higher generation and pricing from market opportunities, partially offset by lower hydro revenues of $28 million due to lower rainfall and lower solar revenues of $11 million due to lower insolation. Wind revenues increased primarily due to $33 million from new projects and a favorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $11 million, partially offset by lower generation of $12 million at existing projects. Net income increased $102 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher wind earnings of $74 million and higher geothermal earnings of $53 million, largely due to higher generation and margins from market opportunities and lower operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by lower hydro earnings of $20 million, primarily due to lower rainfall and a declining financial asset balance, and lower solar earnings of $5 million primarily due to lower insolation. Wind earnings were favorable primarily due to improved tax equity investment earnings of $49 million, earnings from new projects of $35 million and a favorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $11 million, partially offset by lower revenues on existing projects of $12 million, primarily from lower generation, and $8 million of unfavorable changes in the valuation of interest rate swap derivatives. Tax equity investment earnings were favorable due to $57 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation and $7 million of higher commitment fee income, partially offset by $13 million of lower earnings from existing projects mainly due to lower generation caused by turbine blade repairs.\nHomeServices\nOperating revenue increased $923 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $440 million from a 13% increase in closed transaction volume and higher mortgage revenue of $423 million from a 71% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment. Net income increased $215 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage services of $138 million and higher earnings at brokerage services largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment.\nOperating revenue increased $259 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase from acquired businesses of $221 million and higher mortgage revenue at existing businesses of $103 million from a 32% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity, partially offset by lower brokerage revenue at existing businesses of $74 million mainly due to a 1% decrease in closed transaction volume. Net income increased $15 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher earnings at existing mortgage businesses of $33 million due to an increase in refinance activity and net income from acquired businesses of $9 million, partially offset by $36 million of lower earnings at existing brokerage businesses primarily from lower closed volume and margins.\nBHE and Other\nOperating revenue decreased $118 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas volumes at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC. Net income increased $3,585 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited of $3,697 million, partially offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nOperating revenue decreased $58 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas volumes at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC. Net loss remained the same for 2019 compared to 2018 as the change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited of $156 million was offset by a $134 million income tax benefit recognized in 2018 related to the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, higher BHE corporate interest expense and lower net income of $14 million at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC driven by unrealized mark-to-market losses on contracts.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nEach of BHE's direct and indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from BHE and its other subsidiaries. It should not be assumed that the assets of any subsidiary will be available to satisfy BHE's obligations or the obligations of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law, regulatory commitments and the terms of financing and ring-fencing arrangements for such parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to BHE or affiliates thereof. The Company's long-term debt may include provisions that allow BHE or its subsidiaries to redeem such debt in whole or in part at any time. These provisions generally include make-whole premiums. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the limitation of distributions from BHE's subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31,

9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Company's credit facilities, letters of credit, equity commitments and other related items.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6,224 million and $6,206 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income tax receipts and improved operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in income tax receipts.\nThe timing of the Company's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods and assumptions for each payment date.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(13.2) billion and $(9.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions and higher funding of tax equity investments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $599 million. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $(9.0) billion and $(7.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $1.1 billion and higher funding of tax equity investments. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nNatural Gas Transmission and Storage Business Acquisition\nOn November 1, 2020, BHE completed its acquisition of substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage business of DEI and Dominion Questar, exclusive of the Questar Pipeline Group (the \"GT&S Transaction\"). Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 3, 2020 (the \"GT&S Purchase Agreement\"), BHE paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash, after post-closing adjustments (the \"GT&S Cash Consideration\"), and assumed approximately $5.6 billion of existing indebtedness for borrowed money, including fair value adjustments.\nOn October 5, 2020, DEI and Dominion Questar, as permitted under the terms of the GT&S Purchase Agreement, delivered notice to BHE of their election to terminate the GT&S Transaction with respect to the Questar Pipeline Group and, in connection with the execution of the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement referenced below, to waive the related termination fee under the GT&S Purchase Agreement. Also on October 5, 2020, BHE entered into a second Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \"Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement\") with Dominion Questar providing for BHE's purchase of the Questar Pipeline Group from Dominion Questar (the \"Q-Pipe Transaction\") after receipt of HSR Approval, which is currently anticipated in the first half of 2021, for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion (the \"Q-Pipe Cash Consideration\"), subject to adjustment for cash and indebtedness as of the closing, and the assumption of approximately $430 million of existing indebtedness for borrowed money. Under the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement, BHE delivered the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration of approximately $1.3 billion to Dominion Questar on November 2, 2020.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.1 billion. Sources of cash totaled $11.7 billion and consisted of proceeds from BHE senior debt issuances of $5.2 billion, proceeds from preferred stock issuances of $3.8 billion and proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $2.7 billion. Uses of cash totaled $4.5 billion and consisted mainly of $2.8 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt, net repayments of short term debt of $939 million and $350 million for repayments of BHE senior debt.\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.1 billion. Sources of cash totaled $5.4 billion and consisted of proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $4.7 billion and net proceeds from short-term debt of $684 million. Uses of cash totaled $2.3 billion and consisted mainly of $1.9 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt and repurchases of common stock of $293 million.\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $(174) million. Sources of cash totaled $5.6 billion and consisted of proceeds from BHE senior debt issuances of $3.2 billion and proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $2.4 billion. Uses of cash totaled $5.8 billion and consisted mainly of $2.4 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt, net repayments of short term debt of $1.9 billion, $1.0 billion for repayments of BHE senior debt and the purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest of $131 million.\nDebt Repurchases\nThe Company may from time to time seek to acquire its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any debt securities repurchased by the Company may be reissued or resold by the Company from time to time and will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nPreferred Stock Issuance\nOn October 29, 2020, BHE issued $3.75 billion of its 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock to certain subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in order to fund the GT&S Cash Consideration and the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration.\nCommon Stock Transactions\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, BHE repurchased 180,358 shares of its common stock for $126 million, 447,712 shares of its common stock for $293 million and 177,381 shares of its common stock for $107 million, respectively.\nFuture Uses of Cash\nThe Company has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, the issuance of equity and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which BHE and each subsidiary has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, its credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry and project finance markets, among other items.\nCapital Expenditures\nThe Company has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customers' rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisitions of existing assets.\nThe Company's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity

Wind XI, a 2,000-MW project, was completed in January 2020. Wind XII, a 592-MW project, was placed in-service in 2019 and 2020. MidAmerican Energy had three other wind-powered generation projects under construction in 2020 that totaled 319 MWs, including facilities placed in-service in 2020 and the remainder expected to be placed in-service in early 2021. MidAmerican Energy expects all of these wind-powered generating facilities to qualify for 100% of PTCs available. PTCs from these projects are excluded from MidAmerican Energy's Iowa energy adjustment clause until these generation assets are reflected in base rates.\n\u25e6MidAmerican Energy is currently planning to construct 483 MWs of additional wind-powered generating facilities, for which the related projects are at varying stages of development. Planned spending for those projects totals $461 million for 2021, $16 million for 2022 and $421 million for 2023.\n\u25e6Repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $37 million for 2020, $369 million for 2019 and $422 million for 2018. The repowering projects entail the replacement of significant components of older turbines. Planned spending for the repowered generating facilities totals $409 million in 2021 and $673 million in 2022. Of the 1,079 MWs of current repowering projects not in-service as of December 31, 2020, 80 MWs are currently expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years following each facility's return to service, 592 MWs are expected to qualify for 80% of such credits and 407 MWs are expected to qualify for 60% of such credits.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $1,148 million for 2020, $338 million for 2019 and $9 million for 2018 and includes 674 MWs of new wind-powered generating facilities that were placed in-service in 2020 and 516 MWs expected to be placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the new wind-powered generating facilities totals $43 million in 2021 and $533 million in 2023. The energy production from the new wind-powered generating facilities is expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years once the equipment is placed in-service.\n\u25e6Repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $125 million for 2020, $585 million for 2019 and $332 million for 2018. The repowering projects entail the replacement of significant components of older turbines. Certain repowering projects were placed in service in 2019 and 2020 and the remaining repowering projects are expected to be placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the repowered generating facilities totals $42 million in 2021, $19 million in 2022 and $64 million in 2023. The energy production from such repowered facilities is expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years following each facility's return to service.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at BHE Renewables totaling $15 million for 2019 and $717 million for 2018. BHE Renewables placed in-service 512 MWs during 2018.\n\u2022Electric distribution includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include new customer connections and enhancements to existing customer connections. Operating expenditures include ongoing distribution systems infrastructure needed at the Utilities and Northern Powergrid, wildfire mitigation, damage restoration and storm damage repairs and investments in routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Electric transmission includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include PacifiCorp's costs for the 140-mile 500-kV Aeolus-Bridger/Anticline transmission line, which is a major segment of PacifiCorp's Energy Gateway Transmission expansion program placed in-service in November 2020, the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program and AltaLink's directly assigned projects from the AESO. Operating expenditures include system reinforcement and investments in routine expenditures for transmission needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u2022Natural gas transmission and storage includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures includes, among other items, the Northern Natural Gas New Lisbon Expansion and Twin Cities Area Expansion projects. Operating expenditures include, among other items, asset modernization and pipeline integrity projects.\n\u2022Solar generation includes growth expenditures, including MidAmerican Energy's current plan to construct 767 MWs of small- and utility-scale solar generation, for which the related projects are in varying stages of development. Nevada Power's solar generation investment includes expenditures for a 150 MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 100 MW capacity of co-located battery storage, known as the Dry Lake generating facility. Commercial operation at Dry Lake is expected by the end of 2023.\n\u2022Other capital expenditures includes both growth and operating expenditures, including routine expenditures for generation and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand, natural gas distribution, technology, and environmental spending relating to emissions control equipment and the management of CCR.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has contractual cash obligations that may affect its consolidated financial condition. The following table summarizes the Company's material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Periods </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022- </td> <td> </td> <td>2024- </td> <td> </td> <td>2026 and </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>After </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHE senior debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,551 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHE junior subordinated debentures </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subsidiary debt </td> <td> </td> <td>1,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,108 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,587 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Short-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>2,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and finance lease liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,081 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on operating and finance lease liabilities(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>618 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fuel, capacity and transmission contract commitments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,985 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,305 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction commitments(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Easements(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,595 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual cash obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,871 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,287 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,715 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company has other types of commitments that arise primarily from unused lines of credit, letters of credit or relate to construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7 and Note 9), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 12) and AROs (refer to Note 14), which have not been included in the above table because the amount and timing of the cash payments are not certain. Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nAdditionally, the Company has invested in projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Under the terms of these tax equity investments, the Company has entered into equity capital contribution agreements with the project sponsors that require contributions. The Company has made contributions of $2,736 million, $1,619 million and $698 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and has commitments as of December 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, to provide equity contributions of $563 million in 2021 pursuant to these equity capital contribution agreements as the various projects achieve commercial operation. Once a project achieves commercial operation, the Company enters into a partnership agreement with the project sponsor that directs and allocates the operating profits and tax benefits from the project.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters.\nCOVID-19\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic and containment and mitigation measures were recommended worldwide, which has had an unprecedented impact on society in general and many of the customers served by the Company. While COVID-19 has impacted the Company's financial results and operations through December 31, 2020, the impacts have not been material. However, more severe impacts may still occur that could adversely affect future financial results depending on the duration and extent of COVID-19. Most jurisdictions in which the Company operates have moved to varying phases of recovery plans with most businesses opening subject to certain operating restrictions. As the impacts of COVID-19 and related customer and governmental responses remain uncertain, including the duration of restrictions on business openings, reductions in the consumption of electricity or natural gas may continue to occur, particularly in the commercial and industrial classes. Due to regulatory requirements and voluntary actions taken by the Utilities and Northern Powergrid related to customer collection activity and suspension of disconnections for non-payment, the Utilities and Northern Powergrid have seen delays and reductions in cash receipts from retail customers related to the impacts of COVID-19, which could result in higher than normal bad debt write-offs. The amount of such reductions in cash receipts through December 2020 has not been material compared to the same period in 2019, but uncertainty remains. Regulatory jurisdictions may allow for the deferral or recovery of certain costs incurred in responding to COVID-19. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Residential property transactions may also decline in the future at HomeServices due to the varying phases of state recovery plans and associated duration of restrictions on business openings, other measures and general economic uncertainty.\nSeveral of the Company's businesses have been deemed essential and their employees have been identified as \"critical infrastructure employees\" allowing them to move within communities and across jurisdictional boundaries as necessary to maintain the electric generation, transmission and distribution systems and the natural gas transportation and distribution systems. In response to the effects of COVID-19, the Company has implemented various business continuity plans to protect its employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, including situational use of personal protective equipment by employees when interacting with customers and implementing practices to enhance social distancing at the workplace. Such practices have included work-from-home, staggered work schedules, rotational work location assignments, increased cleaning and sanitation of work spaces and providing general health reminders intended to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nQuad Cities Generating Station Operating Status\nExelon Generation Company, LLC (\"Exelon Generation\"), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 (\"Quad Cities Station\") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25% ownership interest, announced on June 2, 2016, its intention to shut down Quad Cities Station on June 1, 2018. In December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs will provide Exelon Generation additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy will not receive additional revenue from the subsidy.\nThe PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (\"PJM\") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule (\"MOPR\"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a government-provided financial support program, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. An expanded PJM MOPR to include existing resources would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of Quad Cities Station not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions.\nOn December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expands the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which is effective as of the PJM's next capacity auction. While the FERC included some limited exemptions in its order, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement (\"FRR\") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. In response to the FERC's order, the PJM submitted a compliance filing on March 18, 2020, wherein the PJM proposes tariff language reflecting the FERC's directives and a schedule for resuming capacity auctions. On April 16, 2020, the FERC issued an order largely denying requests for rehearing of the FERC's December 2019 order but granting a few clarifications that required an additional PJM compliance filing, which it submitted on June 1, 2020. On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing of its April 16, 2020 order and accepting the PJM's two compliance filings, subject to a further compliance filing to revise minor aspects of the proposed MOPR methodology. As part of that order, the FERC also accepted the PJM's proposal to condense the schedule of activities leading up to the next capacity auction but did not specify when that schedule would commence given that a key element of the MOPR level computation remains pending before the FERC in another proceeding. In November 2020, the PJM announced that the next capacity auction will be conducted in May 2021.\nOn May 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order involving reforms to the PJM's day-ahead and real-time reserves markets that need to be reflected in the calculation of MOPR levels. In approving reforms to the PJM's reserves markets, the FERC also directed the PJM to develop a new methodology for estimating revenues that resources will receive for sales of energy and related services, which will then be used in calculating a number of parameters and assumptions used in the capacity market, including MOPR levels. The PJM submitted its new revenue projection methodology on August 5, 2020. On review of this compliance filing, the FERC is expected to address how these additional reforms will impact MOPR levels, the timeline for implementing the new revenue projection methodology, and the timing for commencing the capacity auction schedule.\nExelon Generation is currently working with PJM and other stakeholders to pursue the FRR option as an alternative to the next PJM capacity auction. If Illinois implements the FRR option, Quad Cities Station could be removed from PJM's capacity auction and instead supply capacity and be compensated under the FRR program. If Illinois cannot implement an FRR program in its PJM zones, then the MOPR will apply to Quad Cities Station, resulting in higher offers for its units that may not clear the capacity market. Implementing the FRR program in Illinois will require both legislative and regulatory changes. MidAmerican Energy cannot predict whether or when such legislative and regulatory changes can be implemented or their potential impact on the continued operation of Quad Cities Station.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, RPS, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and capital expenditure requirements, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Refer to \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations.\nCollateral and Contingent Features\nDebt of BHE and debt and preferred securities of certain of its subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of the rated company's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time.\nBHE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities.\nIn accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels (\"credit-risk-related contingent features\") or provide the right for counterparties to demand \"adequate assurance,\" or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable entities' credit ratings from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2020, the Company would have been required to post $307 million of additional collateral. The Company's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors.\nInflation\nHistorically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where BHE's subsidiaries operate have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. In the United States and Canada, the Regulated Businesses operate under cost-of-service based rate structures administered by various state and provincial commissions and the FERC. Under these rate structures, the Regulated Businesses are allowed to include prudent costs in their rates, including the impact of inflation. The price control formula used by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies incorporates the rate of inflation in determining rates charged to customers. BHE's subsidiaries attempt to minimize the potential impact of inflation on their operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, an amount is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. Certain equity investments are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of investment tax credits.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of $2.7 billion, unused revolving credit facilities of $173 million and letters of credit outstanding of $88 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was $1.3 billion, unused revolving credit facilities was $87 million and outstanding letters of credit was $43 million. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facilities is non-recourse to the Company. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding letters of credit is recourse to the Company. Although the Company is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCertain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by the Company's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nAccounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\nThe Regulated Businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, the Regulated Businesses defer the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur.\nThe Company continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit the Regulated Businesses' ability to recover their costs. The Company believes the application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal, state and provincial levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were $3.4 billion and total regulatory liabilities were $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Regulated Businesses' regulatory assets and liabilities.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $11.5 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2020. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. The Company uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings or rate base; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, the Company incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors. Refer to Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's goodwill.\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment was used in regulated businesses as of December 31, 2020, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets.\nThe estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what the Company would expect to recover from the future use of the asset. Changes in judgment that could significantly alter the calculation of the fair value or the recoverable amount of the asset may result from significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset or the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect the Company's results of operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a net liability totaling $138 million for the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2020, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in net regulatory assets totaled $604 million and in AOCI totaled $655 million.\nThe expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced.\nIn establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate.\nThe Company chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00% by 2025, at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant.

The Company's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of the Company's federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations is uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.\nIt is probable the Company's regulated businesses will pass income tax benefits and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35% to 21% as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2020, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of $3.3 billion and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse.\nThe Company has not established deferred income taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings that have been determined by management to be reinvested indefinitely; however, the Company periodically evaluates its capital requirements. If circumstances change in the future and a portion of the Company's undistributed foreign earnings were repatriated, the dividends may be subject to taxation in the United States but the tax is not expected to be material.\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue\nRevenue recognized is equal to what the Company has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The determination of customer invoices is based on a systematic reading of meters, fixed reservation charges based on contractual quantities and rates or, in the case of the Great Britain distribution businesses, when information is received from the national settlement system. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was $750 million as of December 31, 2020. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings.", "item_7_truncated": "\n\u2022$90 million higher net income at BHE Renewables, primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, offset by lower earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities;\nOperating revenue decreased $118 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas volumes at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC.

of $32 million due to higher generation and pricing from market opportunities, partially offset by lower hydro revenues of $28 million due to lower rainfall and lower solar revenues of $11 million due to lower insolation. Wind revenues increased primarily due to $33 million from new projects and a favorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $11 million, partially offset by lower generation of $12 million at existing projects. Net income increased $102 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher wind earnings of $74 million and higher geothermal earnings of $53 million, largely due to higher generation and margins from market opportunities and lower operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by lower hydro earnings of $20 million, primarily due to lower rainfall and a declining financial asset balance, and lower solar earnings of $5 million primarily due to lower insolation. Wind earnings were favorable primarily due to improved tax equity investment earnings of $49 million, earnings from new projects of $35 million and a favorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $11 million, partially offset by lower revenues on existing projects of $12 million, primarily from lower generation, and $8 million of unfavorable changes in the valuation of interest rate swap derivatives. Tax equity investment earnings were favorable due to $57 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation and $7 million of higher commitment fee income, partially offset by $13 million of lower earnings from existing projects mainly due to lower generation caused by turbine blade repairs.\nThe Company continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit the Regulated Businesses' ability to recover their costs. The Company believes the application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal, state and provincial levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were $3.4 billion and total regulatory liabilities were $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Regulated Businesses' regulatory assets and liabilities.\nOperating revenue decreased $3 million for 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to the stronger United States dollar of $17 million, largely offset by favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 at AltaLink. Net income increased $19 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink and higher equity earnings at ETT, partially offset by the stronger United States dollar impact of $5 million.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Historical </td> <td> </td> <td>Forecast </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PacifiCorp </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MidAmerican Funding </td> <td>2,332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,101 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,036 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NV Energy </td> <td>503 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>742 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,001 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>980 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Northern Powergrid </td> <td>566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHE Pipeline Group </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>659 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHE Transmission </td> <td>270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHE Renewables </td> <td>817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HomeServices </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>BHE and Other(1)\n</td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(130) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,765 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company has not established deferred income taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings that have been determined by management to be reinvested indefinitely; however, the Company periodically evaluates its capital requirements.

efficiency program revenue of $76 million (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower natural gas operating revenue of $66 million, partially offset by higher other operating revenue of $13 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services, and higher electric operating revenue of $3 million. Electric operating revenue increased due to higher retail revenue of $77 million, partially offset by lower wholesale and other revenue of $74 million. Electric retail revenue increased due to higher customer usage of $76 million and higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of fuel and energy, operations and maintenance expense and income tax expense), primarily the energy adjustment clause, partially offset by lower average rates of $54 million due to sales mix and $19 million from the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.4% as an increase in industrial volumes of 4.0% was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impact of weather and lower customer usage. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased due to 10.6% lower sales volumes and $35 million from lower average per-unit prices. Natural gas operating revenue decreased from lower recoveries through the purchased gas adjustment clause due to a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold totaling $69 million (offset in cost of sales), partially offset by an increase in retail sales volumes of 2.0% from the favorable impact of weather in 2019.\n\u2022$106 million higher net income at BHE Pipeline Group, primarily due to $73 million of incremental net income from the GT&S Transaction and a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas;\nIn establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate.\nCertain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by the Company's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn May 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order involving reforms to the PJM's day-ahead and real-time reserves markets that need to be reflected in the calculation of MOPR levels. In approving reforms to the PJM's reserves markets, the FERC also directed the PJM to develop a new methodology for estimating revenues that resources will receive for sales of energy and related services, which will then be used in calculating a number of parameters and assumptions used in the capacity market, including MOPR levels. The PJM submitted its new revenue projection methodology on August 5, 2020. On review of this compliance filing, the FERC is expected to address how these additional reforms will impact MOPR levels, the timeline for implementing the new revenue projection methodology, and the timing for commencing the capacity auction schedule.\nResults of Operations\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic and containment and mitigation measures were recommended worldwide, which has had an unprecedented impact on society in general and many of the customers served by the Company. While COVID-19 has impacted the Company's financial results and operations through December 31, 2020, the impacts have not been material. However, more severe impacts may still occur that could adversely affect future financial results depending on the duration and extent of COVID-19. Most jurisdictions in which the Company operates have moved to varying phases of recovery plans with most businesses opening subject to certain operating restrictions. As the impacts of COVID-19 and related customer and governmental responses remain uncertain, including the duration of restrictions on business openings, reductions in the consumption of electricity or natural gas may continue to occur, particularly in the commercial and industrial classes. Due to regulatory requirements and voluntary actions taken by the Utilities and Northern Powergrid related to customer collection activity and suspension of disconnections for non-payment, the Utilities and Northern Powergrid have seen delays and reductions in cash receipts from retail customers related to the impacts of COVID-19, which could result in higher than normal bad debt write-offs. The amount of such reductions in cash receipts through December 2020 has not been material compared to the same period in 2019, but uncertainty remains. Regulatory jurisdictions may allow for the deferral or recovery of certain costs incurred in responding to COVID-19. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Residential property transactions may also decline in the future at HomeServices due to the varying phases of state recovery plans and associated duration of restrictions on business openings, other measures and general economic uncertainty.\nOperating revenue increased $4 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar and hydro revenues of $21 million due to favorable generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $14 million and lower geothermal revenues of $4 million from lower pricing. Net income increased $90 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to favorable wind tax equity investment earnings of $129 million, partially offset by lower geothermal earnings of $22 million, due to higher operations and maintenance expense and lower pricing, and lower natural gas earnings of $17 million, due to lower margins. Wind tax equity investment earnings improved due to $147 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower commitment fee income of $15 million and lower earnings from existing tax equity investments of $6 million.\nNet income increased $112 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $115 million, largely due to higher PTCs of $70 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, higher electric utility margin, higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds of $32 million and higher investment earnings, partially offset by higher interest expense of $55 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $30 million due to additional assets placed in-service offset by $46 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals. Electric utility margin increased due to lower generation costs from higher wind generation, higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of fuel and energy, operations and maintenance expense and income tax expense) and higher retail customer volumes.\nNet income increased $48 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expense, largely due to lower political activity expenses and lower earnings sharing accruals of $23 million at Nevada Power, partially offset by lower electric utility margin of $58 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower retail customer volumes and lower average retail rates from a tax rate reduction rider, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers and higher wholesale and transmission revenue.\nQuad Cities Generating Station Operating Status\nOperating revenue decreased $199 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas operating revenue of $77 million, lower electric operating revenue of $70 million, lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $38 million (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower other revenue of $14 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services. Natural gas operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower volumes and a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in lower purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $68 million (offset in cost of sales) and a 10.2% decrease in retail customer volumes, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower wholesale and other revenue of $88 million, partially offset by higher retail revenue of $18 million. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased mainly due to lower average wholesale per-unit prices of $115 million, partially offset by higher wholesale volumes of $28 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer usage of $38 million, partially offset by price impacts of $18 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.2% due to increased usage for certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower commercial and industrial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\n\u25e6Repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $125 million for 2020, $585 million for 2019 and $332 million for 2018. The repowering projects entail the replacement of significant components of older turbines. Certain repowering projects were placed in service in 2019 and 2020 and the remaining repowering projects are expected to be placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the repowered generating facilities totals $42 million in 2021, $19 million in 2022 and $64 million in 2023. The energy production from such repowered facilities is expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years following each facility's return to service.\nFuture Uses of Cash\nBHE and Other\n\u2022Electric transmission includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include PacifiCorp's costs for the 140-mile 500-kV Aeolus-Bridger/Anticline transmission line, which is a major segment of PacifiCorp's Energy Gateway Transmission expansion program placed in-service in November 2020, the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program and AltaLink's directly assigned projects from the AESO. Operating expenditures include system reinforcement and investments in routine expenditures for transmission needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $1,148 million for 2020, $338 million for 2019 and $9 million for 2018 and includes 674 MWs of new wind-powered generating facilities that were placed in-service in 2020 and 516 MWs expected to be placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the new wind-powered generating facilities totals $43 million in 2021 and $533 million in 2023. The energy production from the new wind-powered generating facilities is expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years once the equipment is placed in-service.\nNV Energy\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment was used in regulated businesses as of December 31, 2020, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets.\n\u2022$50 million higher net income at the Utilities with favorable performance at all four utilities (actual retail customer sales volumes increased 74 GWhs, or 0.1%), including $193 million of higher PTCs recognized, offset by a comparative increase in wildfire and other storm restoration costs, primarily at PacifiCorp;\nOn December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expands the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which is effective as of the PJM's next capacity auction. While the FERC included some limited exemptions in its order, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement (\"FRR\") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. In response to the FERC's order, the PJM submitted a compliance filing on March 18, 2020, wherein the PJM proposes tariff language reflecting the FERC's directives and a schedule for resuming capacity auctions. On April 16, 2020, the FERC issued an order largely denying requests for rehearing of the FERC's December 2019 order but granting a few clarifications that required an additional PJM compliance filing, which it submitted on June 1, 2020. On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing of its April 16, 2020 order and accepting the PJM's two compliance filings, subject to a further compliance filing to revise minor aspects of the proposed MOPR methodology. As part of that order, the FERC also accepted the PJM's proposal to condense the schedule of activities leading up to the next capacity auction but did not specify when that schedule would commence given that a key element of the MOPR level computation remains pending before the FERC in another proceeding. In November 2020, the PJM announced that the next capacity auction will be conducted in May 2021.\nPacifiCorp\nNet income increased $34 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $55 million, lower pension and post retirement expense of $11 million and higher utility margin of $4 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $25 million from additional plant placed in-service, lower PTCs of $21 million from expirations, higher interest expense of $17 million and higher operations and maintenance expense of $10 million, primarily due to costs associated with the early retirement of a coal-fueled generation unit totaling $24 million offset by a decrease in wildfire suppression costs of $9 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled generation costs, higher wholesale average market prices, higher retail revenue primarily due to favorable customer volumes and higher net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes, higher purchased electricity costs, higher natural gas-fueled generation costs and lower net wheeling revenue.\nOperating revenue increased $259 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase from acquired businesses of $221 million and higher mortgage revenue at existing businesses of $103 million from a 32% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity, partially offset by lower brokerage revenue at existing businesses of $74 million mainly due to a 1% decrease in closed transaction volume. Net income increased $15 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher earnings at existing mortgage businesses of $33 million due to an increase in refinance activity and net income from acquired businesses of $9 million, partially offset by $36 million of lower earnings at existing brokerage businesses primarily from lower closed volume and margins.\nThe Company's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):\nThe Company has contractual cash obligations that may affect its consolidated financial condition. The following table summarizes the Company's material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nHomeServices\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of $2.7 billion, unused revolving credit facilities of $173 million and letters of credit outstanding of $88 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was $1.3 billion, unused revolving credit facilities was $87 million and outstanding letters of credit was $43 million. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facilities is non-recourse to the Company. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding letters of credit is recourse to the Company. Although the Company is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity.\n\u2022$194 million higher net income at the Utilities with favorable performance at all four utilities (actual retail customer sales volumes increased 74 GWhs, or 0.1%), including $49 million of higher PTCs recognized;\n\nInvesting Activities\n* Not meaningful.\nOverview\nThe Company has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customers' rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisitions of existing assets.\nOperating Activities\n\u2022$55 million lower net income at Northern Powergrid, mainly due to a deferred income tax charge in 2020 from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\nAccounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\n\u2022$102 million higher net income at BHE Renewables, primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind projects, including increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments largely from projects reaching commercial operation, and higher earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.1 billion. Sources of cash totaled $5.4 billion and consisted of proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $4.7 billion and net proceeds from short-term debt of $684 million. Uses of cash totaled $2.3 billion and consisted mainly of $1.9 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt and repurchases of common stock of $293 million.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nOperating revenue increased $923 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $440 million from a 13% increase in closed transaction volume and higher mortgage revenue of $423 million from a 71% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment. Net income increased $215 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage services of $138 million and higher earnings at brokerage services largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment.\nReportable Segment Results\nThe Company may from time to time seek to acquire its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any debt securities repurchased by the Company may be reissued or resold by the Company from time to time and will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nBHE Renewables\nOperating revenue increased $42 million for 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher retail revenue of $40 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $2 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer volumes of $31 million and higher average retail rates of $9 million. Retail customer volumes increased 0.4% primarily due to an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather, partially offset by lower customer usage. Wholesale and other revenue increased primarily due to higher wholesale average market prices, largely offset by lower wholesale volumes.\nThe PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (\"PJM\") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule (\"MOPR\"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a government-provided financial support program, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. An expanded PJM MOPR to include existing resources would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of Quad Cities Station not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions.\nOn October 29, 2020, BHE issued $3.75 billion of its 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock to certain subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in order to fund the GT&S Cash Consideration and the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration.\n\u25e6Repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $37 million for 2020, $369 million for 2019 and $422 million for 2018. The repowering projects entail the replacement of significant components of older turbines. Planned spending for the repowered generating facilities totals $409 million in 2021 and $673 million in 2022. Of the 1,079 MWs of current repowering projects not in-service as of December 31, 2020, 80 MWs are currently expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years following each facility's return to service, 592 MWs are expected to qualify for 80% of such credits and 407 MWs are expected to qualify for 60% of such credits.\nEach of BHE's direct and indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from BHE and its other subsidiaries. It should not be assumed that the assets of any subsidiary will be available to satisfy BHE's obligations or the obligations of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law, regulatory commitments and the terms of financing and ring-fencing arrangements for such parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to BHE or affiliates thereof. The Company's long-term debt may include provisions that allow BHE or its subsidiaries to redeem such debt in whole or in part at any time. These provisions generally include make-whole premiums. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the limitation of distributions from BHE's subsidiaries.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Company has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, an amount is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. Certain equity investments are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of investment tax credits.\nNet income and operating revenue for the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December 31 are summarized as follows (in millions):\nDebt of BHE and debt and preferred securities of certain of its subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of the rated company's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time.\nInflation\nOperating revenue decreased $48 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and the stronger United States dollar of $7 million. Net income increased $2 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada and higher net income at BHE U.S. Transmission of $6 million mainly due to improved equity earnings from ETT, partially offset by the impacts of regulatory decisions received in 2020 and 2019 at AltaLink.\nOperating revenue decreased $183 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue. Electric operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower fully-bundled energy rates (offset in cost of sales) of $164 million and a $120 million one-time bill credit given to customers in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses), partially offset by higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, largely offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial, distribution only service and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $(174) million. Sources of cash totaled $5.6 billion and consisted of proceeds from BHE senior debt issuances of $3.2 billion and proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $2.4 billion. Uses of cash totaled $5.8 billion and consisted mainly of $2.4 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt, net repayments of short term debt of $1.9 billion, $1.0 billion for repayments of BHE senior debt and the purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest of $131 million.\nBHE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities.\nThe Company chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced.\nExelon Generation Company, LLC (\"Exelon Generation\"), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 (\"Quad Cities Station\") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25% ownership interest, announced on June 2, 2016, its intention to shut down Quad Cities Station on June 1, 2018. In December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs will provide Exelon Generation additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy will not receive additional revenue from the subsidy.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, BHE repurchased 180,358 shares of its common stock for $126 million, 447,712 shares of its common stock for $293 million and 177,381 shares of its common stock for $107 million, respectively.\nCOVID-19\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(13.2) billion and $(9.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions and higher funding of tax equity investments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $599 million. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nThe Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $11.5 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2020. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. The Company uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings or rate base; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, the Company incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors. Refer to Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's goodwill.\n\n\nThe Regulated Businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, the Regulated Businesses defer the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNorthern Powergrid\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $(9.0) billion and $(7.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $1.1 billion and higher funding of tax equity investments. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nSeveral of the Company's businesses have been deemed essential and their employees have been identified as \"critical infrastructure employees\" allowing them to move within communities and across jurisdictional boundaries as necessary to maintain the electric generation, transmission and distribution systems and the natural gas transportation and distribution systems. In response to the effects of COVID-19, the Company has implemented various business continuity plans to protect its employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, including situational use of personal protective equipment by employees when interacting with customers and implementing practices to enhance social distancing at the workplace. Such practices have included work-from-home, staggered work schedules, rotational work location assignments, increased cleaning and sanitation of work spaces and providing general health reminders intended to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results.\nCommon Stock Transactions\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a net liability totaling $138 million for the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2020, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in net regulatory assets totaled $604 million and in AOCI totaled $655 million.\n(1)Not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at BHE Renewables totaling $15 million for 2019 and $717 million for 2018. BHE Renewables placed in-service 512 MWs during 2018.\nIn accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels (\"credit-risk-related contingent features\") or provide the right for counterparties to demand \"adequate assurance,\" or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable entities' credit ratings from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2020, the Company would have been required to post $307 million of additional collateral. The Company's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors.\nNet income increased $37 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $197 million from higher PTCs recognized of $132 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $77 million due to additional assets placed in-service (offset by $23 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals), lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $45 million, higher interest expense of $20 million and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. PTCs recognized increased due to higher wind-powered generation driven primarily by repowering and new wind projects placed in-service. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower wholesale revenue and the price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower generation costs from higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes. Natural gas utility margin decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather.\nNet income attributable to BHE shareholders increased $3,993 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized loss in 2019 of $313 million ($227 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2020 was $3,473 million, an increase of $296 million, or 9%, compared to adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2019 of $3,177 million.\nOperating revenue decreased $2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue of $17 million, partially offset by higher natural gas operating revenue of $15 million. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower retail revenue of $32 million, partially offset by higher wholesale and other revenue of $15 million. Electric retail revenue decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes of $50 million and a decrease from a tax rate reduction rider effective April 2018 of $17 million, partially offset by higher fully-bundled energy rates (offset in cost of sales) of $31 million and an increase in the average number of customers of $9 million. Electric retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of weather, net of increased distribution only service customer volumes. Natural gas operating revenue increased due to a higher average per-unit price (offset in cost of sales) of $13 million and higher volumes from the impacts of weather.\n\u2022Electric distribution includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include new customer connections and enhancements to existing customer connections. Operating expenditures include ongoing distribution systems infrastructure needed at the Utilities and Northern Powergrid, wildfire mitigation, damage restoration and storm damage repairs and investments in routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\n\u2022$215 million higher net income at HomeServices, primarily due to higher earnings from mortgage services (71% increase in funded mortgage volume) and brokerage services (13% increase in closed transaction volume) largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment; and\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, RPS, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and capital expenditure requirements, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Refer to \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations.\nA variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, mortality assumptions, plan changes and the Company's funding policy for each plan.\nIn determining the Company's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the Company's various regulatory commissions. The Company's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of the Company's federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations is uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.\nNatural Gas Transmission and Storage Business Acquisition\nNet income attributable to BHE shareholders increased $382 million for 2019 compared to 2018. Included in these results were pre-tax unrealized losses on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited ($313 million, $227 million after-tax, in 2019 and $526 million, $383 million after-tax, in 2018) and a $134 million income tax benefit in 2018 related to the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings as a result of 2017 Tax Reform. Excluding the impacts of these items, adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2019 was $3,177 million, an increase of $360 million, or 13%, compared to adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2018 of $2,817 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe timing of the Company's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods and assumptions for each payment date.\nThe Company has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, the issuance of equity and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which BHE and each subsidiary has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, its credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry and project finance markets, among other items.\n\u2022Wind generation expenditures include the following:\n\u2022$3,585 higher net income at BHE and Other due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\n\n\u2022Natural gas transmission and storage includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures includes, among other items, the Northern Natural Gas New Lisbon Expansion and Twin Cities Area Expansion projects. Operating expenditures include, among other items, asset modernization and pipeline integrity projects.\nPreferred Stock Issuance\nCollateral and Contingent Features\nRevenue recognized is equal to what the Company has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The determination of customer invoices is based on a systematic reading of meters, fixed reservation charges based on contractual quantities and rates or, in the case of the Great Britain distribution businesses, when information is received from the national settlement system. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was $750 million as of December 31, 2020. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings.\n\u2022$35 million higher net income at BHE Pipeline Group, primarily due to higher transportation revenue; and\nExelon Generation is currently working with PJM and other stakeholders to pursue the FRR option as an alternative to the next PJM capacity auction. If Illinois implements the FRR option, Quad Cities Station could be removed from PJM's capacity auction and instead supply capacity and be compensated under the FRR program. If Illinois cannot implement an FRR program in its PJM zones, then the MOPR will apply to Quad Cities Station, resulting in higher offers for its units that may not clear the capacity market. Implementing the FRR program in Illinois will require both legislative and regulatory changes. MidAmerican Energy cannot predict whether or when such legislative and regulatory changes can be implemented or their potential impact on the continued operation of Quad Cities Station.\n(1) Includes the drawn uncommitted credit facilities totaling $23 million at Northern Powergrid.\nIt is probable the Company's regulated businesses will pass income tax benefits and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35% to 21% as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2020, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of $3.3 billion and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse.\nOperating revenue decreased $72 million for 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower gas sales of $89 million at Northern Natural Gas related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales), partially offset by higher transportation revenue of $19 million. Transportation revenue increased from generally higher volumes and rates, partially offset by the impact of period two rates of $26 million (largely offset in depreciation and amortization expense) and $11 million from refunds related to 2017 Tax Reform at Kern River. Net income increased $35 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the higher transportation revenue, excluding the impact of period two rates, lower property and other tax expense of $9 million due to a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019 and favorable margin of $9 million on system balancing activities, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, net of the impact of lower depreciation rates at Kern River, due to increased spending on capital projects.\nHistorically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where BHE's subsidiaries operate have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. In the United States and Canada, the Regulated Businesses operate under cost-of-service based rate structures administered by various state and provincial commissions and the FERC. Under these rate structures, the Regulated Businesses are allowed to include prudent costs in their rates, including the impact of inflation. The price control formula used by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies incorporates the rate of inflation in determining rates charged to customers. BHE's subsidiaries attempt to minimize the potential impact of inflation on their operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful.\n\u25e6MidAmerican Energy is currently planning to construct 483 MWs of additional wind-powered generating facilities, for which the related projects are at varying stages of development. Planned spending for those projects totals $461 million for 2021, $16 million for 2022 and $421 million for 2023.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nDebt Repurchases\nRefer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Company's credit facilities, letters of credit, equity commitments and other related items.\nCapital Expenditures\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in income tax receipts.\nBHE Transmission\n\nOn November 1, 2020, BHE completed its acquisition of substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage business of DEI and Dominion Questar, exclusive of the Questar Pipeline Group (the \"GT&S Transaction\"). Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 3, 2020 (the \"GT&S Purchase Agreement\"), BHE paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash, after post-closing adjustments (the \"GT&S Cash Consideration\"), and assumed approximately $5.6 billion of existing indebtedness for borrowed money, including fair value adjustments.\n\u2022Other capital expenditures includes both growth and operating expenditures, including routine expenditures for generation and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand, natural gas distribution, technology, and environmental spending relating to emissions control equipment and the management of CCR.\nThe increase in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $848 million for 2020, $1,486 million for 2019 and $1,261 million for 2018. MidAmerican Energy placed in-service 729 MWs (nominal ratings) during 2020, including the acquisition of an existing 80-MW wind farm, 1,019 MWs (nominal ratings) during 2019 and 817 MWs (nominal ratings) during 2018. Wind XI, a 2,000-MW project, was completed in January 2020. Wind XII, a 592-MW project, was placed in-service in 2019 and 2020. MidAmerican Energy had three other wind-powered generation projects under construction in 2020 that totaled 319 MWs, including facilities placed in-service in 2020 and the remainder expected to be placed in-service in early 2021. MidAmerican Energy expects all of these wind-powered generating facilities to qualify for 100% of PTCs available. PTCs from these projects are excluded from MidAmerican Energy's Iowa energy adjustment clause until these generation assets are reflected in base rates.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe Company has other types of commitments that arise primarily from unused lines of credit, letters of credit or relate to construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7 and Note 9), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 12) and AROs (refer to Note 14), which have not been included in the above table because the amount and timing of the cash payments are not certain. Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's total net liquidity was as follows (in millions):\nThe Company's historical and forecast capital expenditures consisted mainly of the following:\nThe Company chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00% by 2025, at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for healthcare cost trend rate sensitivity disclosures.\n(1)BHE and Other includes intersegment eliminations.\nOperating revenue decreased $58 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas volumes at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC. Net loss remained the same for 2019 compared to 2018 as the change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited of $156 million was offset by a $134 million income tax benefit recognized in 2018 related to the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, higher BHE corporate interest expense and lower net income of $14 million at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC driven by unrealized mark-to-market losses on contracts.\nThe estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what the Company would expect to recover from the future use of the asset. Changes in judgment that could significantly alter the calculation of the fair value or the recoverable amount of the asset may result from significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset or the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect the Company's results of operations.\nNet income decreased $32 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance expense due to higher costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement of $169 million, higher interest expense of $25 million from higher long-term debt balances, higher pension and other postretirement costs of $13 million, lower interest income from lower average interest rates and higher property taxes of $10 million, partially offset by lower tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $62 million from repowered and new wind-powered generating facilities, higher utility margin of $47 million and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $38 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs, lower purchased power costs and price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms and lower retail customer volumes.\nNet income increased $45 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $100 million, lower pension and post-retirement costs of $9 million and lower income tax expense mainly from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expense, mainly from higher earnings sharing accruals at the Nevada Utilities, and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $20 million, mainly from higher plant placed in-service. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6,224 million and $6,206 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income tax receipts and improved operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nOperating revenue increased $273 million for 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher retail revenue of $250 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $23 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to $234 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain property, plant and equipment and the accelerated amortization of certain regulatory asset balances in relation to Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in December 2020. The increase in retail revenue was also due to price impacts of $49 million from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower customer volumes of $34 million. The increase in wholesale and other revenue was mainly due to $34 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances in Oregon to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain retired wind equipment, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nOperating revenue decreased $7 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the stronger United States dollar of $45 million and lower distributed units of $21 million, partially offset by higher distribution tariff rates of $39 million and higher smart meter revenue of $15 million due to a larger number of units installed. Net income increased $17 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower overall pension expense of $23 million, largely resulting from lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, and the higher distribution revenues, partially offset by higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $13 million and the stronger United States dollar of $10 million.\nOperating revenue increased $9 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $10 million from increased tariff rates of $40 million, partially offset by 5.4% lower units distributed of $30 million largely due to the impacts of COVID-19. Net income decreased $55 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to write-offs of gas exploration costs of $44 million, higher income tax expense of $37 million and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $18 million, partially offset by the higher distribution revenue, lower overall pension expense of $22 million, including lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2020 compared to 2019, and lower interest expense of $9 million. The increase in income tax expense is due to a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate that resulted in a deferred income tax charge of $35 million.\nOn October 5, 2020, DEI and Dominion Questar, as permitted under the terms of the GT&S Purchase Agreement, delivered notice to BHE of their election to terminate the GT&S Transaction with respect to the Questar Pipeline Group and, in connection with the execution of the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement referenced below, to waive the related termination fee under the GT&S Purchase Agreement. Also on October 5, 2020, BHE entered into a second Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \"Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement\") with Dominion Questar providing for BHE's purchase of the Questar Pipeline Group from Dominion Questar (the \"Q-Pipe Transaction\") after receipt of HSR Approval, which is currently anticipated in the first half of 2021, for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion (the \"Q-Pipe Cash Consideration\"), subject to adjustment for cash and indebtedness as of the closing, and the assumption of approximately $430 million of existing indebtedness for borrowed money. Under the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement, BHE delivered the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration of approximately $1.3 billion to Dominion Questar on November 2, 2020.\nThe reportable segment financial information includes all necessary adjustments and eliminations needed to conform to the Company's significant accounting policies. The differences between the reportable segment amounts and the consolidated amounts, described as BHE and Other, relate principally to other entities, corporate functions and intersegment eliminations.", "item_7_text": "\n\u2022$90 million higher net income at BHE Renewables, primarily due to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercial operation, offset by lower earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities;\nOperating revenue decreased $118 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas volumes at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC. Net income increased $3,585 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to the change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited of $3,697 million, partially offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $7.1 billion. Sources of cash totaled $11.7 billion and consisted of proceeds from BHE senior debt issuances of $5.2 billion, proceeds from preferred stock issuances of $3.8 billion and proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $2.7 billion. Uses of cash totaled $4.5 billion and consisted mainly of $2.8 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt, net repayments of short term debt of $939 million and $350 million for repayments of BHE senior debt.\n(1)Includes the tax attributes of disregarded entities that are not required to pay income taxes and the earnings of which are taxable directly to BHE.\n\u2022Solar generation includes growth expenditures, including MidAmerican Energy's current plan to construct 767 MWs of small- and utility-scale solar generation, for which the related projects are in varying stages of development. Nevada Power's solar generation investment includes expenditures for a 150 MW solar photovoltaic facility with an additional 100 MW capacity of co-located battery storage, known as the Dry Lake generating facility. Commercial operation at Dry Lake is expected by the end of 2023.\nThe increase in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to:\nContractual Obligations\nBHE Pipeline Group\nOperating revenue increased $447 million for 2020 compared to 2019 due to $331 million of incremental revenue from the GT&S Transaction, a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $101 million and higher transportation revenue of $43 million, partially offset by lower gas sales at Northern Natural Gas of $23 million related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales). Net income increased $106 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to $73 million of incremental net income from the GT&S Transaction, the higher transportation revenue, and a favorable after-tax, rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas of $32 million, partially offset by higher property and other tax expense of $17 million, including a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $13 million due to increased spending on capital projects and lower interest income of $9 million.\nThe key assumptions used may differ materially from period to period due to changing market and economic conditions. These differences may result in a significant impact to pension and other postretirement benefits expense and the funded status. If changes were to occur for the following key assumptions, the approximate effect on the Consolidated Financial Statements would be as follows (dollars in millions):\nAdditionally, the Company has invested in projects sponsored by third parties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments. Under the terms of these tax equity investments, the Company has entered into equity capital contribution agreements with the project sponsors that require contributions. The Company has made contributions of $2,736 million, $1,619 million and $698 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and has commitments as of December 31, 2020, subject to satisfaction of certain specified conditions, to provide equity contributions of $563 million in 2021 pursuant to these equity capital contribution agreements as the various projects achieve commercial operation. Once a project achieves commercial operation, the Company enters into a partnership agreement with the project sponsor that directs and allocates the operating profits and tax benefits from the project.\nOperating revenue increased $24 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher wind revenues of $32 million and higher natural gas and geothermal revenues of $32 million due to higher generation and pricing from market opportunities, partially offset by lower hydro revenues of $28 million due to lower rainfall and lower solar revenues of $11 million due to lower insolation. Wind revenues increased primarily due to $33 million from new projects and a favorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $11 million, partially offset by lower generation of $12 million at existing projects. Net income increased $102 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher wind earnings of $74 million and higher geothermal earnings of $53 million, largely due to higher generation and margins from market opportunities and lower operations and maintenance expense, partially offset by lower hydro earnings of $20 million, primarily due to lower rainfall and a declining financial asset balance, and lower solar earnings of $5 million primarily due to lower insolation. Wind earnings were favorable primarily due to improved tax equity investment earnings of $49 million, earnings from new projects of $35 million and a favorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $11 million, partially offset by lower revenues on existing projects of $12 million, primarily from lower generation, and $8 million of unfavorable changes in the valuation of interest rate swap derivatives. Tax equity investment earnings were favorable due to $57 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation and $7 million of higher commitment fee income, partially offset by $13 million of lower earnings from existing projects mainly due to lower generation caused by turbine blade repairs.\nThe Company continually evaluates the applicability of the guidance for regulated operations and whether its regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates by considering factors such as a change in the regulator's approach to setting rates from cost-based ratemaking to another form of regulation, other regulatory actions or the impact of competition that could limit the Regulated Businesses' ability to recover their costs. The Company believes the application of the guidance for regulated operations is appropriate and its existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of inclusion in future regulated rates. The evaluation reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the federal, state and provincial levels. If it becomes no longer probable that the deferred costs or income will be included in future regulated rates, the related regulatory assets and liabilities will be recognized in net income, returned to customers or re-established as AOCI. Total regulatory assets were $3.4 billion and total regulatory liabilities were $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Regulated Businesses' regulatory assets and liabilities.\nOperating revenue decreased $3 million for 2019 compared to 2018, mainly due to the stronger United States dollar of $17 million, largely offset by favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 at AltaLink. Net income increased $19 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to favorable regulatory decisions received in 2019 and the unfavorable impacts of a regulatory rate order received in 2018 at AltaLink and higher equity earnings at ETT, partially offset by the stronger United States dollar impact of $5 million.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company has not established deferred income taxes on its undistributed foreign earnings that have been determined by management to be reinvested indefinitely; however, the Company periodically evaluates its capital requirements. If circumstances change in the future and a portion of the Company's undistributed foreign earnings were repatriated, the dividends may be subject to taxation in the United States but the tax is not expected to be material.\nMidAmerican Funding\nOperating revenue decreased $126 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $76 million (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower natural gas operating revenue of $66 million, partially offset by higher other operating revenue of $13 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services, and higher electric operating revenue of $3 million. Electric operating revenue increased due to higher retail revenue of $77 million, partially offset by lower wholesale and other revenue of $74 million. Electric retail revenue increased due to higher customer usage of $76 million and higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of fuel and energy, operations and maintenance expense and income tax expense), primarily the energy adjustment clause, partially offset by lower average rates of $54 million due to sales mix and $19 million from the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.4% as an increase in industrial volumes of 4.0% was largely offset by lower residential volumes from the unfavorable impact of weather and lower customer usage. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased due to 10.6% lower sales volumes and $35 million from lower average per-unit prices. Natural gas operating revenue decreased from lower recoveries through the purchased gas adjustment clause due to a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold totaling $69 million (offset in cost of sales), partially offset by an increase in retail sales volumes of 2.0% from the favorable impact of weather in 2019.\n\u2022$106 million higher net income at BHE Pipeline Group, primarily due to $73 million of incremental net income from the GT&S Transaction and a favorable rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas;\nIn establishing its assumption as to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, the Company utilizes the expected asset allocation and return assumptions for each asset class based on historical performance and forward-looking views of the financial markets. Pension and other postretirement benefits expense increases as the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets decreases. The Company regularly reviews its actual asset allocations and rebalances its investments to its targeted allocations when considered appropriate.\nCertain accounting measurements require management to make estimates and judgments concerning transactions that will be settled several years in the future. Amounts recognized on the Consolidated Financial Statements based on such estimates involve numerous assumptions subject to varying and potentially significant degrees of judgment and uncertainty and will likely change in the future as additional information becomes available. The following critical accounting estimates are impacted significantly by the Company's methods, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nOn May 21, 2020, the FERC issued an order involving reforms to the PJM's day-ahead and real-time reserves markets that need to be reflected in the calculation of MOPR levels. In approving reforms to the PJM's reserves markets, the FERC also directed the PJM to develop a new methodology for estimating revenues that resources will receive for sales of energy and related services, which will then be used in calculating a number of parameters and assumptions used in the capacity market, including MOPR levels. The PJM submitted its new revenue projection methodology on August 5, 2020. On review of this compliance filing, the FERC is expected to address how these additional reforms will impact MOPR levels, the timeline for implementing the new revenue projection methodology, and the timing for commencing the capacity auction schedule.\nResults of Operations\nIn March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic and containment and mitigation measures were recommended worldwide, which has had an unprecedented impact on society in general and many of the customers served by the Company. While COVID-19 has impacted the Company's financial results and operations through December 31, 2020, the impacts have not been material. However, more severe impacts may still occur that could adversely affect future financial results depending on the duration and extent of COVID-19. Most jurisdictions in which the Company operates have moved to varying phases of recovery plans with most businesses opening subject to certain operating restrictions. As the impacts of COVID-19 and related customer and governmental responses remain uncertain, including the duration of restrictions on business openings, reductions in the consumption of electricity or natural gas may continue to occur, particularly in the commercial and industrial classes. Due to regulatory requirements and voluntary actions taken by the Utilities and Northern Powergrid related to customer collection activity and suspension of disconnections for non-payment, the Utilities and Northern Powergrid have seen delays and reductions in cash receipts from retail customers related to the impacts of COVID-19, which could result in higher than normal bad debt write-offs. The amount of such reductions in cash receipts through December 2020 has not been material compared to the same period in 2019, but uncertainty remains. Regulatory jurisdictions may allow for the deferral or recovery of certain costs incurred in responding to COVID-19. Refer to \"Regulatory Matters\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. Residential property transactions may also decline in the future at HomeServices due to the varying phases of state recovery plans and associated duration of restrictions on business openings, other measures and general economic uncertainty.\nOperating revenue increased $4 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher natural gas, solar and hydro revenues of $21 million due to favorable generation, partially offset by an unfavorable change in the valuation of a power purchase agreement of $14 million and lower geothermal revenues of $4 million from lower pricing. Net income increased $90 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to favorable wind tax equity investment earnings of $129 million, partially offset by lower geothermal earnings of $22 million, due to higher operations and maintenance expense and lower pricing, and lower natural gas earnings of $17 million, due to lower margins. Wind tax equity investment earnings improved due to $147 million of earnings from projects reaching commercial operation, partially offset by lower commitment fee income of $15 million and lower earnings from existing tax equity investments of $6 million.\nNet income increased $112 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $115 million, largely due to higher PTCs of $70 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, higher electric utility margin, higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds of $32 million and higher investment earnings, partially offset by higher interest expense of $55 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $30 million due to additional assets placed in-service offset by $46 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals. Electric utility margin increased due to lower generation costs from higher wind generation, higher recoveries through bill riders (substantially offset in cost of fuel and energy, operations and maintenance expense and income tax expense) and higher retail customer volumes.\nNet income increased $48 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower operations and maintenance expense, largely due to lower political activity expenses and lower earnings sharing accruals of $23 million at Nevada Power, partially offset by lower electric utility margin of $58 million and higher depreciation and amortization expense. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower retail customer volumes and lower average retail rates from a tax rate reduction rider, partially offset by an increase in the average number of customers and higher wholesale and transmission revenue.\nQuad Cities Generating Station Operating Status\nOperating revenue decreased $199 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower natural gas operating revenue of $77 million, lower electric operating revenue of $70 million, lower electric and natural gas energy efficiency program revenue of $38 million (offset in operations and maintenance expense) and lower other revenue of $14 million, primarily from nonregulated utility construction services. Natural gas operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower volumes and a lower average per-unit cost of natural gas sold resulting in lower purchased gas adjustment recoveries of $68 million (offset in cost of sales) and a 10.2% decrease in retail customer volumes, primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower wholesale and other revenue of $88 million, partially offset by higher retail revenue of $18 million. Electric wholesale and other revenue decreased mainly due to lower average wholesale per-unit prices of $115 million, partially offset by higher wholesale volumes of $28 million. Electric retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer usage of $38 million, partially offset by price impacts of $18 million from changes in sales mix. Electric retail customer volumes increased 1.2% due to increased usage for certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower commercial and industrial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\n\u25e6Repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $125 million for 2020, $585 million for 2019 and $332 million for 2018. The repowering projects entail the replacement of significant components of older turbines. Certain repowering projects were placed in service in 2019 and 2020 and the remaining repowering projects are expected to be placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the repowered generating facilities totals $42 million in 2021, $19 million in 2022 and $64 million in 2023. The energy production from such repowered facilities is expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years following each facility's return to service.\nFuture Uses of Cash\nBHE and Other\n\u2022Electric transmission includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include PacifiCorp's costs for the 140-mile 500-kV Aeolus-Bridger/Anticline transmission line, which is a major segment of PacifiCorp's Energy Gateway Transmission expansion program placed in-service in November 2020, the Nevada Utilities' Greenlink Nevada transmission expansion program and AltaLink's directly assigned projects from the AESO. Operating expenditures include system reinforcement and investments in routine expenditures for transmission needed to serve existing and expected demand.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at PacifiCorp totaling $1,148 million for 2020, $338 million for 2019 and $9 million for 2018 and includes 674 MWs of new wind-powered generating facilities that were placed in-service in 2020 and 516 MWs expected to be placed in-service in 2021. Planned spending for the new wind-powered generating facilities totals $43 million in 2021 and $533 million in 2023. The energy production from the new wind-powered generating facilities is expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years once the equipment is placed in-service.\nNV Energy\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets for impairment, including property, plant and equipment, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or the assets are being held for sale. Upon the occurrence of a triggering event, the asset is reviewed to assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset plus the residual value from the ultimate disposal exceeds the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated recoverable amounts, the asset is written down to the estimated fair value and any resulting impairment loss is reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As substantially all property, plant and equipment was used in regulated businesses as of December 31, 2020, the impacts of regulation are considered when evaluating the carrying value of regulated assets.\n\u2022$50 million higher net income at the Utilities with favorable performance at all four utilities (actual retail customer sales volumes increased 74 GWhs, or 0.1%), including $193 million of higher PTCs recognized, offset by a comparative increase in wildfire and other storm restoration costs, primarily at PacifiCorp;\nOn December 19, 2019, the FERC issued an order requiring the PJM to broadly apply the MOPR to all new and existing resources, including nuclear. This greatly expands the breadth and scope of the PJM's MOPR, which is effective as of the PJM's next capacity auction. While the FERC included some limited exemptions in its order, no exemptions were available to state-supported nuclear resources, such as Quad Cities Station. The FERC provided no new mechanism for accommodating state-supported resources other than the existing Fixed Resource Requirement (\"FRR\") mechanism under which an entire utility zone would be removed from PJM's capacity auction along with sufficient resources to support the load in such zone. In response to the FERC's order, the PJM submitted a compliance filing on March 18, 2020, wherein the PJM proposes tariff language reflecting the FERC's directives and a schedule for resuming capacity auctions. On April 16, 2020, the FERC issued an order largely denying requests for rehearing of the FERC's December 2019 order but granting a few clarifications that required an additional PJM compliance filing, which it submitted on June 1, 2020. On October 15, 2020, the FERC issued an order denying requests for rehearing of its April 16, 2020 order and accepting the PJM's two compliance filings, subject to a further compliance filing to revise minor aspects of the proposed MOPR methodology. As part of that order, the FERC also accepted the PJM's proposal to condense the schedule of activities leading up to the next capacity auction but did not specify when that schedule would commence given that a key element of the MOPR level computation remains pending before the FERC in another proceeding. In November 2020, the PJM announced that the next capacity auction will be conducted in May 2021.\nPacifiCorp\nNet income increased $34 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $55 million, lower pension and post retirement expense of $11 million and higher utility margin of $4 million, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $25 million from additional plant placed in-service, lower PTCs of $21 million from expirations, higher interest expense of $17 million and higher operations and maintenance expense of $10 million, primarily due to costs associated with the early retirement of a coal-fueled generation unit totaling $24 million offset by a decrease in wildfire suppression costs of $9 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled generation costs, higher wholesale average market prices, higher retail revenue primarily due to favorable customer volumes and higher net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes, higher purchased electricity costs, higher natural gas-fueled generation costs and lower net wheeling revenue.\nOperating revenue increased $259 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to an increase from acquired businesses of $221 million and higher mortgage revenue at existing businesses of $103 million from a 32% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity, partially offset by lower brokerage revenue at existing businesses of $74 million mainly due to a 1% decrease in closed transaction volume. Net income increased $15 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to higher earnings at existing mortgage businesses of $33 million due to an increase in refinance activity and net income from acquired businesses of $9 million, partially offset by $36 million of lower earnings at existing brokerage businesses primarily from lower closed volume and margins.\nThe Company's historical and forecast capital expenditures, each of which exclude amounts for non-cash equity AFUDC and other non-cash items, by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 are as follows (in millions):\nThe Company has contractual cash obligations that may affect its consolidated financial condition. The following table summarizes the Company's material contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nHomeServices\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's investments that are accounted for under the equity method had short- and long-term debt of $2.7 billion, unused revolving credit facilities of $173 million and letters of credit outstanding of $88 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's pro-rata share of such short- and long-term debt was $1.3 billion, unused revolving credit facilities was $87 million and outstanding letters of credit was $43 million. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding short- and long-term debt and unused revolving credit facilities is non-recourse to the Company. The entire amount of the Company's pro-rata share of the outstanding letters of credit is recourse to the Company. Although the Company is generally not required to support debt service obligations of its equity investees, default with respect to this non-recourse short- and long-term debt could result in a loss of invested equity.\n\u2022$194 million higher net income at the Utilities with favorable performance at all four utilities (actual retail customer sales volumes increased 74 GWhs, or 0.1%), including $49 million of higher PTCs recognized;\n\nInvesting Activities\n* Not meaningful.\nOverview\nThe Company has significant future capital requirements. Capital expenditure needs are reviewed regularly by management and may change significantly as a result of these reviews, which may consider, among other factors, impacts to customers' rates; changes in environmental and other rules and regulations; outcomes of regulatory proceedings; changes in income tax laws; general business conditions; load projections; system reliability standards; the cost and efficiency of construction labor, equipment and materials; commodity prices; and the cost and availability of capital. Expenditures for certain assets may ultimately include acquisitions of existing assets.\nOperating Activities\n\u2022$55 million lower net income at Northern Powergrid, mainly due to a deferred income tax charge in 2020 from a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate;\nAccounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation\n\u2022$102 million higher net income at BHE Renewables, primarily due to improved earnings from renewable wind projects, including increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments largely from projects reaching commercial operation, and higher earnings from geothermal and natural gas facilities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $3.1 billion. Sources of cash totaled $5.4 billion and consisted of proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $4.7 billion and net proceeds from short-term debt of $684 million. Uses of cash totaled $2.3 billion and consisted mainly of $1.9 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt and repurchases of common stock of $293 million.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nOperating revenue increased $923 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher brokerage revenue of $440 million from a 13% increase in closed transaction volume and higher mortgage revenue of $423 million from a 71% increase in funded mortgage volume due to an increase in refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment. Net income increased $215 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher earnings at mortgage services of $138 million and higher earnings at brokerage services largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment.\nReportable Segment Results\nThe Company may from time to time seek to acquire its outstanding debt securities through cash purchases in the open market, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Any debt securities repurchased by the Company may be reissued or resold by the Company from time to time and will depend on prevailing market conditions, the Company's liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nBHE Renewables\nOperating revenue increased $42 million for 2019 compared to 2018 due to higher retail revenue of $40 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $2 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to higher customer volumes of $31 million and higher average retail rates of $9 million. Retail customer volumes increased 0.4% primarily due to an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather, partially offset by lower customer usage. Wholesale and other revenue increased primarily due to higher wholesale average market prices, largely offset by lower wholesale volumes.\nThe PJM Interconnection, L.L.C. (\"PJM\") capacity market includes a Minimum Offer Price Rule (\"MOPR\"). If a generation resource is subjected to a MOPR, its offer price in the market is adjusted to effectively remove the revenues it receives through a government-provided financial support program, resulting in a higher offer that may not clear the capacity market. Prior to December 19, 2019, the PJM MOPR applied only to certain new gas-fired resources. An expanded PJM MOPR to include existing resources would require exclusion of ZEC compensation when bidding into future capacity auctions, resulting in an increased risk of Quad Cities Station not receiving capacity revenues in future auctions.\nOn October 29, 2020, BHE issued $3.75 billion of its 4.00% Perpetual Preferred Stock to certain subsidiaries of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. in order to fund the GT&S Cash Consideration and the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration.\n\u25e6Repowering certain existing wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $37 million for 2020, $369 million for 2019 and $422 million for 2018. The repowering projects entail the replacement of significant components of older turbines. Planned spending for the repowered generating facilities totals $409 million in 2021 and $673 million in 2022. Of the 1,079 MWs of current repowering projects not in-service as of December 31, 2020, 80 MWs are currently expected to qualify for 100% of the federal PTCs available for ten years following each facility's return to service, 592 MWs are expected to qualify for 80% of such credits and 407 MWs are expected to qualify for 60% of such credits.\nEach of BHE's direct and indirect subsidiaries is organized as a legal entity separate and apart from BHE and its other subsidiaries. It should not be assumed that the assets of any subsidiary will be available to satisfy BHE's obligations or the obligations of its other subsidiaries. However, unrestricted cash or other assets that are available for distribution may, subject to applicable law, regulatory commitments and the terms of financing and ring-fencing arrangements for such parties, be advanced, loaned, paid as dividends or otherwise distributed or contributed to BHE or affiliates thereof. The Company's long-term debt may include provisions that allow BHE or its subsidiaries to redeem such debt in whole or in part at any time. These provisions generally include make-whole premiums. Refer to Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the limitation of distributions from BHE's subsidiaries.\nRegulatory Matters\nThe Company has certain investments that are accounted for under the equity method in accordance with GAAP. Accordingly, an amount is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as an equity investment and is increased or decreased for the Company's pro-rata share of earnings or losses, respectively, less any dividends from such investments. Certain equity investments are presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets net of investment tax credits.\nNet income and operating revenue for the Company's reportable segments for the years ended December 31 are summarized as follows (in millions):\nDebt of BHE and debt and preferred securities of certain of its subsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies. Assigned credit ratings are based on each rating agency's assessment of the rated company's ability to, in general, meet the obligations of its issued debt or preferred securities. The credit ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and there is no assurance that a particular credit rating will continue for any given period of time.\nInflation\nOperating revenue decreased $48 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to a regulatory decision received in November 2020 at AltaLink and the stronger United States dollar of $7 million. Net income increased $2 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower non-regulated interest expense at BHE Canada and higher net income at BHE U.S. Transmission of $6 million mainly due to improved equity earnings from ETT, partially offset by the impacts of regulatory decisions received in 2020 and 2019 at AltaLink.\nOperating revenue decreased $183 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue. Electric operating revenue decreased primarily due to lower fully-bundled energy rates (offset in cost of sales) of $164 million and a $120 million one-time bill credit given to customers in the fourth quarter of 2020 resulting from a regulatory rate review decision (offset in operations and maintenance and income tax expenses), partially offset by higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision. Electric retail customer volumes, including distribution only service customers, increased 1.5%, primarily due to the favorable impact of weather, largely offset by the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial, distribution only service and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage.\nNet cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $(174) million. Sources of cash totaled $5.6 billion and consisted of proceeds from BHE senior debt issuances of $3.2 billion and proceeds from subsidiary debt issuances totaling $2.4 billion. Uses of cash totaled $5.8 billion and consisted mainly of $2.4 billion for repayments of subsidiary debt, net repayments of short term debt of $1.9 billion, $1.0 billion for repayments of BHE senior debt and the purchase of redeemable noncontrolling interest of $131 million.\nBHE and its subsidiaries have no credit rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt, and a change in ratings is not an event of default under the applicable debt instruments. The Company's unsecured revolving credit facilities do not require the maintenance of a minimum credit rating level in order to draw upon their availability. However, commitment fees and interest rates under the credit facilities are tied to credit ratings and increase or decrease when the ratings change. A ratings downgrade could also increase the future cost of commercial paper, short- and long-term debt issuances or new credit facilities.\nThe Company chooses a discount rate based upon high quality debt security investment yields in effect as of the measurement date that corresponds to the expected benefit period. The pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities increase as the discount rate is reduced.\nExelon Generation Company, LLC (\"Exelon Generation\"), the operator of Quad Cities Generating Station Units 1 and 2 (\"Quad Cities Station\") of which MidAmerican Energy has a 25% ownership interest, announced on June 2, 2016, its intention to shut down Quad Cities Station on June 1, 2018. In December 2016, Illinois passed legislation creating a zero emission standard, which went into effect June 1, 2017. The zero emission standard requires the Illinois Power Agency to purchase ZECs and recover the costs from certain ratepayers in Illinois, subject to certain limitations. The proceeds from the ZECs will provide Exelon Generation additional revenue through 2027 as an incentive for continued operation of Quad Cities Station. MidAmerican Energy will not receive additional revenue from the subsidy.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, BHE repurchased 180,358 shares of its common stock for $126 million, 447,712 shares of its common stock for $293 million and 177,381 shares of its common stock for $107 million, respectively.\nCOVID-19\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $(13.2) billion and $(9.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions and higher funding of tax equity investments, partially offset by lower capital expenditures of $599 million. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nThe Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $11.5 billion. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment at least annually and completed its annual review as of October 31. Additionally, no indicators of impairment were identified as of December 31, 2020. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of the reporting unit and performing goodwill impairment tests. The Company uses a variety of methods to estimate a reporting unit's fair value, principally discounted projected future net cash flows. Key assumptions used include, but are not limited to, the use of estimated future cash flows; multiples of earnings or rate base; and an appropriate discount rate. Estimated future cash flows are impacted by, among other factors, growth rates, changes in regulations and rates, ability to renew contracts and estimates of future commodity prices. In estimating future cash flows, the Company incorporates current market information, as well as historical factors. Refer to Note 22 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's goodwill.\n\n\nThe Regulated Businesses prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance for regulated operations, which recognizes the economic effects of regulation. Accordingly, the Regulated Businesses defer the recognition of certain costs or income if it is probable that, through the ratemaking process, there will be a corresponding increase or decrease in future regulated rates. Regulatory assets and liabilities are established to reflect the impacts of these deferrals, which will be recognized in earnings in the periods the corresponding changes in regulated rates occur.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nNorthern Powergrid\nRevenue Recognition - Unbilled Revenue\nNet cash flows from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $(9.0) billion and $(7.0) billion, respectively. The change was primarily due to higher capital expenditures of $1.1 billion and higher funding of tax equity investments. Refer to \"Future Uses of Cash\" for further discussion of capital expenditures.\nSeveral of the Company's businesses have been deemed essential and their employees have been identified as \"critical infrastructure employees\" allowing them to move within communities and across jurisdictional boundaries as necessary to maintain the electric generation, transmission and distribution systems and the natural gas transportation and distribution systems. In response to the effects of COVID-19, the Company has implemented various business continuity plans to protect its employees and customers. Such plans include a variety of actions, including situational use of personal protective equipment by employees when interacting with customers and implementing practices to enhance social distancing at the workplace. Such practices have included work-from-home, staggered work schedules, rotational work location assignments, increased cleaning and sanitation of work spaces and providing general health reminders intended to help lower the risk of spreading COVID-19.\nThe following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the Company during the periods included herein. Explanations include management's best estimate of the impact of weather, customer growth, usage trends and other factors. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Company's historical Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The Company's actual results in the future could differ significantly from the historical results.\nCommon Stock Transactions\nCertain of the Company's subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that cover the majority of employees. The Company recognizes the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Funded status is the fair value of plan assets minus the benefit obligation as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a net liability totaling $138 million for the funded status of the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. As of December 31, 2020, amounts not yet recognized as a component of net periodic benefit cost that were included in net regulatory assets totaled $604 million and in AOCI totaled $655 million.\n(1)Not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe expense and benefit obligations relating to these defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are key assumptions, including discount rates, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and healthcare cost trend rates. These key assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate. The Company believes that the assumptions utilized in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior plan experience and current market and economic conditions. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for disclosures about the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, including the key assumptions used to calculate the funded status and net periodic benefit cost for these plans as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at BHE Renewables totaling $15 million for 2019 and $717 million for 2018. BHE Renewables placed in-service 512 MWs during 2018.\nIn accordance with industry practice, certain wholesale agreements, including derivative contracts, contain credit support provisions that in part base certain collateral requirements on credit ratings for senior unsecured debt as reported by one or more of the recognized credit rating agencies. These agreements may either specifically provide bilateral rights to demand cash or other security if credit exposures on a net basis exceed specified rating-dependent threshold levels (\"credit-risk-related contingent features\") or provide the right for counterparties to demand \"adequate assurance,\" or in some cases terminate the contract, in the event of a material adverse change in creditworthiness. These rights can vary by contract and by counterparty. As of December 31, 2020, the applicable entities' credit ratings from the recognized credit rating agencies were investment grade. If all credit-risk-related contingent features or adequate assurance provisions for these agreements had been triggered as of December 31, 2020, the Company would have been required to post $307 million of additional collateral. The Company's collateral requirements could fluctuate considerably due to market price volatility, changes in credit ratings, changes in legislation or regulation, or other factors.\nNet income increased $37 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher income tax benefit of $197 million from higher PTCs recognized of $132 million and the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense of $77 million due to additional assets placed in-service (offset by $23 million of lower Iowa revenue sharing accruals), lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $45 million, higher interest expense of $20 million and lower electric and natural gas utility margins. PTCs recognized increased due to higher wind-powered generation driven primarily by repowering and new wind projects placed in-service. Electric utility margin decreased due to lower wholesale revenue and the price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower generation costs from higher wind generation and higher retail customer volumes. Natural gas utility margin decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes primarily due to the unfavorable impact of weather.\nNet income attributable to BHE shareholders increased $3,993 million for 2020 compared to 2019. Included in these results was a pre-tax unrealized gain of $4,774 million ($3,470 million after-tax) compared to a pre-tax unrealized loss in 2019 of $313 million ($227 million after-tax) on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding the impact of this item, adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2020 was $3,473 million, an increase of $296 million, or 9%, compared to adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2019 of $3,177 million.\nOperating revenue decreased $2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electric operating revenue of $17 million, partially offset by higher natural gas operating revenue of $15 million. Electric operating revenue decreased due to lower retail revenue of $32 million, partially offset by higher wholesale and other revenue of $15 million. Electric retail revenue decreased primarily due to lower retail customer volumes of $50 million and a decrease from a tax rate reduction rider effective April 2018 of $17 million, partially offset by higher fully-bundled energy rates (offset in cost of sales) of $31 million and an increase in the average number of customers of $9 million. Electric retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of weather, net of increased distribution only service customer volumes. Natural gas operating revenue increased due to a higher average per-unit price (offset in cost of sales) of $13 million and higher volumes from the impacts of weather.\n\u2022Electric distribution includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures include new customer connections and enhancements to existing customer connections. Operating expenditures include ongoing distribution systems infrastructure needed at the Utilities and Northern Powergrid, wildfire mitigation, damage restoration and storm damage repairs and investments in routine expenditures for distribution needed to serve existing and expected demand.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets\n\u2022$215 million higher net income at HomeServices, primarily due to higher earnings from mortgage services (71% increase in funded mortgage volume) and brokerage services (13% increase in closed transaction volume) largely attributable to the favorable interest rate environment; and\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climate change, RPS, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential to impact its current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations and capital expenditure requirements, these laws and regulations provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance, including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions. These laws and regulations are administered by various federal, state, local and international agencies. The Company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, although many laws and regulations are subject to interpretation that may ultimately be resolved by the courts. Refer to \"Environmental Laws and Regulations\" in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding environmental laws and regulations.\nA variety of factors affect the funded status of the plans, including asset returns, discount rates, mortality assumptions, plan changes and the Company's funding policy for each plan.\nIn determining the Company's income taxes, management is required to interpret complex income tax laws and regulations, which includes consideration of regulatory implications imposed by the Company's various regulatory commissions. The Company's income tax returns are subject to continuous examinations by federal, state, local and foreign income tax authorities that may give rise to different interpretations of these complex laws and regulations. Due to the nature of the examination process, it generally takes years before these examinations are completed and these matters are resolved. The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more-likely-than-not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although the ultimate resolution of the Company's federal, state, local and foreign income tax examinations is uncertain, the Company believes it has made adequate provisions for these income tax positions. The aggregate amount of any additional income tax liabilities that may result from these examinations, if any, is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. Refer to Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the Company's income taxes.\nNatural Gas Transmission and Storage Business Acquisition\nNet income attributable to BHE shareholders increased $382 million for 2019 compared to 2018. Included in these results were pre-tax unrealized losses on the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited ($313 million, $227 million after-tax, in 2019 and $526 million, $383 million after-tax, in 2018) and a $134 million income tax benefit in 2018 related to the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings as a result of 2017 Tax Reform. Excluding the impacts of these items, adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2019 was $3,177 million, an increase of $360 million, or 13%, compared to adjusted net income attributable to BHE shareholders in 2018 of $2,817 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe timing of the Company's income tax cash flows from period to period can be significantly affected by the estimated federal income tax payment methods and assumptions for each payment date.\nThe Company has available a variety of sources of liquidity and capital resources, both internal and external, including net cash flows from operating activities, public and private debt offerings, the issuance of commercial paper, the use of unsecured revolving credit facilities, the issuance of equity and other sources. These sources are expected to provide funds required for current operations, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, debt retirements and other capital requirements. The availability and terms under which BHE and each subsidiary has access to external financing depends on a variety of factors, including regulatory approvals, its credit ratings, investors' judgment of risk and conditions in the overall capital markets, including the condition of the utility industry and project finance markets, among other items.\n\u2022Wind generation expenditures include the following:\n\u2022$3,585 higher net income at BHE and Other due to the $3,697 million change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited offset by higher BHE corporate interest expense and unfavorable comparative consolidated state income tax benefits.\n\n\u2022Natural gas transmission and storage includes both growth and operating expenditures. Growth expenditures includes, among other items, the Northern Natural Gas New Lisbon Expansion and Twin Cities Area Expansion projects. Operating expenditures include, among other items, asset modernization and pipeline integrity projects.\nPreferred Stock Issuance\nCollateral and Contingent Features\nRevenue recognized is equal to what the Company has the right to invoice as it corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the Company's performance to date and includes billed and unbilled amounts. The determination of customer invoices is based on a systematic reading of meters, fixed reservation charges based on contractual quantities and rates or, in the case of the Great Britain distribution businesses, when information is received from the national settlement system. At the end of each month, energy provided to customers since the date of the last meter reading is estimated, and the corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded. Unbilled revenue was $750 million as of December 31, 2020. Factors that can impact the estimate of unbilled energy include, but are not limited to, seasonal weather patterns, total volumes supplied to the system, line losses, economic impacts and composition of sales among customer classes. Unbilled revenue is reversed in the following month and billed revenue is recorded based on the subsequent meter readings.\n\u2022$35 million higher net income at BHE Pipeline Group, primarily due to higher transportation revenue; and\nExelon Generation is currently working with PJM and other stakeholders to pursue the FRR option as an alternative to the next PJM capacity auction. If Illinois implements the FRR option, Quad Cities Station could be removed from PJM's capacity auction and instead supply capacity and be compensated under the FRR program. If Illinois cannot implement an FRR program in its PJM zones, then the MOPR will apply to Quad Cities Station, resulting in higher offers for its units that may not clear the capacity market. Implementing the FRR program in Illinois will require both legislative and regulatory changes. MidAmerican Energy cannot predict whether or when such legislative and regulatory changes can be implemented or their potential impact on the continued operation of Quad Cities Station.\n(1) Includes the drawn uncommitted credit facilities totaling $23 million at Northern Powergrid.\nIt is probable the Company's regulated businesses will pass income tax benefits and expense related to the federal tax rate change from 35% to 21% as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, certain property-related basis differences and other various differences on to their customers. As of December 31, 2020, these amounts were recognized as a net regulatory liability of $3.3 billion and will be included in regulated rates when the temporary differences reverse.\nOperating revenue decreased $72 million for 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower gas sales of $89 million at Northern Natural Gas related to system balancing activities (largely offset in cost of sales), partially offset by higher transportation revenue of $19 million. Transportation revenue increased from generally higher volumes and rates, partially offset by the impact of period two rates of $26 million (largely offset in depreciation and amortization expense) and $11 million from refunds related to 2017 Tax Reform at Kern River. Net income increased $35 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the higher transportation revenue, excluding the impact of period two rates, lower property and other tax expense of $9 million due to a non-recurring property tax refund in 2019 and favorable margin of $9 million on system balancing activities, partially offset by higher depreciation and amortization expense, net of the impact of lower depreciation rates at Kern River, due to increased spending on capital projects.\nHistorically, overall inflation and changing prices in the economies where BHE's subsidiaries operate have not had a significant impact on the Company's consolidated financial results. In the United States and Canada, the Regulated Businesses operate under cost-of-service based rate structures administered by various state and provincial commissions and the FERC. Under these rate structures, the Regulated Businesses are allowed to include prudent costs in their rates, including the impact of inflation. The price control formula used by the Northern Powergrid Distribution Companies incorporates the rate of inflation in determining rates charged to customers. BHE's subsidiaries attempt to minimize the potential impact of inflation on their operations through the use of fuel, energy and other cost adjustment clauses and bill riders, by employing prudent risk management and hedging strategies and by considering, among other areas, its impact on purchases of energy, operating expenses, materials and equipment costs, contract negotiations, future capital spending programs and long-term debt issuances. There can be no assurance that such actions will be successful.\n\u25e6MidAmerican Energy is currently planning to construct 483 MWs of additional wind-powered generating facilities, for which the related projects are at varying stages of development. Planned spending for those projects totals $461 million for 2021, $16 million for 2022 and $421 million for 2023.\nEnvironmental Laws and Regulations\nDebt Repurchases\nRefer to Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding the Company's credit facilities, letters of credit, equity commitments and other related items.\nCapital Expenditures\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $6.2 billion and $6.8 billion, respectively. The decrease was primarily due to changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in income tax receipts.\nBHE Transmission\n\nOn November 1, 2020, BHE completed its acquisition of substantially all of the natural gas transmission and storage business of DEI and Dominion Questar, exclusive of the Questar Pipeline Group (the \"GT&S Transaction\"). Under the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement, dated July 3, 2020 (the \"GT&S Purchase Agreement\"), BHE paid approximately $2.5 billion in cash, after post-closing adjustments (the \"GT&S Cash Consideration\"), and assumed approximately $5.6 billion of existing indebtedness for borrowed money, including fair value adjustments.\n\u2022Other capital expenditures includes both growth and operating expenditures, including routine expenditures for generation and other infrastructure needed to serve existing and expected demand, natural gas distribution, technology, and environmental spending relating to emissions control equipment and the management of CCR.\nThe increase in net income attributable to BHE shareholders for 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily due to:\n\u25e6Construction of wind-powered generating facilities at MidAmerican Energy totaling $848 million for 2020, $1,486 million for 2019 and $1,261 million for 2018. MidAmerican Energy placed in-service 729 MWs (nominal ratings) during 2020, including the acquisition of an existing 80-MW wind farm, 1,019 MWs (nominal ratings) during 2019 and 817 MWs (nominal ratings) during 2018. Wind XI, a 2,000-MW project, was completed in January 2020. Wind XII, a 592-MW project, was placed in-service in 2019 and 2020. MidAmerican Energy had three other wind-powered generation projects under construction in 2020 that totaled 319 MWs, including facilities placed in-service in 2020 and the remainder expected to be placed in-service in early 2021. MidAmerican Energy expects all of these wind-powered generating facilities to qualify for 100% of PTCs available. PTCs from these projects are excluded from MidAmerican Energy's Iowa energy adjustment clause until these generation assets are reflected in base rates.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe Company has other types of commitments that arise primarily from unused lines of credit, letters of credit or relate to construction and other development costs (refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources included within this Item 7 and Note 9), uncertain tax positions (refer to Note 12) and AROs (refer to Note 14), which have not been included in the above table because the amount and timing of the cash payments are not certain. Refer, where applicable, to the respective referenced note in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe Company is subject to comprehensive regulation. Refer to the discussion contained in Item 1 of this Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's general regulatory framework and current regulatory matters.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's total net liquidity was as follows (in millions):\nThe Company's historical and forecast capital expenditures consisted mainly of the following:\nThe Company chooses a healthcare cost trend rate that reflects the near and long-term expectations of increases in medical costs and corresponds to the expected benefit payment periods. The healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to gradually decline to 5.00% by 2025, at which point the rate of increase is assumed to remain constant. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for healthcare cost trend rate sensitivity disclosures.\n(1)BHE and Other includes intersegment eliminations.\nOperating revenue decreased $58 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower electricity and natural gas volumes at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC. Net loss remained the same for 2019 compared to 2018 as the change in the after-tax unrealized position of the Company's investment in BYD Company Limited of $156 million was offset by a $134 million income tax benefit recognized in 2018 related to the accrued repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings as a result of 2017 Tax Reform, higher BHE corporate interest expense and lower net income of $14 million at MidAmerican Energy Services, LLC driven by unrealized mark-to-market losses on contracts.\nThe estimate of cash flows arising from the future use of the asset that are used in the impairment analysis requires judgment regarding what the Company would expect to recover from the future use of the asset. Changes in judgment that could significantly alter the calculation of the fair value or the recoverable amount of the asset may result from significant changes in the regulatory environment, the business climate, management's plans, legal factors, market price of the asset, the use of the asset or the physical condition of the asset, future market prices, load growth, competition and many other factors over the life of the asset. Any resulting impairment loss is highly dependent on the underlying assumptions and could significantly affect the Company's results of operations.\nNet income decreased $32 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to an increase in operations and maintenance expense due to higher costs associated with wildfires and the Klamath Hydroelectric Settlement Agreement of $169 million, higher interest expense of $25 million from higher long-term debt balances, higher pension and other postretirement costs of $13 million, lower interest income from lower average interest rates and higher property taxes of $10 million, partially offset by lower tax expense from higher PTCs recognized of $62 million from repowered and new wind-powered generating facilities, higher utility margin of $47 million and higher allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction of $38 million. Utility margin increased primarily due to lower coal-fueled and natural gas-fueled generation costs, lower purchased power costs and price impacts from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower net deferrals of incurred net power costs in accordance with established adjustment mechanisms and lower retail customer volumes.\nNet income increased $45 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher electric utility margin of $100 million, lower pension and post-retirement costs of $9 million and lower income tax expense mainly from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by an increase in operations and maintenance expense, mainly from higher earnings sharing accruals at the Nevada Utilities, and higher depreciation and amortization expense of $20 million, mainly from higher plant placed in-service. Electric utility margin increased primarily due to higher retail customer volumes, price impacts from changes in sales mix and a favorable regulatory decision.\nNet cash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $6,224 million and $6,206 million, respectively. The increase was primarily due to an increase in income tax receipts and improved operating results, partially offset by changes in working capital.\nOperating revenue increased $273 million for 2020 compared to 2019 due to higher retail revenue of $250 million and higher wholesale and other revenue of $23 million. Retail revenue increased primarily due to $234 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain property, plant and equipment and the accelerated amortization of certain regulatory asset balances in relation to Utah and Oregon general rate case orders issued in December 2020. The increase in retail revenue was also due to price impacts of $49 million from changes in sales mix, partially offset by lower customer volumes of $34 million. The increase in wholesale and other revenue was mainly due to $34 million from the amortization of certain existing regulatory balances in Oregon to offset the accelerated depreciation of certain retired wind equipment, partially offset by lower wholesale volumes. Retail customer volumes decreased 1.4% primarily due to the impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in lower industrial and commercial customer usage and higher residential customer usage, partially offset by an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and the favorable impact of weather.\nOperating revenue decreased $7 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the stronger United States dollar of $45 million and lower distributed units of $21 million, partially offset by higher distribution tariff rates of $39 million and higher smart meter revenue of $15 million due to a larger number of units installed. Net income increased $17 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to lower overall pension expense of $23 million, largely resulting from lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2019 compared to 2018, and the higher distribution revenues, partially offset by higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $13 million and the stronger United States dollar of $10 million.\nOperating revenue increased $9 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher distribution revenue of $10 million from increased tariff rates of $40 million, partially offset by 5.4% lower units distributed of $30 million largely due to the impacts of COVID-19. Net income decreased $55 million for 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to write-offs of gas exploration costs of $44 million, higher income tax expense of $37 million and higher distribution-related operating and depreciation expenses of $18 million, partially offset by the higher distribution revenue, lower overall pension expense of $22 million, including lower pension settlement losses recognized in 2020 compared to 2019, and lower interest expense of $9 million. The increase in income tax expense is due to a change in the United Kingdom corporate income tax rate that resulted in a deferred income tax charge of $35 million.\nOn October 5, 2020, DEI and Dominion Questar, as permitted under the terms of the GT&S Purchase Agreement, delivered notice to BHE of their election to terminate the GT&S Transaction with respect to the Questar Pipeline Group and, in connection with the execution of the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement referenced below, to waive the related termination fee under the GT&S Purchase Agreement. Also on October 5, 2020, BHE entered into a second Purchase and Sale Agreement (the \"Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement\") with Dominion Questar providing for BHE's purchase of the Questar Pipeline Group from Dominion Questar (the \"Q-Pipe Transaction\") after receipt of HSR Approval, which is currently anticipated in the first half of 2021, for a cash purchase price of approximately $1.3 billion (the \"Q-Pipe Cash Consideration\"), subject to adjustment for cash and indebtedness as of the closing, and the assumption of approximately $430 million of existing indebtedness for borrowed money. Under the Q-Pipe Purchase Agreement, BHE delivered the Q-Pipe Cash Consideration of approximately $1.3 billion to Dominion Questar on November 2, 2020.\nThe reportable segment financial information includes all necessary adjustments and eliminations needed to conform to the Company's significant accounting policies. The differences between the reportable segment amounts and the consolidated amounts, described as BHE and Other, relate principally to other entities, corporate functions and intersegment

MD&A report:\n\n- Operating revenue increased $1.1 billion or 6% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due to higher revenue at HomeServices from increased mortgage and brokerage activity, higher revenue at BHE Pipeline Group from the GT&S acquisition, and higher revenue at PacifiCorp from regulatory adjustments.\n\n- Net income attributable to BHE shareholders increased $3.9 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This was primarily driven by a $3.7 billion pre-tax unrealized gain on the investment in BYD Company Limited. Excluding this, adjusted net income increased $296 million or 9%.\n\n- The increase in adjusted net income was driven by higher earnings at the utilities, BHE Pipeline Group, BHE Renewables, and HomeServices. This was partially offset by lower earnings at Northern Powergrid from a deferred tax charge.\n\n- Capital expenditures were $7.4 billion in 2020 compared to $8.0 billion in 2019, with the decrease driven by lower spending at the utilities. Key capital projects included investments in wind generation, electric transmission, and natural gas pipelines.\n\n- In 2020, BHE completed the acquisition of Dominion Energy's natural gas transmission and storage business, excluding Questar Pipeline Group, for $2.5 billion. It has an agreement to acquire Questar Pipeline Group for $1.3 billion in 2021. \n\n- Cash flows from operations were $6.2 billion in 2020, comparable to 2019. Cash flows used in investing activities increased due to the Dominion acquisition. Cash from financing increased from debt issuances to fund the acquisition.\n\nSo in summary, BHE delivered higher earnings and operating cash flows in 2020, funded capital investment and acquisitions, and strengthened its natural gas pipeline business."}
