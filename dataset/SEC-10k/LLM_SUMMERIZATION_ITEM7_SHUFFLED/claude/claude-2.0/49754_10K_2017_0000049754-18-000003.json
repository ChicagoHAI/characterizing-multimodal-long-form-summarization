Shortly thereafter, the Company's predecessor began developing and franchising additional restaurants. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1976 with the name IHOP Corp. In November 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Applebee's International, Inc., which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Effective June 2, 2008, the name of the Company was changed to DineEquity, Inc. and on February 20, 2018, the name of the Company was changed to Dine Brands Global, Inc.SM ( Dine Brands Global,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d). Through various subsidiaries (see Exhibit 21, Subsidiaries of Dine Brands Global, Inc.), we own and franchise the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar\u00ae ( Applebee's\u201d) concept in the bar and grill segment within the casual dining category of the restaurant industry, and own, franchise and operate the International House of Pancakes\u00ae ( IHOP\u201d) concept in the family dining category of the restaurant industry. References herein to Applebee's\u00ae and IHOP\u00ae restaurants are to these two concepts, whether operated by franchisees, area licensees or us.\nDomestically, Applebee's and IHOP franchise restaurants are located in all 50 states and two IHOP franchise restaurants are located in the District of Columbia. Internationally, IHOP restaurants are located in three United States territories and 13 countries outside of the United States; Applebee's restaurants are located in two United States territories and 15 countries outside of the United States. With over 3,700 restaurants combined, we believe we are the largest full-service restaurant company in the world. The June 19, 2017 issue of Nation's Restaurant News reported that IHOP and Applebee's were the largest restaurant systems in the family dining and casual dining categories, respectively, in terms of United States system-wide sales during 2016. This marks the tenth consecutive year our two brands have achieved the number one ranking in Nation's Restaurant News.\nWe have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year. For convenience, in this annual report on Form 10-K, we refer to all fiscal years as ending on December 31 and all interim fiscal quarters as ending on March 31, June 30 and September 30 of the respective fiscal year. There were 52 calendar weeks in our 2017 and 2016 fiscal years that ended on December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively, and 53 calendar weeks in our 2015 fiscal year that ended January 3, 2016.\nExecutive Summary of 2017 Results\nOverview\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We incurred a net loss of $330.5 million, due in large part to impairment charges taken in the third quarter of 2017 of $358.2 million for Applebee's goodwill and $173.4 million for Applebee's tradename. The goodwill impairment was not deductible for federal income tax purposes and therefore we received no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment.

The 2017 effective tax rate of 22.3% applied to pretax book loss was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-deductibility of the impairment of Applebee's goodwill for federal income tax purposes, which was partially offset by the income tax benefit resulted from the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the federal tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 15 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nKey Performance Indicators\nIn evaluating the performance of Applebee's and IHOP, we consider the key performance indicators to be the percentage change in system-wide sales, the percentage change in domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales ( domestic same-restaurant sales\u201d) and net franchise restaurant development. Changes in both domestic same-restaurant sales and in the number of Applebee's and IHOP franchise restaurants directly impact the system-wide retail sales that drive our franchise royalty revenues. Restaurant development also impacts franchise revenue in the form of initial franchise fees and, in the case of IHOP restaurants, sales of proprietary pancake and waffle dry mix.\nSystem-wide Sales and Domestic Same-Restaurant Sales\nThe following table sets forth for each of the past three years the number of Effective Restaurants\u201d in the Applebee's and IHOP systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same periods in the prior two years. Sales at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the Company and, as such, the percentage changes in sales presented below are based on non-GAAP sales data. However, we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales, and, where applicable, rental payments under leases that partially may be based on a percentage of their sales. Management also uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants as well as evaluation of current operations.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applebee's Restaurant Data\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Effective Restaurants:(a)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise\n</td> <td>1,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,027\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>System-wide:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic same-restaurant sales change(d)\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic same-restaurant sales change(d)\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic average weekly unit sales (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHOP Restaurant Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Effective Restaurants:(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise\n</td> <td>1,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Area license\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>System-wide:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic same-restaurant sales change(d)\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic same-restaurant sales change(d)\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average weekly unit sales (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Area License:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHOP sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td> Global Effective Restaurants\u201d are the weighted average number of restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period.

The increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic that was partially offset by a decrease in average customer check. We believe the increases in traffic and same-restaurant sales were due, in part, to favorable customer response to marketing initiatives implemented during the quarter, to our revitalized menu offerings and to operational improvements in the quality of the customer experience. Applebee's performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeded that of the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. Based on data from Black Box, the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry experienced a slight increase in same-restaurant sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from an increase in average customer check that was mostly offset by a decline in customer traffic. Applebee's outperformance during the fourth quarter was due primarily to its differential improvement in traffic.\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 5.3%, which was a 200 basis-point improvement over the decrease of 7.3% realized through the first nine months of 2017. The decrease in domestic same-restaurant sales for the full year 2017 was primarily due to a decline in customer traffic, along with a smaller decrease in average customer check. For the full year 2017, Applebee's performance trailed that of the casual dining segment. The casual dining segment's decrease in same-restaurant sales was smaller than Applebee's and was due to a decline in traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average check. As reported by Black Box, the decrease in customer traffic the casual dining segment experienced for the full year 2017 was smaller than the Applebee's decrease in customer traffic, and the casual dining segment experienced an increase in average customer check for the full year 2017 compared to Applebee's decrease in average customer check.\nWe believe the differential between Applebee's performance for the full year 2017 and that of the casual dining segment is due in large part to unsuccessful tactical initiatives previously implemented by Applebee's that have since been addressed and to the inconsistent quality of operations across the Applebee's system. We engaged third-party consultants during the first half of 2017 to assess the continued decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales and to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove the positive sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred approximately $8.6 million of costs related to these stabilization initiatives in 2017.\nIHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 0.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decline in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to a decrease in customer traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average customer check. IHOP customer traffic has declined for nine consecutive quarters, however, the percentage decrease in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the smallest since the first quarter of 2016. We believe the improvement in IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to successful limited-time promotions along with the roll-out of our new IHOP 'N Go\u201d mobile ordering technology. For the full year ended December 31, 2017, IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 1.9%. The decrease for the full year 2017 also was due to a decrease in customer traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average customer check.\nIHOP's performance for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 lagged that of the family dining segment of the restaurant industry. Based on data from Black Box, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the family dining segment had an increase in same-restaurant sales due primarily to an increase in average check that was larger than IHOP's, offset by a decrease in traffic that was also larger than IHOP's. For the full-year 2017, the family dining segment experienced a smaller decrease in same-restaurant sales than IHOP, due primarily to a smaller decrease in traffic than IHOP experienced.\nIn the short term, a decline in customer traffic at either brand may be offset by an increase in average customer check resulting from an increase in menu prices, a favorable change in product sales mix, or a combination thereof. A sustained decline in same-restaurant customer traffic that cannot be offset by an increase in average customer check could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, due to, among other things, reduced royalty revenues, higher bad debt expense resulting from the failure or inability of franchisees to pay amounts owed to us when due, and a possible decline in the number of franchise restaurants because of reduced restaurant development or restaurant closures.\nNet Franchise Restaurant Development\nThe total number of Applebee's franchise restaurants open at December 31, 2017 declined 4% from the number open at December 31, 2016 as franchisees opened 19 new restaurants but closed 99 restaurants. Restaurant closures can occur for a variety of reasons that may differ for each restaurant and for each franchisee. Closures generally fall into one of two categories: restaurants in older locations whose retail, residential and traffic demographics have changed unfavorably over time, and restaurants with non-viable unit economics. The majority of Applebee's restaurant closures in 2017 were due to these factors. While 18 of the restaurants were closed by a single franchisee, no other franchisee had more than 10 restaurant closures.\nIHOP franchisees and area licensees opened 77 restaurants in 2017 and closed 23 restaurants, resulting in net development of 54 restaurants, the highest net development since 2009. The opening of 77 restaurants was the highest annual total of franchise restaurant openings for IHOP since the Current Business Model was adopted in 2004. We believe the IHOP closures were primarily due to natural attrition as the total number of closures in 2017 was only slightly higher than the average annual closure rate of 21 restaurants per year over the three previous years.\nInternationally, franchisees of both brands opened 37 restaurants and closed 22, for net development of 15 restaurants. This international activity is included in the total activity for each brand cited above.\nThe following tables summarize Applebee's and IHOP restaurant development and franchising activity over the past three years: Table 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applebee's Restaurant Development Activity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Summary -

IHOP franchisees are projected to develop between 85 and 100 new IHOP restaurants globally, the majority of which are expected to be domestic openings. We anticipate the closing of between 60 and 80 Applebee's restaurants in 2018 as part of the continuation of a system-wide analysis to optimize the health of the franchisee system. We expect to close between 30 and 40 IHOP restaurants in 2018.\nThe actual number of openings may differ from both our expectations and development commitments. Historically, the actual number of restaurants developed in a particular year has been less than the total number committed to be developed due to various factors, including economic conditions and franchisee noncompliance with development agreements. The timing of new restaurant openings also may be affected by various factors including weather-related and other construction delays, difficulties in obtaining timely regulatory approvals and the impact of currency fluctuations on our international franchisees. The actual number of closures also may differ from our expectations. Our franchisees are independent businesses and decisions to close restaurants can be impacted by numerous factors in addition to changes in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales that are outside of our control, including but not limited to, franchisees' agreements with landlords and lenders.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015\nSignificant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results\nApplebee's has experienced a decline in system-wide sales over the past two years that was primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic. This decline in sales at our franchisees' restaurants has adversely impacted the financial health of some of the franchisees and the timely payment of amounts they owe us for royalty payments and advertising fund contributions. The non-timely payments are primarily concentrated amongst four franchisees. Two franchisees representing approximately 13% of Applebee's 2017 domestic system-wide sales are exhibiting a higher level of financial difficulty than the other franchisees. These franchisee health issues, in turn, had an adverse impact on our 2017 financial results as follows: (i) our bad debt expense increased $11.5 million; (ii) we contributed $9.5 million to the Applebee's NAF to mitigate both the decline in franchisee contributions that are based on a percentage of restaurant sales and the non-timely payment by certain franchisees; and (iii) there was a decrease of $6.2 million in royalty revenue due to uncertainty as to its collectibility. We engaged third-party consultants during the first half of 2017 to assess the continued decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales and to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove the positive sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred approximately $8.6 million of costs related to these stabilization initiatives in 2017.\nThroughout 2017 we addressed franchisee financial health through a collaborative effort between ourselves, a third-party advisor and franchisee representatives. We have considered various forms of assistance to franchisees, such as restaurant closures, assessing franchisee debt arrangements, temporary forbearance on payment obligations, extensions of credit and other support programs. To date, the assistance provided primarily has been the approved closures of non-viable restaurants and waiver of related termination fees, as well as loans to certain franchisees. Applebee's restaurant closures during 2017 reduced our royalty revenue by approximately $4.1 million. Any additional assistance to franchisees may entail incremental costs.\nVirtually all domestic Applebee's franchisees have entered into an amendment to their franchise agreements that will increase their contribution to the Applebee's NAF by 0.25% to 3.50% of their gross sales and decrease their minimum local promotional expenditures to 0.25% of their gross sales for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Such franchisees have also agreed to an incremental temporary increase in the advertising contribution rate, subject to certain contingencies. We will contribute an additional $30 million to the Applebee's NAF during the first six months of 2018.\nWhile we are encouraged by the improvement in Applebee's same-restaurant sales and customer traffic during the fourth quarter of 2017, there can be no assurance that this favorable trend will continue or to what extent any improvement in same-restaurant sales and customer traffic might mitigate the franchisee health issues discussed above. Until such mitigation occurs, we may, in the future, continue to experience relatively high charges for bad debt as a percentage of revenue or be unable to recognize all of the royalty revenue to which we are entitled.\nEvents Impacting Comparability of Financial Information\nImpairment of Applebee's Goodwill and Tradename\nWe performed an interim quantitative test for impairment of Applebee's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of performing the interim quantitative test, we recognized an impairment of Applebee's goodwill of $358.2 million and an impairment of Applebee's tradename of $173.4 million.\nSee additional discussion of these impairments under the heading Financial Review - Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\u201d\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted in December 2017 lowered the Federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we revalued our net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. This revaluation reduced our 2017 net loss by $77.5 million, or $4.37 per share. We also expect to benefit meaningfully from the Tax Act in future periods, primarily due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.\nExecutive Separation Costs\nOn February 17, 2017, we announced the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the former CEO\u201d), effective March 1, 2017. In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement and General Release filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Form 8-K filed on February 17, 2017, we recorded approximately $5.9 million for severance, separation pay and ancillary costs in the first quarter of 2017. All stock options and restricted stock awards held by the former CEO that were unvested at the time of the announcement became vested in connection with the separation. We recorded a charge of approximately $2.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of the equity awards in the first quarter of 2017. Total costs of $8.8 million related to the separation were included in G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nRefranchising of Company-operated Restaurants\nIn June 2017, we refranchised nine of our ten company-operated IHOP restaurants in the Cincinnati, Ohio market area; the one restaurant not refranchised was closed. As a result, we no longer operate any IHOP restaurants on a permanent basis. In July 2015, we refranchised 23 Applebee's company-operated restaurants in the Kansas City, Missouri market area. As of that date, we no longer operated any Applebee's restaurants on a permanent basis.\n53rd week in Fiscal 2015\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year. Every five or six years, our fiscal year contains 53 calendar weeks. Our 2015 fiscal year contained 53 calendar weeks, whereas fiscal 2017 and 2016 each contained 52 calendar weeks. The estimated impact of the 53rd week on fiscal 2015 results of operations was an increase in revenue of $13.8 million, an increase in gross profit of $9.4 million, an increase in income before income taxes of $6.8 million and an increase in cash from operating activities of approximately $6 million. These amounts represent unfavorable variances in the respective line items in comparing 2016 results with 2015 results.\nFinancial Review\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>467.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>484.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>494.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company restaurant operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>604.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(29.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>634.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(47.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>681.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change vs. prior year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur 2017 total revenue declined $29.2 million compared to 2016.

Financing operations revenue primarily consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases. We also sell equipment associated with IHOP franchise restaurants we have reacquired when those restaurants are subsequently refranchised to a new franchisee. Financing expenses are primarily the cost of the restaurant equipment sold.\nThere is a progressive decline in interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as note balances are repaid. As a result of this decline, interest income decreased by $1.2 million between 2017 and 2016 and by $1.1 million between 2016 and 2015. The remaining minor variances in financing revenues and expenses are due to changes in sales and cost of sales of equipment associated with reacquired IHOP franchise restaurants subsequently refranchised to new franchisees. Sales of equipment associated with reacquired IHOP restaurants are, by nature, unpredictable and variable in any given year. The 53rd calendar week in 2015 did not have a significant impact on the comparisons of financing revenues, expenses and gross profit between 2016 and 2015.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions, except number of restaurants)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective Company Restaurants:(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applebee's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHOP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company restaurant sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(9.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company restaurant expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company restaurant segment (loss) profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross loss as % revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Effective Company Restaurants are the weighted average number of company-operated restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for company-operated restaurants open for only a portion of the period.\nAs discussed above under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information,\u201d over the past two years we have refranchised the last company-operated restaurants of both brands. As of December 31, 2017, we do not operate any restaurants. From time to time, we have operated IHOP restaurants reacquired from franchisees on a temporary basis until those restaurants are refranchised and we may reacquire both IHOP and Applebee's restaurants on a temporary basis in the future. There were no restaurants under temporary operation at December 31, 2017.

These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove an increase in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. All other G&A expenses declined $0.6 million, due primarily to a $1.5 million decrease in recruiting and relocation costs, a $1.1 million decrease in professional services and a $1.1 million decrease in conference and travel costs, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in personnel-related costs. The increase in personnel-related costs was primarily due to salary and benefit costs for open management positions that were filled during 2016, partially offset by lower costs of incentive compensation.\nG&A expenses decreased $6.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in personnel-related costs of $6.7 million, in occupancy costs of $1.6 million and in consumer research costs of $0.7 million. Additionally, $1.5 million of the decline was due to additional expenses incurred in the 53rd week of 2015, primarily salaries, benefits and depreciation. The decrease in personnel-related costs is due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs of $7.2 million and lower costs of $1.8 million related to the consolidation of the Kansas City restaurant support center, partially offset by higher full-year costs of stock-based compensation, salary and benefits for several senior management positions that were filled during 2015. The decrease in occupancy costs was primarily due to the consolidation of the Kansas City restaurant support center. These favorable items were offset by higher costs of $3.0 million for professional services and $1.0 million for franchisee conferences.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>358.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(358.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of tradename\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>531.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(531.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe performed a quantitative test for impairment of Applebee's goodwill and tradename as of October 31, 2016, the annual testing date. We identified no impairments as a result of performing these quantitative assessments, however, we did note that the fair value of the Applebee's Franchise Reporting Unit exceeded the carrying value of the unit by 9% and therefore considered the unit to be at risk of impairment.\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we noted that the decline in the market price of our common stock since December 31, 2016, which we had believed to be temporary, persisted throughout the first eight months of 2017 and that the favorable trend in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales experienced in the second quarter of 2017 did not continue into the first two months of the third quarter of 2017. We also noted a continuing increase in Applebee's bad debt expense and in royalties not recognized in income due to uncertainty as to collectibility. Additionally, we also determined an increasing shortfall in franchisee contributions to the Applebee's national advertising fund could require a larger amount of future subsidization in the form of additional franchisor contributions to the fund than previously estimated. Based on these unfavorable developments, we determined that indicators of impairment existed and that an interim test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment should be performed.\nIn determining the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit, we used the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Significant assumptions made by management in estimating fair value under the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales, operating expenses, overhead expenses, depreciation, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, along with an appropriate discount rate based on our estimated cost of equity capital and after-tax cost of debt. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the guideline public company method include the selection of guideline companies and the valuation multiples applied. In determining the fair value of the Applebee's tradename, we used the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales, a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\nThe assumptions used in both the discounted cash flow method and the relief of royalty method are determined by the Company based on historical results, trends and anticipated growth resulting from specific development initiatives planned to be implemented over the time horizon covered by the Company's projections. The most impactful assumptions are the discount rate and the forecasted change in system-wide sales (due to a combination of changes in same-restaurant sales and in net restaurant development) that impact our royalty revenues.\nThere is an inherent degree of uncertainty in preparing any forecast of future results. The projections used in performing the impairment tests reflected an increase in system-wide sales from estimated full-year 2017 amounts, in progressively larger increments, over the time period covered by the projections. System-wide sales are dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's restaurants. Accordingly, there are a number of potential events that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the forecast of system-wide sales, including a decrease in customers' disposable income available for discretionary spending (because of circumstances such as job losses, credit constraints, higher housing costs, changes to tax regulations, energy costs, interest rates or other costs) or a decrease in the perceived wealth of customers (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions). As a result, our business could experience a decline in sales and/or customer traffic as potential customers choose lower-cost alternatives (such as quick-service restaurants) or other alternatives to dining out. Additionally, negative trends in the availability of credit and in expenses such as interest rates and the cost of construction materials could affect our franchisees' ability to maintain and remodel existing restaurants. Any decreases in customer traffic or average customer check due to these or other reasons could reduce gross sales at franchise restaurants, resulting in lower royalty and other payments from franchisees. This could reduce the profitability of franchise restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments owed to us when due (which could adversely impact our current cash flow from franchise operations) and negatively impacting franchisees' ability to develop new restaurants (which could adversely impact our future cash flows from franchise operations).\nAs a result of performing the interim quantitative test, we recognized an impairment of Applebee's goodwill of $358.2 million and an impairment of Applebee's tradename of $173.4 million. After the impairments, the balances of goodwill and the tradename intangible asset allocated to the Applebee's franchise unit as of September 30, 2017 were $328.5 million and $479.0 million, respectively. We adopted the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update 2017-04 on January 1, 2017; accordingly, the amount of the goodwill impairment was determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit that was estimated in the quantitative test. These assets are at risk of additional impairment in the future in the event of sustained downward movement in the Company's stock price, downward revisions of long-term performance assumptions or increases in the assumed long-term discount rate.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) Loss on Disposition of Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn June 2017, we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of nine company-operated IHOP restaurants in the Cincinnati, Ohio market area. As part of the transaction, we entered into an asset purchase agreement, nine franchise agreements and nine sublease agreements for land and buildings. The Company compared the stated rent under the sublease agreements with comparable market rents and recorded net favorable lease assets of $2.3 million in related to the transaction. The Company also received cash of $1.1 million and a note receivable for $4.8 million. After allocating a portion of the consideration to franchise fees and derecognition of the assets sold, we recognized a gain of $6.2 million on the refranchising and sale of the nine restaurants.\nIn July 2015, we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of 23 company-operated Applebee's restaurants in the Kansas City, Missouri market area and we recognized a gain of $2 million on the transaction.

Approximately $0.7 million of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to one IHOP franchise restaurant and one Applebee's restaurant closed during 2016, with the remainder related to adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2016. The substantial majority of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to two IHOP franchise restaurants closed during 2015, partially offset by minor adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2015.\nKansas City Lease Exit Costs\nThe Company incurred costs of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to exit a facility in connection with the consolidation of the Applebee's Kansas City restaurant support center. Of that total, $2.5 million related to the termination of our involvement in a lease covering two floors of the facility and $0.4 million was accrued as the present value of future lease payments, net of assumed sublease rentals, of a portion of one floor of the facility.\nLong-lived Tangible Asset Impairments\nLong-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were insignificant. Long-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 comprised a charge of $0.6 million for one IHOP company-operated restaurant and charges totaling $0.4 million of individually insignificant charges at eight IHOP company-operated restaurants. Long-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to $1.1 million of individually insignificant charges at eight IHOP company-operated restaurants and four Applebee's company-operated restaurants. The Company evaluated the causal factors of all impairments of long-lived assets as they were recorded in each year and concluded they were based on factors specific to each asset and not potential indicators of an impairment of other long-lived assets.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Benefit (Provision)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (provision)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(63.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe income tax provision will vary from period to period for two primary reasons: a change in pretax book income and a change in the effective tax rate. Changes in our pretax book income between 2017 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2015 are addressed in the preceding sections of Results of Operations - Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.\u201d\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxes, including a permanent reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The reduction in the corporate rate requires a one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets and liabilities. As a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of approximately $77.5 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance that allows entities to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the Tax Act. Where we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which our analysis is not yet complete, we recorded provisional amounts in accordance with the guidance. Where we have not yet been able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements of the Tax Act, we have not recorded any amounts related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with the tax laws in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Act.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate of 22.3% applied to pretax book loss was lower than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-deductibility of the impairment of Applebee's goodwill for federal income tax purposes, which partially offsets with the income tax benefit resulted from the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the federal tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 15 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory Federal tax rate.\nThe 2016 effective tax rate of 36.0% applied to pretax book income was higher than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset by applying a lower state tax rate to the deferred tax balances. The 2015 effective tax rate of 37.8% applied to pretax book income was higher than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to state and local income taxes.\nAs of each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined that, based on available evidence, the $1.1 million valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets was warranted due to Massachusetts enacted legislation requiring unitary businesses to file combined reports. As of December 31, 2017, management determined that sufficient positive evidence exists as of the reporting date to conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred taxes of $1.1 million are realizable, and therefore, reduced the valuation allowance accordingly.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Company\nLong-Term Debt\nOn September 30, 2014, Applebee's Funding LLC and IHOP Funding LLC (each a Co-Issuer\u201d), each a special purpose, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, issued $1.3 billion of Series 2014-1 4.277% Fixed Rate Senior Notes, Class A-2 (the Class A-2 Notes\u201d) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Co-Issuers also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2014-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes Class A-1 (the Variable Funding Notes\u201d), which allows for drawings of up to $100 million of Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the Notes.\u201d The Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which substantially all of our domestic revenue-generating assets and our domestic intellectual property, are held by the Co-Issuers and certain other special-purpose, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company (the Guarantors\u201d) that act as guarantors of the Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure the Notes.\nClass A-2 Notes\nThe Notes were issued under a Base Indenture, dated September 30, 2014 (the Base Indenture\u201d) and the related Series 2014-1 Supplement to the Base Indenture, dated September 30, 2014 (the Series 2014-1 Supplement\u201d), among the Co-Issuers and Citibank, N.A., as the trustee (in such capacity, the Trustee\u201d) and securities intermediary. The Base Indenture and the Series 2014-1 Supplement (collectively, the Indenture\u201d) will allow the Co-Issuers to issue additional series of notes in the future subject to certain conditions set forth therein.\nWhile the Notes are outstanding, payment of principal and interest is required to be made on the Class A-2 Notes on a quarterly basis. The quarterly principal payment of $3.25 million on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the leverage ratio for the Company and its subsidiaries is less than or equal to 5.25x. In general, the leverage ratio is our indebtedness divided by adjusted EBITDA for the four preceding quarterly periods. The complete definitions of all calculation elements of the leverage ratio are contained in the Base Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 3, 2014 ( Base Indenture\u201d). Exceeding the leverage ratio of 5.25x does not violate any covenant related to the Notes. As of December 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was 5.70x (See Exhibit 12.1). We made one principal payment of $3.25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and anticipate we will be required to make four quarterly principal payments during 2018.\nWe may voluntarily repay the Class A-2 Notes at any time; however, if we voluntarily repay the Class A-2 Notes prior to September 2018, we would be required to pay a make-whole premium. As of December 31, 2017, the make-whole payment for voluntary repayment was approximately $18 million; this amount declines ratably to zero in September 2018. We would also be subject to a make-whole premium in the event of a mandatory prepayment occurring prior to September 2018 following a Rapid Amortization Event or certain asset dispositions. The make-whole premium requirements are considered derivatives embedded in the Class A-2 Notes that must be bifurcated for separate valuation. We estimated the fair value of these derivatives to be immaterial as of December 31, 2017, based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with either event.\nThe legal final maturity of the Class A-2 Notes is in September 2044, but it is anticipated that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the Class A-2 Notes will be repaid in September 2021 (the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date\u201d). If the Co-Issuers have not repaid or refinanced the Class A-2 Notes prior to the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date, the interest rate on the Class A-2 Notes will increase significantly. Specifically, additional interest will accrue on the Class A-2 Notes equal to the greater of (i) 5.00% per annum and (ii) a per annum interest rate equal to the amount, if any, by which the sum of the following exceeds the Class A-2 Note interest rate: (A) the yield to maturity (adjusted to a quarterly bond-equivalent basis) on the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date of the United States Treasury Security having a term closest to 10 years plus (B) 5.00% plus (C) 2.150%. Additionally, the Company's cash flow would become subject to a rapid amortization event as described below under Covenants and Restrictions.\u201d\nThe Notes are secured by the collateral described below under Guarantees and Collateral.\u201d\nVariable Funding Notes\nIn connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Co-Issuers also entered into a revolving financing facility that allows for the drawings of up to $100 million of Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Variable Funding Notes were issued under the Indenture and allow for drawings on a revolving basis. Drawings and certain additional terms related to the Variable Funding Notes are governed by the Class A-1 Note Purchase Agreement dated as of September 30,\n2014 (the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement\u201d), among the Co-Issuers, the Guarantors, certain conduit investors, financial institutions and funding agents, and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A. ( Rabobank Nederdland\u201d), New York Branch, as provider of letters of credit, as swingline lender and as administrative agent.\nThe Variable Funding Notes will be governed, in part, by the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement and by certain generally applicable terms contained in the Indenture. Depending on the type of borrowing by the Co-Issuers, the applicable interest rate under the Variable Funding Notes is calculated at a per annum rate equal to (a) LIBOR plus 2.50%, (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 0.5% plus (ii) 2.00% or (c) the lenders' commercial paper funding rate plus 2.50%. There is a scaled commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Variable Funding Notes facility of between 50 to 100 basis points. It is anticipated that the principal and interest on the Variable Funding Notes will be repaid in full on or prior to September 2019 (the VFN Anticipated Repayment Date\u201d), subject to two additional one-year extensions at the option of the Company, which acts as the manager (as described below), upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. Following the VFN Anticipated Repayment Date (and any extensions thereof), additional interest will accrue on the Variable Funding Notes equal to 5.00% per annum. The Variable Funding Notes and other credit instruments issued under the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement are secured by the collateral described below under Guarantees and Collateral.\u201d\nThe Variable Funding Notes were undrawn upon issuance on September 30, 2014 and we have not drawn on them since issuance. At December 31, 2017, approximately $3.1 million was pledged against the Variable Funding Notes for outstanding letters of credit, leaving $96.9 million of Variable Funding Notes available for borrowings. The letters of credit are used primarily to satisfy insurance-related collateral requirements.\nGuarantees and Collateral\nUnder the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated September 30, 2014 (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement\u201d), among the Guarantors in favor of the Trustee, the Guarantors guarantee the obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Indenture and related documents and secure the guarantee by granting a security interest in substantially all of their assets.\nThe Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors (collectively, the Securitization Entities\u201d). As of September 30, 2014, these assets (the Securitized Assets\u201d) generally included substantially all of the domestic revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise agreements, area license agreements, development agreements, franchisee fee notes, equipment leases, agreements related to the production and sale of pancake and waffle dry-mixes, owned and leased real property and intellectual property.\nThe Notes are obligations only of the Co-Issuers pursuant to the Indenture and are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. Except as described below, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries, other than the Securitization Entities, guarantee or in any way are liable for the obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Indenture or the Notes.\nCovenants and Restrictions\nThe Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Co-Issuers maintain specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure of the Securitization Entities to maintain the stated debt service coverage ( DSCR\u201d) ratio, the trailing-twelve-month sum of domestic retail sales for all restaurants being below $3.5 billion on quarterly measurement dates, certain manager termination events, certain events of default and the failure to repay or refinance the Notes on the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure of the Securitization Entities to maintain the stated debt service coverage ratio, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties and certain judgments.\nThe DSCR ratio is Net Cash Flow for the four quarters preceding the calculation date divided by the total debt service payments of the preceding four quarters. The complete definitions of the DSCR and all calculation elements are contained in\nthe Base Indenture. Failure to maintain a prescribed DSCR ratio can trigger a Cash Trapping Event, A Rapid Amortization Event, a Manager Termination Event or a Default Event as described below. In a Cash Trapping Event, the Trustee is required to retain a certain percentage of cash flow in a restricted account. In a Rapid Amortization Event, all excess Cash Flow is retained and used to retire principal amounts of debt. Key DSCR ratios are as follows:\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.75x but equal to or greater than 1.50x - Cash Trapping Event, 50% of Net Cash Flow\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.50x - Cash Trapping Event, 100% of Net Cash Flow\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.30x - Rapid Amortization Event\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.20x - Manager Termination Event\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.10x - Default Event\nOur DSCR for the reporting period ended December 31, 2017 was 4.01x (see Exhibit 12.1).\nBased on our current level of operations, we believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our Variable Funding Notes will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during 2018.\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(95.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(139.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(15.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(27.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees, and profit from our rental operations and financing operations. Franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties and franchise fees from Applebee's and IHOP franchised restaurants, IHOP advertising fees and sales of proprietary products by IHOP, each of which fluctuates with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales. Franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of IHOP and Applebee's restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same-restaurant sales. Rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses. Rental income includes revenues from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases. Rental income is impacted by fluctuations in same-restaurant sales as some operating leases include a provision for contingent rent based on retail sales and by a progressive decline in rental income as leases expire. Rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee-operated restaurants. Interest expense on prime capital leases also declines progressively as lease obligations are repaid. Financing operations revenue consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as well as periodic sales of restaurant equipment. Financing income is impacted by a progressive decline in interest revenue as the obligations financed are repaid. Financing expenses are primarily the cost of restaurant equipment.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $52.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Our net income plus the non-cash reconciling items shown in our statements of cash flows (primarily impairment charges, depreciation, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation) decreased $37.3 million from 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in gross profit from Applebee's franchise operations and the increase in G&A expenses discussed in preceding sections of the MD&A. Additionally, net changes in working capital used cash of $27.5 million during 2017 compared to using cash of $12.4 million during 2016. This unfavorable change of $15.1 million primarily resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of $12 million, an increase in current tax assets and liabilities of $8 million and the prepayment of approximately $8 million in rent, partially offset by a decrease in payments of incentive compensation (smaller payments in the first quarter of 2017 of 2016 bonuses compared to first quarter 2016 payments of 2015 bonuses). The increase in accounts receivable was due in part slow payment of receivables by certain Applebee's franchisees.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $17.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Our net income plus the non-cash reconciling items shown in our statements of cash flows (primarily depreciation, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation) was essentially unchanged from 2015. However, net changes in working capital used cash of $12.4 million during 2016 as opposed to providing cash of $4.3 million during 2015. This unfavorable change of $16.8 million primarily resulted from two items unique to 2015 that did not recur in 2016: an increase in collections of gift card receivables due to the 53rd calendar week in fiscal 2015, partially offset by a $10.4 million reduction of interest payable because of payment of an additional two months of interest in 2015 due to our 2014 refinancing of debt.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to $20.5 million of principal receipts from notes, equipment contracts and other long-term receivables partially offset by $13.3 million of capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures compared to 2016 was primarily due to spending in information technology infrastructure projects. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $16 million in fiscal 2018.\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to $18.7 million of principal receipts from notes, equipment contracts and other long-term receivables partially offset by $5.6 million of capital expenditures.\nThe following table represents the timing of principal receipts on various long-term receivables due from our franchisees as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Principal Receipts Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment leases(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Direct financing leases(2)\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise notes(3)\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n________________________________________________\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Equipment lease receivables extend through the year 2029.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Direct financing lease receivables extend through the year 2036.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(3)\n</td> <td>Franchise note receivables extend through the year 2024.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Financing Activities\nFinancing activities used net cash of $95.8 million during 2017. The primary uses of cash in financing activities consisted of cash dividends paid to stockholders totaling $69.8 million, repayments of capital lease obligations of $12.9 million, repurchases of our common stock totaling $10.0 million and a repayment of long-term debt of $3.25 million. These outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $0.2 million related to equity awards. As discussed above under Class A-2 Notes,\u201d we must make a principal payment on long-term debt of $3.25 million each quarter if our leverage ratio is greater than 5.25x. We expect we will be required to make four such payments in 2018.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $137.2 million during 2016. The primary uses of cash in financing activities consisted of cash dividends paid to stockholders totaling $67.4 million, repurchases of our common stock totaling $55.3 million, repayments of capital lease and financing obligations of $14.0 million and a net cash outflow of $0.4 million related to equity awards.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nWe define adjusted free cash flow\u201d for a given period as cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contract receivables, less additions to property and equipment. Management uses this liquidity measure in its periodic assessments of, among other things, the amount of cash dividends per share of common stock and repurchases of common stock and we believe it is important for investors to have the same measure used by management for that purpose. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.\nAdjusted free cash flow is considered to be a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Reconciliation of the cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow is as follows:\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net receipts from notes and equipment receivables\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to property and equipment\n</td> <td>(13.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis non-U.S. GAAP measure is not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the U.S. GAAP information contained within our financial statements.\nThe decrease in adjusted free cash flow in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above and an increase in capital expenditures. The decrease in adjusted free cash flow in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above as well as a decrease in net receipts from notes and equipment receivables as the early payoff of several equipment notes in 2015 did not recur in 2016.\nAt December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $117.0 million, including $57.1 million of cash held for gift card programs and IHOP advertising funds.\nCapital Allocation\nDividends\nDuring the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we declared and paid dividends on common stock as shown in Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nOn February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors approved payment of a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable at the close of business on April 6, 2018 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nShare Repurchases\nIn October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of the Company's common stock (the 2015 Repurchase Program\u201d) on an opportunistic basis from time to time in open market transactions and in privately negotiated transactions based on business, market, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. The 2015 Repurchase Program, as approved by the Board of Directors, does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares and can be terminated at any time. A summary of shares repurchased under the 2015 Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2017 and cumulatively, is as follows:\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2015 Repurchase Program\n</td> <td>Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Cost of shares\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>145,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative repurchases as of December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>1,000,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining dollar value of shares that may be repurchased\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>67.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPlease refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe evaluate dividend payments on common stock and repurchases of common stock within the context of our overall capital allocation strategy with our Board of Directors on an ongoing basis, giving consideration to our current and forecast earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.\nFrom time to time, we also repurchase shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards. Shares are deemed purchased at the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date. See Part II, Item 5 for detail on all share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have obligations for guarantees on certain franchisee lease agreements, as disclosed below in Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d and Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other than such guarantees, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K as of December 31, 2017.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following are our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,324.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,502.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>80.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases(1)\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing obligations(1)\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>103.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized income tax benefits(2)\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum payments\n</td> <td>280.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,468.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,323.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less interest\n</td> <td>(66.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(274.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,413.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,049.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Includes interest calculated on balances as of December 31, 2017 using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\n(2) There is no contractual obligation to pay a specific amount at a specific time.

These letters of credit expire annually, but are typically renewed in the same amount each year unless collateral requirements change.\n(5) In some instances, IHOP and Applebee's may be required to guarantee their purchase of any remaining inventory of certain food and other items purchased by CSCS.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are comprehensively described in Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the accounting policies discussed below are particularly important to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require higher degree of judgment and/or complexity in the preparation of those consolidated financial statements. In exercising those judgments, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Changes in estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow in the future.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and intangible assets considered to have an indefinite life (primarily the Applebee's tradename) are evaluated throughout the year to determine if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in our business, in the business overall climate, unanticipated competition, a\nloss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory developments or a significant decline in the market price of our common stock.\nIf no indicators of impairment have been noted during these preliminary assessments, we perform an assessment of goodwill and intangible assets annually in the fourth fiscal quarter. We first assess qualitatively whether it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment does not exist. Significant factors considered in this assessment include, but are not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, cost considerations, the competitive environment, share price fluctuations, overall financial performance and results of past impairment tests. If we do not qualitatively determine that it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment does not exist, we perform a quantitative impairment test.\nIn determining the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit, we used the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Significant assumptions made by management in estimating fair value under the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales, operating expenses, overhead expenses, depreciation, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, along with an appropriate discount rate based on our estimated cost of equity capital and after-tax cost of debt. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the guideline public company method include the selection of guideline companies and the valuation multiples applied.\nIn the process of a quantitative test, if necessary, of the Applebee's tradename, we primarily use the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales, a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\nThere is an inherent degree of uncertainty in preparing any forecast of future results. The projections used in performing the impairment tests reflected an increase in system-wide sales from estimated full-year 2017 amounts, in progressively larger increments, over the time period covered by the projections. System-wide sales are dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's restaurants. Accordingly, there are a number of potential events that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the forecast of system-wide sales, including a decrease in customers' disposable income available for discretionary spending (because of circumstances such as job losses, credit constraints, higher housing costs, increased tax rates, energy costs, interest rates or other costs) or a decrease in the perceived wealth of customers (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions). As a result, our business could experience a decline in sales and/or customer traffic as potential customers choose lower-cost alternatives (such as quick-service restaurants) or other alternatives to dining out. Additionally, negative trends in the availability of credit and in expenses such as interest rates and the cost of construction materials could affect our franchisees' ability to maintain and remodel existing restaurants. Any decreases in customer traffic or average customer check due to these or other reasons could reduce gross sales at franchise restaurants, resulting in lower royalty and other payments from franchisees. This could reduce the profitability of franchise restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments owed to us when due (which could adversely impact our current cash flow from franchise operations) and negatively impacting franchisees' ability to develop new restaurants (which could adversely impact our future cash flows from franchise operations).\nLong-Lived Assets\nOn a regular basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets (primarily assets related to properties and equipment leased or subleased to franchisees) may not be recoverable. We test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows. Significant factors considered include, but are not limited to, current and forecast sales, current and forecast cash flows, the number of years the franchisee's restaurant has been in operation, its remaining lease life, and other factors which apply on a case-by-case basis. The analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment. Recoverability of the Company's assets is measured by comparing the assets' carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets' remaining useful life or remaining lease term, whichever is less. This process requires the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to a high degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.\nOn a regular basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of intangible assets with finite lives, primarily assets related to Applebee's franchise rights. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparing the assets' carrying value to the discounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the asset's remaining useful life. Significant factors considered include, but are not limited to, current and forecast sales, current and forecast cash flows and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe make judgments as to whether uncertainty as to collectibility of the consideration that we are owed precludes recognition of the revenue on an accrual basis. These judgments are based on the facts specific to each circumstance. Primary factors considered include past payment history and our subjective assessment of the likelihood of receiving payment in the future.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing receivables; however, changes in circumstances relating to receivables may result in additional allowances in the future. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current payment patterns, future obligations and our assessment of the ability to pay outstanding balances. The primary indicator of credit quality is delinquency, which is considered to be a receivable balance greater than 90 days past due. We continually review our allowance for doubtful accounts. Past due balances and future obligations are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nLeases\nOur restaurants are located on (i) sites owned by us, (ii) sites leased by us from third parties and (iii) sites owned or leased by franchisees. For sites owned by or leased by us from third parties, we, in turn, sublease to our franchisees. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP governing the accounting for leases.\nManagement makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease, which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday and/or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with U.S. GAAP governing share-based payments. Accordingly, we measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period using the straight-line method. The fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock-based compensation. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of U.S. GAAP. The measurement of stock-based compensation expense is based on several criteria including, but not limited to, the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate. These inputs are subjective and are determined using management's judgment. If differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future stock-based compensation expense. Any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities. We make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. This test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets. The preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws. When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our income tax expense will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\nFASB ASC Topic 740-10, requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statement when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the position would be\nsustained upon examination by taxing authorities including all appeals or litigation processes, based on its technical merits. A recognized tax position is then measured on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure and adjust all uncertain tax positions based on the available information.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe are subject to various lawsuits, administrative proceedings, audits, and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these lawsuits purport to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Standards Adopted in the Current Fiscal Year\nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a description of accounting standards we adopted in fiscal 2017.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, for a description of newly issued accounting standards that may impact us in the future.", "item_7_truncated": "The assumptions used in both the discounted cash flow method and the relief of royalty method are determined by the Company based on historical results, trends and anticipated growth resulting from specific development initiatives planned to be implemented over the time horizon covered by the Company's projections.

Restaurant closures can occur for a variety of reasons that may differ for each restaurant and for each franchisee. Closures generally fall into one of two categories: restaurants in older locations whose retail, residential and traffic demographics have changed unfavorably over time, and restaurants with non-viable unit economics. The majority of Applebee's restaurant closures in 2017 were due to these factors. While 18 of the restaurants were closed by a single franchisee, no other franchisee had more than 10 restaurant closures.\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHOP Restaurant Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Global Effective Restaurants:(a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise\n</td> <td>1,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Area license\n</td> <td>164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>166\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Company\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>1,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,659\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>System-wide:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic same-restaurant sales change(d)\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Franchise:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic same-restaurant sales change(d)\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average weekly unit sales (in thousands)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Area License:(b)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHOP sales percentage change(c)\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP.

We also noted a continuing increase in Applebee's bad debt expense and in royalties not recognized in income due to uncertainty as to collectibility. Additionally, we also determined an increasing shortfall in franchisee contributions to the Applebee's national advertising fund could require a larger amount of future subsidization in the form of additional franchisor contributions to the fund than previously estimated. Based on these unfavorable developments, we determined that indicators of impairment existed and that an interim test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment should be performed.\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closure and Other Impairment Charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Closure charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Kansas City lease exit costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-lived tangible asset impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total closure and impairment charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIHOP franchisees and area licensees opened 77 restaurants in 2017 and closed 23 restaurants, resulting in net development of 54 restaurants, the highest net development since 2009. The opening of 77 restaurants was the highest annual total of franchise restaurant openings for IHOP since the Current Business Model was adopted in 2004. We believe the IHOP closures were primarily due to natural attrition as the total number of closures in 2017 was only slightly higher than the average annual closure rate of 21 restaurants per year over the three previous years.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt(1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>109.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,324.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,502.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>80.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>109.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases(1)\n</td> <td>20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing obligations(1)\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>103.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrecognized income tax benefits(2)\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total minimum payments\n</td> <td>280.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>319.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,468.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>255.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,323.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less interest\n</td> <td>(66.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(128.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(55.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(274.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>214.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>190.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,413.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,049.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxes, including a permanent reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The reduction in the corporate rate requires a one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets and liabilities. As a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of approximately $77.5 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance that allows entities to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the Tax Act. Where we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which our analysis is not yet complete, we recorded provisional amounts in accordance with the guidance. Where we have not yet been able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements of the Tax Act, we have not recorded any amounts related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with the tax laws in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Act.\nRental revenue declined $1.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in rental income based on a percentage of franchisees' retail sales and the expected progressive decline of $1.2 million in interest income as direct financing leases are repaid. These unfavorable items were partially offset by contractual increases in base sublease rentals revenue. Rental expenses decreased $0.9 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily because of a $1.3 million decline in interest expense as capital lease obligations are repaid and a decline in depreciation expense, partially offset by contractual increases in prime lease expenses.\nWe performed a quantitative test for impairment of Applebee's goodwill and tradename as of October 31, 2016, the annual testing date. We identified no impairments as a result of performing these quantitative assessments, however, we did note that the fair value of the Applebee's Franchise Reporting Unit exceeded the carrying value of the unit by 9% and therefore considered the unit to be at risk of impairment.\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Applebee's goodwill and tradename\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(531.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applebee's franchise operations\n</td> <td>(38.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other operations\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross profit decrease\n</td> <td>(37.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in General and Administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Executive separation costs\n</td> <td>(8.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applebee's stabilization initiatives\n</td> <td>(8.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other G&A\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total G&A increase\n</td> <td>(16.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase in gain on disposition of assets\n</td> <td>7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in income before income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(578.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to $1.2 million of additional expense because of the 53rd calendar week in 2015.\nOn February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors approved payment of a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable at the close of business on April 6, 2018 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(52.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>118.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(17.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>135.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net receipts from notes and equipment receivables\n</td> <td>10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additions to property and equipment\n</td> <td>(13.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted free cash flow\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>63.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(59.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>122.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(19.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nThe following table sets forth for each of the past three years the number of Effective Restaurants\u201d in the Applebee's and IHOP systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same periods in the prior two years.

However, we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales, and, where applicable, rental payments under leases that partially may be based on a percentage of their sales.

There were no restaurants under temporary operation at December 31, 2017. The 53rd calendar week in 2015 did not have a significant impact on the comparisons of restaurant sales, expenses and gross profit between 2016 and 2015.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn determining the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit, we used the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Significant assumptions made by management in estimating fair value under the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales, operating expenses, overhead expenses, depreciation, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, along with an appropriate discount rate based on our estimated cost of equity capital and after-tax cost of debt. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the guideline public company method include the selection of guideline companies and the valuation multiples applied.\n\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Expiration By Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commitments\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease guarantees(3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>313.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Letters of credit(4)\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Food purchases(5)\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>232.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.75x but equal to or greater than 1.50x - Cash Trapping Event, 50% of Net Cash Flow\nAccounting Standards Adopted in the Current Fiscal Year\nCovenants and Restrictions\n\nWhile we are encouraged by the improvement in Applebee's same-restaurant sales and customer traffic during the fourth quarter of 2017, there can be no assurance that this favorable trend will continue or to what extent any improvement in same-restaurant sales and customer traffic might mitigate the franchisee health issues discussed above.

Franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties and franchise fees from Applebee's and IHOP franchised restaurants, IHOP advertising fees and sales of proprietary products by IHOP, each of which fluctuates with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales. Franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of IHOP and Applebee's restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same-restaurant sales. Rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses. Rental income includes revenues from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases. Rental income is impacted by fluctuations in same-restaurant sales as some operating leases include a provision for contingent rent based on retail sales and by a progressive decline in rental income as leases expire. Rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee-operated restaurants. Interest expense on prime capital leases also declines progressively as lease obligations are repaid. Financing operations revenue consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as well as periodic sales of restaurant equipment. Financing income is impacted by a progressive decline in interest revenue as the obligations financed are repaid. Financing expenses are primarily the cost of restaurant equipment.\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>123.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>94.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental operations segment profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit as % revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year.

These amounts represent unfavorable variances in the respective line items in comparing 2016 results with 2015 results.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Applebee's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>IHOP\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales percentage (decrease) increase in domestic system-wide sales\n</td> <td>(6.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net franchise restaurant (reduction) development (1)\n</td> <td>(80\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% (decrease) in domestic same-restaurant sales\n</td> <td>(5.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reported sales (unaudited)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Applebee's domestic franchise restaurant sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,117.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,418.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,711.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHOP franchise restaurant sales\n</td> <td>2,974.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,939.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,948.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IHOP area license restaurant sales\n</td> <td>280.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>282.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>280.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,372.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,641.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,941.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Favorable\n(Unfavorable) Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>358.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(358.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of tradename\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>531.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(531.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Co-Issuers also entered into a revolving financing facility that allows for the drawings of up to $100 million of Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Variable Funding Notes were issued under the Indenture and allow for drawings on a revolving basis. Drawings and certain additional terms related to the Variable Funding Notes are governed by the Class A-1 Note Purchase Agreement dated as of September 30,\nOur 2016 total revenue declined $47.1 million compared to 2015, of which $13.8 million was due to a 53rd calendar week in 2015. Other components of the total change are as follows:\nSystem-wide Sales and Domestic Same-Restaurant Sales\nIn the short term, a decline in customer traffic at either brand may be offset by an increase in average customer check resulting from an increase in menu prices, a favorable change in product sales mix, or a combination thereof. A sustained decline in same-restaurant customer traffic that cannot be offset by an increase in average customer check could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, due to, among other things, reduced royalty revenues, higher bad debt expense resulting from the failure or inability of franchisees to pay amounts owed to us when due, and a possible decline in the number of franchise restaurants because of reduced restaurant development or restaurant closures.\n (c) Sales percentage change\u201d reflects, for each category of restaurants, the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year for all restaurants in that category. The sales percentage change for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was impacted by a 53rd calendar week in fiscal year 2015. \nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to $20.5 million of principal receipts from notes, equipment contracts and other long-term receivables partially offset by $13.3 million of capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures compared to 2016 was primarily due to spending in information technology infrastructure projects. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $16 million in fiscal 2018.\n \u2022 IHOP franchise revenues improved due to increases in effective franchise restaurants due to franchisee development and an increase in sales of pancake and waffle dry mix. These favorable items were primarily offset by a $1.4 million decrease in franchise termination, transfer and extension fees. The 0.1% decrease in IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales did not have a significant impact on the change in 2016 IHOP franchise revenues compared to 2015. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n(1) Global Effective Franchise Restaurants are the weighted average number of franchise restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for franchise restaurants open for only a portion of the period.\n (2) Direct financing lease receivables extend through the year 2036. \nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nLegal Contingencies\nOur 2016 total franchise expenses increased $5.7 million compared to 2015, which included $2.9 million of favorability because of a 53rd calendar week in 2015. Other components of the total change are as follows:\n(1) Effective Company Restaurants are the weighted average number of company-operated restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for company-operated restaurants open for only a portion of the period.\n \u2022 Rental and financing revenues decreased primarily due to the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \nThere is a progressive decline in interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as note balances are repaid. As a result of this decline, interest income decreased by $1.2 million between 2017 and 2016 and by $1.1 million between 2016 and 2015. The remaining minor variances in financing revenues and expenses are due to changes in sales and cost of sales of equipment associated with reacquired IHOP franchise restaurants subsequently refranchised to new franchisees. Sales of equipment associated with reacquired IHOP restaurants are, by nature, unpredictable and variable in any given year. The 53rd calendar week in 2015 did not have a significant impact on the comparisons of financing revenues, expenses and gross profit between 2016 and 2015.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Separation Costs\nKansas City Lease Exit Costs\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nSignificant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results\nIHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 0.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decline in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to a decrease in customer traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average customer check. IHOP customer traffic has declined for nine consecutive quarters, however, the percentage decrease in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the smallest since the first quarter of 2016. We believe the improvement in IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to successful limited-time promotions along with the roll-out of our new IHOP 'N Go\u201d mobile ordering technology. For the full year ended December 31, 2017, IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 1.9%. The decrease for the full year 2017 also was due to a decrease in customer traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average customer check.\nLong-Lived Assets\n \u2022 Company restaurant revenue declined primarily due to the refranchising of nine IHOP company-operated restaurants as noted above under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information.\u201d \nCash provided by operating activities decreased $52.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Our net income plus the non-cash reconciling items shown in our statements of cash flows (primarily impairment charges, depreciation, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation) decreased $37.3 million from 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in gross profit from Applebee's franchise operations and the increase in G&A expenses discussed in preceding sections of the MD&A. Additionally, net changes in working capital used cash of $27.5 million during 2017 compared to using cash of $12.4 million during 2016. This unfavorable change of $15.1 million primarily resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of $12 million, an increase in current tax assets and liabilities of $8 million and the prepayment of approximately $8 million in rent, partially offset by a decrease in payments of incentive compensation (smaller payments in the first quarter of 2017 of 2016 bonuses compared to first quarter 2016 payments of 2015 bonuses). The increase in accounts receivable was due in part slow payment of receivables by certain Applebee's franchisees.\n \u2022 Franchise gross profit declined primarily due to the decrease in revenue described above, an increase in Applebee's bad debt expense and an increase in franchisor contributions to the Applebee's NAF. \nGross profit as a percentage of revenue declined in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily because of the increase in Applebee's bad debt and franchisor contributions to the Applebee's NAF. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily because of the increase in Applebee's franchise expenses as well as the increases in advertising revenue which generated no incremental gross profit, partially offset by favorability in pancake and waffle dry mix.\nLong-Term Debt\nThere is an inherent degree of uncertainty in preparing any forecast of future results. The projections used in performing the impairment tests reflected an increase in system-wide sales from estimated full-year 2017 amounts, in progressively larger increments, over the time period covered by the projections. System-wide sales are dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's restaurants. Accordingly, there are a number of potential events that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the forecast of system-wide sales, including a decrease in customers' disposable income available for discretionary spending (because of circumstances such as job losses, credit constraints, higher housing costs, changes to tax regulations, energy costs, interest rates or other costs) or a decrease in the perceived wealth of customers (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions). As a result, our business could experience a decline in sales and/or customer traffic as potential customers choose lower-cost alternatives (such as quick-service restaurants) or other alternatives to dining out. Additionally, negative trends in the availability of credit and in expenses such as interest rates and the cost of construction materials could affect our franchisees' ability to maintain and remodel existing restaurants. Any decreases in customer traffic or average customer check due to these or other reasons could reduce gross sales at franchise restaurants, resulting in lower royalty and other payments from franchisees. This could reduce the profitability of franchise restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments owed to us when due (which could adversely impact our current cash flow from franchise operations) and negatively impacting franchisees' ability to develop new restaurants (which could adversely impact our future cash flows from franchise operations).\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.30x - Rapid Amortization Event\n (a) Global Effective Restaurants\u201d are the weighted average number of restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period. Information is presented for all Effective Restaurants in the Applebee's and IHOP systems, domestic and international, which includes restaurants owned by franchisees and area licensees as well as those owned by the Company. \n_________________________________\nShare Repurchases\nApproximately $2.2 million of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to one IHOP company-operated restaurant closed during 2017, with the remainder primarily related to adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2017. Approximately $0.7 million of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to one IHOP franchise restaurant and one Applebee's restaurant closed during 2016, with the remainder related to adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2016. The substantial majority of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to two IHOP franchise restaurants closed during 2015, partially offset by minor adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2015.\nIn June 2017, we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of nine company-operated IHOP restaurants in the Cincinnati, Ohio market area. As part of the transaction, we entered into an asset purchase agreement, nine franchise agreements and nine sublease agreements for land and buildings. The Company compared the stated rent under the sublease agreements with comparable market rents and recorded net favorable lease assets of $2.3 million in related to the transaction. The Company also received cash of $1.1 million and a note receivable for $4.8 million. After allocating a portion of the consideration to franchise fees and derecognition of the assets sold, we recognized a gain of $6.2 million on the refranchising and sale of the nine restaurants.\nThroughout 2017 we addressed franchisee financial health through a collaborative effort between ourselves, a third-party advisor and franchisee representatives. We have considered various forms of assistance to franchisees, such as restaurant closures, assessing franchisee debt arrangements, temporary forbearance on payment obligations, extensions of credit and other support programs. To date, the assistance provided primarily has been the approved closures of non-viable restaurants and waiver of related termination fees, as well as loans to certain franchisees. Applebee's restaurant closures during 2017 reduced our royalty revenue by approximately $4.1 million. Any additional assistance to franchisees may entail incremental costs.\n \u2022 We incurred a net loss of $330.5 million, due in large part to impairment charges taken in the third quarter of 2017 of $358.2 million for Applebee's goodwill and $173.4 million for Applebee's tradename. The goodwill impairment was not deductible for federal income tax purposes and therefore we received no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment. We did recognize a deferred tax benefit of $65.1 million related to the impairment charge for Applebee's tradename; \nIHOP's performance for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 lagged that of the family dining segment of the restaurant industry. Based on data from Black Box, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the family dining segment had an increase in same-restaurant sales due primarily to an increase in average check that was larger than IHOP's, offset by a decrease in traffic that was also larger than IHOP's. For the full-year 2017, the family dining segment experienced a smaller decrease in same-restaurant sales than IHOP, due primarily to a smaller decrease in traffic than IHOP experienced.\nThere is an inherent degree of uncertainty in preparing any forecast of future results. The projections used in performing the impairment tests reflected an increase in system-wide sales from estimated full-year 2017 amounts, in progressively larger increments, over the time period covered by the projections. System-wide sales are dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's restaurants.

This could reduce the profitability of franchise restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments owed to us when due (which could adversely impact our current cash flow from franchise operations) and negatively impacting franchisees' ability to develop new restaurants (which could adversely impact our future cash flows from franchise operations).\nFASB ASC Topic 740-10, requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statement when it is more likely than not (i.e. a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the position would be\nIn June 2017, we refranchised nine of our ten company-operated IHOP restaurants in the Cincinnati, Ohio market area; the one restaurant not refranchised was closed. As a result, we no longer operate any IHOP restaurants on a permanent basis. In July 2015, we refranchised 23 Applebee's company-operated restaurants in the Kansas City, Missouri market area. As of that date, we no longer operated any Applebee's restaurants on a permanent basis.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow is considered to be a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Reconciliation of the cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow is as follows:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing receivables; however, changes in circumstances relating to receivables may result in additional allowances in the future. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current payment patterns, future obligations and our assessment of the ability to pay outstanding balances. The primary indicator of credit quality is delinquency, which is considered to be a receivable balance greater than 90 days past due. We continually review our allowance for doubtful accounts. Past due balances and future obligations are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nKey Performance Indicators\n\n \u2022 Company-operated restaurant gross profit improved slightly due to the refranchising of nine IHOP company-operated restaurants noted above. \nDividends\nInternationally, franchisees of both brands opened 37 restaurants and closed 22, for net development of 15 restaurants. This international activity is included in the total activity for each brand cited above.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nAs a result of performing the interim quantitative test, we recognized an impairment of Applebee's goodwill of $358.2 million and an impairment of Applebee's tradename of $173.4 million. After the impairments, the balances of goodwill and the tradename intangible asset allocated to the Applebee's franchise unit as of September 30, 2017 were $328.5 million and $479.0 million, respectively. We adopted the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update 2017-04 on January 1, 2017; accordingly, the amount of the goodwill impairment was determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit that was estimated in the quantitative test. These assets are at risk of additional impairment in the future in the event of sustained downward movement in the Company's stock price, downward revisions of long-term performance assumptions or increases in the assumed long-term discount rate.\n________________________________________\nOperating Activities\n (d) Domestic same-restaurant sales change\u201d reflects the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal year, compared to the same weeks in the prior year, for domestic restaurants that have been operated throughout both fiscal years that are being compared and have been open for at least 18 months. Because of new unit openings and restaurant closures, the domestic restaurants open throughout the fiscal years being compared may be different from year to year. Domestic same-restaurant sales percentage change does not include data on IHOP area license restaurants. \nThe Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors (collectively, the Securitization Entities\u201d). As of September 30, 2014, these assets (the Securitized Assets\u201d) generally included substantially all of the domestic revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise agreements, area license agreements, development agreements, franchisee fee notes, equipment leases, agreements related to the production and sale of pancake and waffle dry-mixes, owned and leased real property and intellectual property.\n\nClass A-2 Notes\nWe define adjusted free cash flow\u201d for a given period as cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contract receivables, less additions to property and equipment. Management uses this liquidity measure in its periodic assessments of, among other things, the amount of cash dividends per share of common stock and repurchases of common stock and we believe it is important for investors to have the same measure used by management for that purpose. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.\nApplebee's National Advertising Fund (the Applebee's NAF\u201d) to mitigate the decline in franchisee contributions that are based on a percentage of restaurant sales; a $6.2 million decrease in royalty revenue because of uncertainty as to collectibility; and a $4.1 million decrease in royalty revenue due to restaurant closures. An additional $8.3 million of the total decline was due to a 5.3% decrease in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales;\n\nOur 2017 total franchise expenses increased $19.5 million compared to 2016. The significant components of the total change are as follows:\nLong-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were insignificant. Long-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 comprised a charge of $0.6 million for one IHOP company-operated restaurant and charges totaling $0.4 million of individually insignificant charges at eight IHOP company-operated restaurants. Long-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to $1.1 million of individually insignificant charges at eight IHOP company-operated restaurants and four Applebee's company-operated restaurants. The Company evaluated the causal factors of all impairments of long-lived assets as they were recorded in each year and concluded they were based on factors specific to each asset and not potential indicators of an impairment of other long-lived assets.\n\nRental operations relate primarily to IHOP franchise restaurants that were developed under the Previous IHOP Business Model described under Item 1. - Business. Rental income includes revenue from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases. Rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on certain franchise restaurants.\n \u2022 Franchise revenues decreased due to a 5.3% decline in Applebee's same-restaurant sales, an increase in Applebee's revenue we did not recognize due to uncertainty as to collectibility, an increase in closures of Applebee's restaurants, and a decrease in sales of IHOP pancake and waffle dry mix. These unfavorable items were partially offset by new restaurant development by IHOP franchisees. \nVirtually all domestic Applebee's franchisees have entered into an amendment to their franchise agreements that will increase their contribution to the Applebee's NAF by 0.25% to 3.50% of their gross sales and decrease their minimum local promotional expenditures to 0.25% of their gross sales for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Such franchisees have also agreed to an incremental temporary increase in the advertising contribution rate, subject to certain contingencies. We will contribute an additional $30 million to the Applebee's NAF during the first six months of 2018.\n(1) Franchise and area license restaurant openings, net of closings\n (3) Franchise note receivables extend through the year 2024.  Financing Activities\nOn a regular basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets (primarily assets related to properties and equipment leased or subleased to franchisees) may not be recoverable. We test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows. Significant factors considered include, but are not limited to, current and forecast sales, current and forecast cash flows, the number of years the franchisee's restaurant has been in operation, its remaining lease life, and other factors which apply on a case-by-case basis. The analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment. Recoverability of the Company's assets is measured by comparing the assets' carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets' remaining useful life or remaining lease term, whichever is less. This process requires the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to a high degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.\nFrom time to time, we also repurchase shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards. Shares are deemed purchased at the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date. See Part II, Item 5 for detail on all share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $117.0 million, including $57.1 million of cash held for gift card programs and IHOP advertising funds.\nThis non-U.S. GAAP measure is not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the U.S. GAAP information contained within our financial statements.\nOur restaurants are located on (i) sites owned by us, (ii) sites leased by us from third parties and (iii) sites owned or leased by franchisees. For sites owned by or leased by us from third parties, we, in turn, sublease to our franchisees. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP governing the accounting for leases.\n\n \u2022 IHOP franchise expenses improved due to favorability in pancake and dry mix purchases. \nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, for a description of newly issued accounting standards that may impact us in the future.\n \u2022 IHOP franchisees opened 77 new restaurants worldwide, with net development of 54 restaurants. The opening of 77 restaurants was the highest annual total of franchise restaurant openings for IHOP since the Current Business Model was adopted in 2004. Applebee's franchisees closed 99 restaurants worldwide, with a net reduction of 80 restaurants. Taken together, the total number of our restaurants declined by less than 1% from last year's total; and \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Notes are obligations only of the Co-Issuers pursuant to the Indenture and are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. Except as described below, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries, other than the Securitization Entities, guarantee or in any way are liable for the obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Indenture or the Notes.\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.50x - Cash Trapping Event, 100% of Net Cash Flow\nDuring 2018, we expect Applebee's franchisees to develop between 10 and 15 new restaurants globally, the majority of which are expected to be international openings. IHOP franchisees are projected to develop between 85 and 100 new IHOP restaurants globally, the majority of which are expected to be domestic openings. We anticipate the closing of between 60 and 80 Applebee's restaurants in 2018 as part of the continuation of a system-wide analysis to optimize the health of the franchisee system. We expect to close between 30 and 40 IHOP restaurants in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) of 22% for the year ended December 31, 2017 was significantly different than both the federal statutory rate of 35% and the ETR of 36% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate of 22.3% applied to pretax book loss was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-deductibility of the impairment of Applebee's goodwill for federal income tax purposes, which was partially offset by the income tax benefit resulted from the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the federal tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 15 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a description of accounting standards we adopted in fiscal 2017.\nNet Franchise Restaurant Development\nAs of each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined that, based on available evidence, the $1.1 million valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets was warranted due to Massachusetts enacted legislation requiring unitary businesses to file combined reports. As of December 31, 2017, management determined that sufficient positive evidence exists as of the reporting date to conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred taxes of $1.1 million are realizable, and therefore, reduced the valuation allowance accordingly.\nThe Variable Funding Notes will be governed, in part, by the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement and by certain generally applicable terms contained in the Indenture. Depending on the type of borrowing by the Co-Issuers, the applicable interest rate under the Variable Funding Notes is calculated at a per annum rate equal to (a) LIBOR plus 2.50%, (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 0.5% plus (ii) 2.00% or (c) the lenders' commercial paper funding rate plus 2.50%. There is a scaled commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Variable Funding Notes facility of between 50 to 100 basis points. It is anticipated that the principal and interest on the Variable Funding Notes will be repaid in full on or prior to September 2019 (the VFN Anticipated Repayment Date\u201d), subject to two additional one-year extensions at the option of the Company, which acts as the manager (as described below), upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. Following the VFN Anticipated Repayment Date (and any extensions thereof), additional interest will accrue on the Variable Funding Notes equal to 5.00% per annum. The Variable Funding Notes and other credit instruments issued under the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement are secured by the collateral described below under Guarantees and Collateral.\u201d\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 5.3%, which was a 200 basis-point improvement over the decrease of 7.3% realized through the first nine months of 2017. The decrease in domestic same-restaurant sales for the full year 2017 was primarily due to a decline in customer traffic, along with a smaller decrease in average customer check. For the full year 2017, Applebee's performance trailed that of the casual dining segment. The casual dining segment's decrease in same-restaurant sales was smaller than Applebee's and was due to a decline in traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average check. As reported by Black Box, the decrease in customer traffic the casual dining segment experienced for the full year 2017 was smaller than the Applebee's decrease in customer traffic, and the casual dining segment experienced an increase in average customer check for the full year 2017 compared to Applebee's decrease in average customer check.\nUnder the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated September 30, 2014 (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement\u201d), among the Guarantors in favor of the Trustee, the Guarantors guarantee the obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Indenture and related documents and secure the guarantee by granting a security interest in substantially all of their assets.\n\nPlease refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGuarantees and Collateral\n \u2022 We returned nearly $80 million to our stockholders, comprised of $69.8 million in cash dividends and $10.0 million in the form of stock repurchases; \nVariable Funding Notes\nWe believe the differential between Applebee's performance for the full year 2017 and that of the casual dining segment is due in large part to unsuccessful tactical initiatives previously implemented by Applebee's that have since been addressed and to the inconsistent quality of operations across the Applebee's system. We engaged third-party consultants during the first half of 2017 to assess the continued decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales and to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove the positive sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred approximately $8.6 million of costs related to these stabilization initiatives in 2017.\nGeneral\nThe following table represents the timing of principal receipts on various long-term receivables due from our franchisees as of December 31, 2017:\nloss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory developments or a significant decline in the market price of our common stock.\n \u2022 Rental and financing gross profit was adversely impacted by the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \nApplebee's domestic same-restaurant sales increased 1.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from the same period in 2016, the first quarterly increase in two and one-half years. The increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic that was partially offset by a decrease in average customer check. We believe the increases in traffic and same-restaurant sales were due, in part, to favorable customer response to marketing initiatives implemented during the quarter, to our revitalized menu offerings and to operational improvements in the quality of the customer experience. Applebee's performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeded that of the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. Based on data from Black Box, the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry experienced a slight increase in same-restaurant sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from an increase in average customer check that was mostly offset by a decline in customer traffic. Applebee's outperformance during the fourth quarter was due primarily to its differential improvement in traffic.\n \u2022 We generated cash provided by operating activities of approximately $66 million and adjusted free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contract receivables, less additions to property and equipment) of approximately $63 million in 2017; \nConsolidated Results of Operations - Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015\n\nThe 2016 effective tax rate of 36.0% applied to pretax book income was higher than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset by applying a lower state tax rate to the deferred tax balances. The 2015 effective tax rate of 37.8% applied to pretax book income was higher than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to state and local income taxes.\nRefranchising of Company-operated Restaurants\nCapital Allocation\nFinancial Review\nThe actual number of openings may differ from both our expectations and development commitments. Historically, the actual number of restaurants developed in a particular year has been less than the total number committed to be developed due to various factors, including economic conditions and franchisee noncompliance with development agreements. The timing of new restaurant openings also may be affected by various factors including weather-related and other construction delays, difficulties in obtaining timely regulatory approvals and the impact of currency fluctuations on our international franchisees. The actual number of closures also may differ from our expectations. Our franchisees are independent businesses and decisions to close restaurants can be impacted by numerous factors in addition to changes in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales that are outside of our control, including but not limited to, franchisees' agreements with landlords and lenders.\nWe are subject to various lawsuits, administrative proceedings, audits, and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these lawsuits purport to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe decrease in adjusted free cash flow in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above and an increase in capital expenditures. The decrease in adjusted free cash flow in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above as well as a decrease in net receipts from notes and equipment receivables as the early payoff of several equipment notes in 2015 did not recur in 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Company\n \u2022 Advertising revenues increased due to the IHOP restaurant development noted above. \nOn February 17, 2017, we announced the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the former CEO\u201d), effective March 1, 2017. In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement and General Release filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Form 8-K filed on February 17, 2017, we recorded approximately $5.9 million for severance, separation pay and ancillary costs in the first quarter of 2017. All stock options and restricted stock awards held by the former CEO that were unvested at the time of the announcement became vested in connection with the separation. We recorded a charge of approximately $2.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of the equity awards in the first quarter of 2017. Total costs of $8.8 million related to the separation were included in G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Company restaurant revenue declined primarily due to the refranchising of 23 Applebee's restaurants as noted under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information.\u201d \nWe have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year. For convenience, in this annual report on Form 10-K, we refer to all fiscal years as ending on December 31 and all interim fiscal quarters as ending on March 31, June 30 and September 30 of the respective fiscal year. There were 52 calendar weeks in our 2017 and 2016 fiscal years that ended on December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively, and 53 calendar weeks in our 2015 fiscal year that ended January 3, 2016.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $137.2 million during 2016. The primary uses of cash in financing activities consisted of cash dividends paid to stockholders totaling $67.4 million, repurchases of our common stock totaling $55.3 million, repayments of capital lease and financing obligations of $14.0 million and a net cash outflow of $0.4 million related to equity awards.\nThe legal final maturity of the Class A-2 Notes is in September 2044, but it is anticipated that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the Class A-2 Notes will be repaid in September 2021 (the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date\u201d). If the Co-Issuers have not repaid or refinanced the Class A-2 Notes prior to the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date, the interest rate on the Class A-2 Notes will increase significantly. Specifically, additional interest will accrue on the Class A-2 Notes equal to the greater of (i) 5.00% per annum and (ii) a per annum interest rate equal to the amount, if any, by which the sum of the following exceeds the Class A-2 Note interest rate: (A) the yield to maturity (adjusted to a quarterly bond-equivalent basis) on the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date of the United States Treasury Security having a term closest to 10 years plus (B) 5.00% plus (C) 2.150%. Additionally, the Company's cash flow would become subject to a rapid amortization event as described below under Covenants and Restrictions.\u201d\nThe Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Co-Issuers maintain specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure of the Securitization Entities to maintain the stated debt service coverage ( DSCR\u201d) ratio, the trailing-twelve-month sum of domestic retail sales for all restaurants being below $3.5 billion on quarterly measurement dates, certain manager termination events, certain events of default and the failure to repay or refinance the Notes on the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure of the Securitization Entities to maintain the stated debt service coverage ratio, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties and certain judgments.\nStatements contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Shortly thereafter, the Company's predecessor began developing and franchising additional restaurants. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1976 with the name IHOP Corp. In November 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Applebee's International, Inc., which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Effective June 2, 2008, the name of the Company was changed to DineEquity, Inc. and on February 20, 2018, the name of the Company was changed to Dine Brands Global, Inc.SM ( Dine Brands Global,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d). Through various subsidiaries (see Exhibit 21, Subsidiaries of Dine Brands Global, Inc.), we own and franchise the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar\u00ae ( Applebee's\u201d) concept in the bar and grill segment within the casual dining category of the restaurant industry, and own, franchise and operate the International House of Pancakes\u00ae ( IHOP\u201d) concept in the family dining category of the restaurant industry. References herein to Applebee's\u00ae and IHOP\u00ae restaurants are to these two concepts, whether operated by franchisees, area licensees or us.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets primarily relates to franchising rights arising from the November 2007 acquisition of Applebee's. See Note 6 - Other Intangible Assets, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe income tax provision will vary from period to period for two primary reasons: a change in pretax book income and a change in the effective tax rate. Changes in our pretax book income between 2017 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2015 are addressed in the preceding sections of Results of Operations - Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.\u201d\n53rd week in Fiscal 2015\n \u2022 IHOP franchisees remodeled 320 domestic restaurants in 2017 under our new Rise N' Shine design. A total of 620 restaurants have been remodeled since the Rise N' Shine design was announced in late 2015.  Key Performance Indicators\nThe following tables summarize Applebee's and IHOP restaurant development and franchising activity over the past three years: \nStock-Based Compensation\n\nIn July 2015, we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of 23 company-operated Applebee's restaurants in the Kansas City, Missouri market area and we recognized a gain of $2 million on the transaction. There were no other individually significant gains or losses on dispositions of assets during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to $18.7 million of principal receipts from notes, equipment contracts and other long-term receivables partially offset by $5.6 million of capital expenditures.\nThe Notes are secured by the collateral described below under Guarantees and Collateral.\u201d\nWe provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities. We make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.\n\nOur DSCR for the reporting period ended December 31, 2017 was 4.01x (see Exhibit 12.1).\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted in December 2017 lowered the Federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we revalued our net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. This revaluation reduced our 2017 net loss by $77.5 million, or $4.37 per share. We also expect to benefit meaningfully from the Tax Act in future periods, primarily due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.\n \u2022 Advertising revenues increased due to the IHOP restaurant development noted above and an increase in the number of international restaurants of both brands participating in advertising funds. \nRevenue Recognition\nOur 2017 total franchise revenue declined $16.9 million compared to 2016. The significant components of the total change are as follows:\n2014 (the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement\u201d), among the Co-Issuers, the Guarantors, certain conduit investors, financial institutions and funding agents, and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A. ( Rabobank Nederdland\u201d), New York Branch, as provider of letters of credit, as swingline lender and as administrative agent.\nGoodwill and intangible assets considered to have an indefinite life (primarily the Applebee's tradename) are evaluated throughout the year to determine if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in our business, in the business overall climate, unanticipated competition, a\nG&A expenses decreased $6.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in personnel-related costs of $6.7 million, in occupancy costs of $1.6 million and in consumer research costs of $0.7 million. Additionally, $1.5 million of the decline was due to additional expenses incurred in the 53rd week of 2015, primarily salaries, benefits and depreciation. The decrease in personnel-related costs is due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs of $7.2 million and lower costs of $1.8 million related to the consolidation of the Kansas City restaurant support center, partially offset by higher full-year costs of stock-based compensation, salary and benefits for several senior management positions that were filled during 2015. The decrease in occupancy costs was primarily due to the consolidation of the Kansas City restaurant support center. These favorable items were offset by higher costs of $3.0 million for professional services and $1.0 million for franchisee conferences.\n \u2022 Rental and financing gross profit was adversely impacted by the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \n \u2022 Company-operated restaurant gross profit declined primarily due to the refranchising of 23 Applebee's company-operated restaurants noted above. \n(5) In some instances, IHOP and Applebee's may be required to guarantee their purchase of any remaining inventory of certain food and other items purchased by CSCS.\nThe following are our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\n(2) There is no contractual obligation to pay a specific amount at a specific time. The amounts shown above represent our current best estimate of the timing as to settlement with a taxing authority or lapse of statutes of limitation.\nG&A expenses increased $16.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to charges of $8.8 million related to the executive separation costs discussed above under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information.\u201d Additionally, we incurred $8.6 million of costs related to Applebee's stabilization initiatives, primarily costs of third-party consultants engaged to assess the decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales, to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove an increase in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. All other G&A expenses declined $0.6 million, due primarily to a $1.5 million decrease in recruiting and relocation costs, a $1.1 million decrease in professional services and a $1.1 million decrease in conference and travel costs, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in personnel-related costs. The increase in personnel-related costs was primarily due to salary and benefit costs for open management positions that were filled during 2016, partially offset by lower costs of incentive compensation.\nInterest Expense\nOur 2016 gross profit decreased $19.6 million compared to 2015, of which $9.4 million was due to a 53rd calendar week in 2015. Other components of the total change are as follows:\n \u2022 Applebee's franchise revenue decreased almost $20 million. A 5.3% decrease in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales reduced revenue by $8.3 million and there was a decrease of $6.2 million of royalty revenue due to uncertainty as to its collectibility. Restaurant closures reduced revenue by $4.1 million. Lower franchise termination and transfer fees also contributed to the decrease. \n \u2022 Franchise gross profit declined primarily due to a 5.0% decrease in Applebee's domestic franchise same-restaurant sales as well as lower franchise, extension and termination fees from both brands. These unfavorable items were partially offset by IHOP restaurant development and favorability in pancake and waffle dry mix. \nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with U.S. GAAP governing share-based payments. Accordingly, we measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period using the straight-line method. The fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock-based compensation. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of U.S. GAAP. The measurement of stock-based compensation expense is based on several criteria including, but not limited to, the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate. These inputs are subjective and are determined using management's judgment. If differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future stock-based compensation expense. Any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods.\nEvents Impacting Comparability of Financial Information\nsustained upon examination by taxing authorities including all appeals or litigation processes, based on its technical merits. A recognized tax position is then measured on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure and adjust all uncertain tax positions based on the available information.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $95.8 million during 2017. The primary uses of cash in financing activities consisted of cash dividends paid to stockholders totaling $69.8 million, repayments of capital lease obligations of $12.9 million, repurchases of our common stock totaling $10.0 million and a repayment of long-term debt of $3.25 million. These outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $0.2 million related to equity awards. As discussed above under Class A-2 Notes,\u201d we must make a principal payment on long-term debt of $3.25 million each quarter if our leverage ratio is greater than 5.25x. We expect we will be required to make four such payments in 2018.\n \u2022 IHOP franchise expenses improved due primarily to favorability in pancake and waffle dry mix purchases partially offset by a $0.8 million franchisor contribution to the IHOP national advertising fund. \nDuring the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we declared and paid dividends on common stock as shown in Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n\nWe may voluntarily repay the Class A-2 Notes at any time; however, if we voluntarily repay the Class A-2 Notes prior to September 2018, we would be required to pay a make-whole premium. As of December 31, 2017, the make-whole payment for voluntary repayment was approximately $18 million; this amount declines ratably to zero in September 2018. We would also be subject to a make-whole premium in the event of a mandatory prepayment occurring prior to September 2018 following a Rapid Amortization Event or certain asset dispositions. The make-whole premium requirements are considered derivatives embedded in the Class A-2 Notes that must be bifurcated for separate valuation. We estimated the fair value of these derivatives to be immaterial as of December 31, 2017, based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with either event.\nImpairment of Applebee's Goodwill and Tradename\nIn the process of a quantitative test, if necessary, of the Applebee's tradename, we primarily use the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales, a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\nOn a regular basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of intangible assets with finite lives, primarily assets related to Applebee's franchise rights. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparing the assets' carrying value to the discounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the asset's remaining useful life. Significant factors considered include, but are not limited to, current and forecast sales, current and forecast cash flows and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.10x - Default Event\n \u2022 Increased franchise revenues due to IHOP restaurant development and sales of pancake and waffle dry mix were offset by a decrease in Applebee's franchise royalties primarily due to a 5.0% decline in same-restaurant sales and to lower franchise, extension and termination fees from both brands. \nApplebee's has experienced a decline in system-wide sales over the past two years that was primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic. This decline in sales at our franchisees' restaurants has adversely impacted the financial health of some of the franchisees and the timely payment of amounts they owe us for royalty payments and advertising fund contributions. The non-timely payments are primarily concentrated amongst four franchisees. Two franchisees representing approximately 13% of Applebee's 2017 domestic system-wide sales are exhibiting a higher level of financial difficulty than the other franchisees. These franchisee health issues, in turn, had an adverse impact on our 2017 financial results as follows: (i) our bad debt expense increased $11.5 million; (ii) we contributed $9.5 million to the Applebee's NAF to mitigate both the decline in franchisee contributions that are based on a percentage of restaurant sales and the non-timely payment by certain franchisees; and (iii) there was a decrease of $6.2 million in royalty revenue due to uncertainty as to its collectibility. We engaged third-party consultants during the first half of 2017 to assess the continued decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales and to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove the positive sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred approximately $8.6 million of costs related to these stabilization initiatives in 2017.\nOn September 30, 2014, Applebee's Funding LLC and IHOP Funding LLC (each a Co-Issuer\u201d), each a special purpose, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, issued $1.3 billion of Series 2014-1 4.277% Fixed Rate Senior Notes, Class A-2 (the Class A-2 Notes\u201d) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Co-Issuers also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2014-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes Class A-1 (the Variable Funding Notes\u201d), which allows for drawings of up to $100 million of Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the Notes.\u201d The Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which substantially all of our domestic revenue-generating assets and our domestic intellectual property, are held by the Co-Issuers and certain other special-purpose, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company (the Guarantors\u201d) that act as guarantors of the Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure the Notes.\n (b) System-wide sales\u201d are retail sales at Applebee's restaurants operated by franchisees and IHOP restaurants operated by franchisees and area licensees, as reported to the Company, in addition to retail sales at company-operated restaurants. Sales at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the Company. An increase in franchisees' reported sales will result in a corresponding increase in our royalty revenue, while a decrease in franchisees' reported sales will result in a corresponding decrease in our royalty revenue. Unaudited reported sales for Applebee's domestic franchise restaurants, IHOP franchise restaurants and IHOP area license restaurants for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Company incurred costs of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to exit a facility in connection with the consolidation of the Applebee's Kansas City restaurant support center. Of that total, $2.5 million related to the termination of our involvement in a lease covering two floors of the facility and $0.4 million was accrued as the present value of future lease payments, net of assumed sublease rentals, of a portion of one floor of the facility.\nIn October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of the Company's common stock (the 2015 Repurchase Program\u201d) on an opportunistic basis from time to time in open market transactions and in privately negotiated transactions based on business, market, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. The 2015 Repurchase Program, as approved by the Board of Directors, does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares and can be terminated at any time. A summary of shares repurchased under the 2015 Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2017 and cumulatively, is as follows:\n(1) Favorable (unfavorable) variance in comparing 2016 and 2014 results with 2015 results that exclude the 53rd calendar week of 2015.\nWe make judgments as to whether uncertainty as to collectibility of the consideration that we are owed precludes recognition of the revenue on an accrual basis. These judgments are based on the facts specific to each circumstance. Primary factors considered include past payment history and our subjective assessment of the likelihood of receiving payment in the future.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate of 22.3% applied to pretax book loss was lower than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-deductibility of the impairment of Applebee's goodwill for federal income tax purposes, which partially offsets with the income tax benefit resulted from the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the federal tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 15 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory Federal tax rate.\n \u2022 We recognized a substantial benefit associated with the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, primarily due to a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. This revaluation reduced our net loss by $77.5 million, or $4.37 per share; \nThe DSCR ratio is Net Cash Flow for the four quarters preceding the calculation date divided by the total debt service payments of the preceding four quarters. The complete definitions of the DSCR and all calculation elements are contained in\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.20x - Manager Termination Event\nSee additional discussion of these impairments under the heading Financial Review - Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\u201d\nDomestic Same-Restaurant Sales Trends\n \u2022 Applebee's franchise expenses increased primarily because of a $2.5 million franchisor contribution to the Applebee's NAF and a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expense. \nOur 2017 total revenue declined $29.2 million compared to 2016. The significant components of the change are as follows:\nOur 2017 gross profit decreased $37.8 million compared to 2016. Primary components of the total change are as follows:\n\n \u2022 Applebee's franchise revenue decreased approximately $8 million due to a 5.0% decrease in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales. Lower franchise termination and transfer fees and an increase in the amount of royalties we did not recognize due to uncertainty as to collectibility also contributed to the decrease. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.9 million from a full year of royalty revenues in 2016 from 23 refranchised restaurants compared to six months of royalty revenue in 2015. \nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. This test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets. The preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws. When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our income tax expense will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\nIn determining the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit, we used the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Significant assumptions made by management in estimating fair value under the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales, operating expenses, overhead expenses, depreciation, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, along with an appropriate discount rate based on our estimated cost of equity capital and after-tax cost of debt. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the guideline public company method include the selection of guideline companies and the valuation multiples applied. In determining the fair value of the Applebee's tradename, we used the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales, a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\n(a) During the twelve months ending December 31, 2017, nine company-operated restaurants were refranchised and one was permanently closed.\nThe Variable Funding Notes were undrawn upon issuance on September 30, 2014 and we have not drawn on them since issuance. At December 31, 2017, approximately $3.1 million was pledged against the Variable Funding Notes for outstanding letters of credit, leaving $96.9 million of Variable Funding Notes available for borrowings. The letters of credit are used primarily to satisfy insurance-related collateral requirements.\nWhile the Notes are outstanding, payment of principal and interest is required to be made on the Class A-2 Notes on a quarterly basis. The quarterly principal payment of $3.25 million on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the leverage ratio for the Company and its subsidiaries is less than or equal to 5.25x. In general, the leverage ratio is our indebtedness divided by adjusted EBITDA for the four preceding quarterly periods. The complete definitions of all calculation elements of the leverage ratio are contained in the Base Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 3, 2014 ( Base Indenture\u201d). Exceeding the leverage ratio of 5.25x does not violate any covenant related to the Notes. As of December 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was 5.70x (See Exhibit 12.1). We made one principal payment of $3.25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and anticipate we will be required to make four quarterly principal payments during 2018.\n \u2022 Our gross profit decreased $37.8 million, primarily due to a decrease of $38.1 million in gross profit from Applebee's franchise operations. Nearly $29 million of the decline was due to Applebee's franchisee financial health issues, specifically, an $11.5 million increase in bad debt expense; an increase of $7.0 million in contributions we made to the \n \u2022 Applebee's franchise expenses increased primarily because of an $11.5 million increase in bad debt expense and an increase in franchisor marketing contributions. We contributed $9.5 million to the Applebee's NAF in 2017 to mitigate the decline in franchisee contributions that are based on a percentage of restaurant sales as compared to a $2.5 million contribution in 2016. \nIn evaluating the performance of Applebee's and IHOP, we consider the key performance indicators to be the percentage change in system-wide sales, the percentage change in domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales ( domestic same-restaurant sales\u201d) and net franchise restaurant development. Changes in both domestic same-restaurant sales and in the number of Applebee's and IHOP franchise restaurants directly impact the system-wide retail sales that drive our franchise royalty revenues. Restaurant development also impacts franchise revenue in the form of initial franchise fees and, in the case of IHOP restaurants, sales of proprietary pancake and waffle dry mix.\n\n\nManagement makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease, which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday and/or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.\n \u2022 Advertising expenses increased concurrently with the increase in advertising revenues.  Advertising contributions designated for IHOP's national advertising fund and local marketing and advertising cooperatives, as well as advertising contributions from international franchise restaurants of both brands, are recognized as revenue and expense of franchise operations. Because we have less contractual control over Applebee's domestic advertising expenditures, Applebee's domestic national advertising fund activity is not recognized as franchise revenue and expense. However, effective with the January 1, 2018, adoption of accounting guidance promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board with respect to revenue recognition, we will include contributions to and expenditures from the Applebee's NAF as revenue and expense of franchise operations, as is currently done with contributions to and expenditures from the IHOP NAF. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe performed an interim quantitative test for impairment of Applebee's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of performing the interim quantitative test, we recognized an impairment of Applebee's goodwill of $358.2 million and an impairment of Applebee's tradename of $173.4 million.\nDomestically, Applebee's and IHOP franchise restaurants are located in all 50 states and two IHOP franchise restaurants are located in the District of Columbia. Internationally, IHOP restaurants are located in three United States territories and 13 countries outside of the United States; Applebee's restaurants are located in two United States territories and 15 countries outside of the United States. With over 3,700 restaurants combined, we believe we are the largest full-service restaurant company in the world. The June 19, 2017 issue of Nation's Restaurant News reported that IHOP and Applebee's were the largest restaurant systems in the family dining and casual dining categories, respectively, in terms of United States system-wide sales during 2016. This marks the tenth consecutive year our two brands have achieved the number one ranking in Nation's Restaurant News.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $17.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Our net income plus the non-cash reconciling items shown in our statements of cash flows (primarily depreciation, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation) was essentially unchanged from 2015. However, net changes in working capital used cash of $12.4 million during 2016 as opposed to providing cash of $4.3 million during 2015. This unfavorable change of $16.8 million primarily resulted from two items unique to 2015 that did not recur in 2016: an increase in collections of gift card receivables due to the 53rd calendar week in fiscal 2015, partially offset by a $10.4 million reduction of interest payable because of payment of an additional two months of interest in 2015 due to our 2014 refinancing of debt.\n\n \u2022 IHOP franchise revenues improved primarily due to increases in effective franchise restaurants due to franchisee development and an increase in international sales. These favorable items were primarily offset by a $1.6 million decrease in sales of pancake and waffle dry mix and a 1.9% decrease in IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales. \nYou should read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report.\nInvesting Activities\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n \u2022 Rental and financing revenues decreased primarily due to the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \nLeases", "item_7_text": "The assumptions used in both the discounted cash flow method and the relief of royalty method are determined by the Company based on historical results, trends and anticipated growth resulting from specific development initiatives planned to be implemented over the time horizon covered by the Company's projections. The most impactful assumptions are the discount rate and the forecasted change in system-wide sales (due to a combination of changes in same-restaurant sales and in net restaurant development) that impact our royalty revenues.\nThe total number of Applebee's franchise restaurants open at December 31, 2017 declined 4% from the number open at December 31, 2016 as franchisees opened 19 new restaurants but closed 99 restaurants. Restaurant closures can occur for a variety of reasons that may differ for each restaurant and for each franchisee. Closures generally fall into one of two categories: restaurants in older locations whose retail, residential and traffic demographics have changed unfavorably over time, and restaurants with non-viable unit economics. The majority of Applebee's restaurant closures in 2017 were due to these factors. While 18 of the restaurants were closed by a single franchisee, no other franchisee had more than 10 restaurant closures.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. Our significant accounting policies are comprehensively described in Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe the accounting policies discussed below are particularly important to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require higher degree of judgment and/or complexity in the preparation of those consolidated financial statements. In exercising those judgments, we make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying values of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses in the reporting periods covered by the financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience, current conditions and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. We adjust such estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances dictate. Accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. Changes in estimates and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow in the future.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2017, we noted that the decline in the market price of our common stock since December 31, 2016, which we had believed to be temporary, persisted throughout the first eight months of 2017 and that the favorable trend in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales experienced in the second quarter of 2017 did not continue into the first two months of the third quarter of 2017. We also noted a continuing increase in Applebee's bad debt expense and in royalties not recognized in income due to uncertainty as to collectibility. Additionally, we also determined an increasing shortfall in franchisee contributions to the Applebee's national advertising fund could require a larger amount of future subsidization in the form of additional franchisor contributions to the fund than previously estimated. Based on these unfavorable developments, we determined that indicators of impairment existed and that an interim test of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment should be performed.\nIHOP franchisees and area licensees opened 77 restaurants in 2017 and closed 23 restaurants, resulting in net development of 54 restaurants, the highest net development since 2009. The opening of 77 restaurants was the highest annual total of franchise restaurant openings for IHOP since the Current Business Model was adopted in 2004. We believe the IHOP closures were primarily due to natural attrition as the total number of closures in 2017 was only slightly higher than the average annual closure rate of 21 restaurants per year over the three previous years.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States of America signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d). The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxes, including a permanent reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The reduction in the corporate rate requires a one-time revaluation of certain tax-related assets and liabilities. As a result of the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2017, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of approximately $77.5 million. The Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance that allows entities to record provisional amounts during a measurement period not to extend beyond one year of the enactment date of the Tax Act. Where we were able to make reasonable estimates of the effects of the Tax Act for which our analysis is not yet complete, we recorded provisional amounts in accordance with the guidance. Where we have not yet been able to make reasonable estimates of the impact of certain elements of the Tax Act, we have not recorded any amounts related to those elements and have continued accounting for them in accordance with the tax laws in effect immediately prior to the enactment of the Tax Act.\nRental revenue declined $1.6 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to a $1.4 million decrease in rental income based on a percentage of franchisees' retail sales and the expected progressive decline of $1.2 million in interest income as direct financing leases are repaid. These unfavorable items were partially offset by contractual increases in base sublease rentals revenue. Rental expenses decreased $0.9 million in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily because of a $1.3 million decline in interest expense as capital lease obligations are repaid and a decline in depreciation expense, partially offset by contractual increases in prime lease expenses.\nWe performed a quantitative test for impairment of Applebee's goodwill and tradename as of October 31, 2016, the annual testing date. We identified no impairments as a result of performing these quantitative assessments, however, we did note that the fair value of the Applebee's Franchise Reporting Unit exceeded the carrying value of the unit by 9% and therefore considered the unit to be at risk of impairment.\nThe decrease in interest expense in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to $1.2 million of additional expense because of the 53rd calendar week in 2015.\nOn February 14, 2018, our Board of Directors approved payment of a cash dividend of $0.63 per share of common stock, payable at the close of business on April 6, 2018 to the stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2018.\nOverview\nThe following table sets forth for each of the past three years the number of Effective Restaurants\u201d in the Applebee's and IHOP systems and information regarding the percentage change in sales at those restaurants compared to the same periods in the prior two years. Sales at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the Company and, as such, the percentage changes in sales presented below are based on non-GAAP sales data. However, we believe that presentation of this information is useful in analyzing our revenues because franchisees and area licensees pay us royalties and advertising fees that are generally based on a percentage of their sales, and, where applicable, rental payments under leases that partially may be based on a percentage of their sales. Management also uses this information to make decisions about future plans for the development of additional restaurants as well as evaluation of current operations.\nAn overview of our key performance indicators for the year ended December 31, 2017 is as follows:\n________________________________________________\nWe evaluate dividend payments on common stock and repurchases of common stock within the context of our overall capital allocation strategy with our Board of Directors on an ongoing basis, giving consideration to our current and forecast earnings, financial condition, cash requirements and other factors. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay such dividends or the amount of such dividends.\nFinancing operations relate primarily to IHOP franchise restaurants that were developed under the Previous IHOP Business Model described under Item 1. - Business. Financing operations revenue primarily consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases. We also sell equipment associated with IHOP franchise restaurants we have reacquired when those restaurants are subsequently refranchised to a new franchisee. Financing expenses are primarily the cost of the restaurant equipment sold.\nClosure Charges\nThe Notes were issued under a Base Indenture, dated September 30, 2014 (the Base Indenture\u201d) and the related Series 2014-1 Supplement to the Base Indenture, dated September 30, 2014 (the Series 2014-1 Supplement\u201d), among the Co-Issuers and Citibank, N.A., as the trustee (in such capacity, the Trustee\u201d) and securities intermediary. The Base Indenture and the Series 2014-1 Supplement (collectively, the Indenture\u201d) will allow the Co-Issuers to issue additional series of notes in the future subject to certain conditions set forth therein.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n(1) Includes interest calculated on balances as of December 31, 2017 using interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2017.\nthe Base Indenture. Failure to maintain a prescribed DSCR ratio can trigger a Cash Trapping Event, A Rapid Amortization Event, a Manager Termination Event or a Default Event as described below. In a Cash Trapping Event, the Trustee is required to retain a certain percentage of cash flow in a restricted account. In a Rapid Amortization Event, all excess Cash Flow is retained and used to retire principal amounts of debt. Key DSCR ratios are as follows:\n\n(3) This amount represents the maximum potential liability for future payment guarantees under leases that have been assigned to third-party buyers of Applebee's company-operated restaurants and expire at the end of the respective lease terms, which range from 2018 through 2048. See Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nRental revenue declined $4.7 million in 2016 compared to 2015, of which $2.5 million was due to a 53rd calendar week in 2015 and $1.3 million was due to the expected progressive decline as direct financing leases are repaid. There was also a decrease in rental income based on a percentage of franchisees' retail sales. Rental expenses decreased $3.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to a $1.7 million decline in interest expense as capital lease obligations are repaid and additional expenses of $1.2 million due to the 53rd week of 2015.\nLong-lived Tangible Asset Impairments\nExecutive Summary of 2017 Results\n\nBased on our current level of operations, we believe that our cash flow from operations, available cash and available borrowings under our Variable Funding Notes will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during 2018.\n(4) Primarily used to satisfy insurance-related collateral requirements. These letters of credit expire annually, but are typically renewed in the same amount each year unless collateral requirements change.\nAs discussed above under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information,\u201d over the past two years we have refranchised the last company-operated restaurants of both brands. As of December 31, 2017, we do not operate any restaurants. From time to time, we have operated IHOP restaurants reacquired from franchisees on a temporary basis until those restaurants are refranchised and we may reacquire both IHOP and Applebee's restaurants on a temporary basis in the future. There were no restaurants under temporary operation at December 31, 2017. The 53rd calendar week in 2015 did not have a significant impact on the comparisons of restaurant sales, expenses and gross profit between 2016 and 2015.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn determining the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit, we used the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Significant assumptions made by management in estimating fair value under the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales, operating expenses, overhead expenses, depreciation, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, along with an appropriate discount rate based on our estimated cost of equity capital and after-tax cost of debt. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the guideline public company method include the selection of guideline companies and the valuation multiples applied.\n\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.75x but equal to or greater than 1.50x - Cash Trapping Event, 50% of Net Cash Flow\nAccounting Standards Adopted in the Current Fiscal Year\nCovenants and Restrictions\n\nWhile we are encouraged by the improvement in Applebee's same-restaurant sales and customer traffic during the fourth quarter of 2017, there can be no assurance that this favorable trend will continue or to what extent any improvement in same-restaurant sales and customer traffic might mitigate the franchisee health issues discussed above. Until such mitigation occurs, we may, in the future, continue to experience relatively high charges for bad debt as a percentage of revenue or be unable to recognize all of the royalty revenue to which we are entitled.\nWe have obligations for guarantees on certain franchisee lease agreements, as disclosed below in Contractual Obligations and Commitments\u201d and Note 10 - Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Other than such guarantees, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4) of SEC Regulation S-K as of December 31, 2017.\n\nOur 2016 total franchise revenue declined $10.3 million compared to 2015, most of which was due to a 53rd calendar week in 2015 as discussed above under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information.\u201d Other components of the total change are as follows:\nIf no indicators of impairment have been noted during these preliminary assessments, we perform an assessment of goodwill and intangible assets annually in the fourth fiscal quarter. We first assess qualitatively whether it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment does not exist. Significant factors considered in this assessment include, but are not limited to, macro-economic conditions, market and industry conditions, cost considerations, the competitive environment, share price fluctuations, overall financial performance and results of past impairment tests. If we do not qualitatively determine that it is more-likely-than-not that an impairment does not exist, we perform a quantitative impairment test.\n (1) Equipment lease receivables extend through the year 2029. \nIncome before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $578.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary reasons for the decline are summarized as follows:\n \u2022 Advertising expenses increased concurrently with the increase in advertising revenues. \nCash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by revenues earned and collected from our franchisees, and profit from our rental operations and financing operations. Franchise revenues primarily consist of royalties and franchise fees from Applebee's and IHOP franchised restaurants, IHOP advertising fees and sales of proprietary products by IHOP, each of which fluctuates with increases or decreases in franchise retail sales. Franchise retail sales are impacted by the development of IHOP and Applebee's restaurants by our franchisees and by fluctuations in same-restaurant sales. Rental operations profit is rental income less rental expenses. Rental income includes revenues from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases. Rental income is impacted by fluctuations in same-restaurant sales as some operating leases include a provision for contingent rent based on retail sales and by a progressive decline in rental income as leases expire. Rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on franchisee-operated restaurants. Interest expense on prime capital leases also declines progressively as lease obligations are repaid. Financing operations revenue consists of interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as well as periodic sales of restaurant equipment. Financing income is impacted by a progressive decline in interest revenue as the obligations financed are repaid. Financing expenses are primarily the cost of restaurant equipment.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year. Every five or six years, our fiscal year contains 53 calendar weeks. Our 2015 fiscal year contained 53 calendar weeks, whereas fiscal 2017 and 2016 each contained 52 calendar weeks. The estimated impact of the 53rd week on fiscal 2015 results of operations was an increase in revenue of $13.8 million, an increase in gross profit of $9.4 million, an increase in income before income taxes of $6.8 million and an increase in cash from operating activities of approximately $6 million. These amounts represent unfavorable variances in the respective line items in comparing 2016 results with 2015 results.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nIncome Taxes\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow\n_________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn connection with the issuance of the Class A-2 Notes, the Co-Issuers also entered into a revolving financing facility that allows for the drawings of up to $100 million of Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Variable Funding Notes were issued under the Indenture and allow for drawings on a revolving basis. Drawings and certain additional terms related to the Variable Funding Notes are governed by the Class A-1 Note Purchase Agreement dated as of September 30,\nOur 2016 total revenue declined $47.1 million compared to 2015, of which $13.8 million was due to a 53rd calendar week in 2015. Other components of the total change are as follows:\nSystem-wide Sales and Domestic Same-Restaurant Sales\nIn the short term, a decline in customer traffic at either brand may be offset by an increase in average customer check resulting from an increase in menu prices, a favorable change in product sales mix, or a combination thereof. A sustained decline in same-restaurant customer traffic that cannot be offset by an increase in average customer check could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, due to, among other things, reduced royalty revenues, higher bad debt expense resulting from the failure or inability of franchisees to pay amounts owed to us when due, and a possible decline in the number of franchise restaurants because of reduced restaurant development or restaurant closures.\n (c) Sales percentage change\u201d reflects, for each category of restaurants, the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year for all restaurants in that category. The sales percentage change for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was impacted by a 53rd calendar week in fiscal year 2015. \nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2017 was primarily attributable to $20.5 million of principal receipts from notes, equipment contracts and other long-term receivables partially offset by $13.3 million of capital expenditures. The increase in capital expenditures compared to 2016 was primarily due to spending in information technology infrastructure projects. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $16 million in fiscal 2018.\n \u2022 IHOP franchise revenues improved due to increases in effective franchise restaurants due to franchisee development and an increase in sales of pancake and waffle dry mix. These favorable items were primarily offset by a $1.4 million decrease in franchise termination, transfer and extension fees. The 0.1% decrease in IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales did not have a significant impact on the change in 2016 IHOP franchise revenues compared to 2015. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n(1) Global Effective Franchise Restaurants are the weighted average number of franchise restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for franchise restaurants open for only a portion of the period.\n (2) Direct financing lease receivables extend through the year 2036. \nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nLegal Contingencies\nOur 2016 total franchise expenses increased $5.7 million compared to 2015, which included $2.9 million of favorability because of a 53rd calendar week in 2015. Other components of the total change are as follows:\n(1) Effective Company Restaurants are the weighted average number of company-operated restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for company-operated restaurants open for only a portion of the period.\n \u2022 Rental and financing revenues decreased primarily due to the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \nThere is a progressive decline in interest income from the financing of franchise fees and equipment leases as note balances are repaid. As a result of this decline, interest income decreased by $1.2 million between 2017 and 2016 and by $1.1 million between 2016 and 2015. The remaining minor variances in financing revenues and expenses are due to changes in sales and cost of sales of equipment associated with reacquired IHOP franchise restaurants subsequently refranchised to new franchisees. Sales of equipment associated with reacquired IHOP restaurants are, by nature, unpredictable and variable in any given year. The 53rd calendar week in 2015 did not have a significant impact on the comparisons of financing revenues, expenses and gross profit between 2016 and 2015.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nExecutive Separation Costs\nKansas City Lease Exit Costs\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nSignificant Known Events, Trends or Uncertainties Impacting or Expected to Impact Comparisons of Reported or Future Results\nIHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 0.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. The decline in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to a decrease in customer traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average customer check. IHOP customer traffic has declined for nine consecutive quarters, however, the percentage decrease in the fourth quarter of 2017 was the smallest since the first quarter of 2016. We believe the improvement in IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017 was due to successful limited-time promotions along with the roll-out of our new IHOP 'N Go\u201d mobile ordering technology. For the full year ended December 31, 2017, IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 1.9%. The decrease for the full year 2017 also was due to a decrease in customer traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average customer check.\nLong-Lived Assets\n \u2022 Company restaurant revenue declined primarily due to the refranchising of nine IHOP company-operated restaurants as noted above under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information.\u201d \nCash provided by operating activities decreased $52.4 million in 2017 compared to 2016. Our net income plus the non-cash reconciling items shown in our statements of cash flows (primarily impairment charges, depreciation, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation) decreased $37.3 million from 2016. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in gross profit from Applebee's franchise operations and the increase in G&A expenses discussed in preceding sections of the MD&A. Additionally, net changes in working capital used cash of $27.5 million during 2017 compared to using cash of $12.4 million during 2016. This unfavorable change of $15.1 million primarily resulted from an increase in accounts receivable of $12 million, an increase in current tax assets and liabilities of $8 million and the prepayment of approximately $8 million in rent, partially offset by a decrease in payments of incentive compensation (smaller payments in the first quarter of 2017 of 2016 bonuses compared to first quarter 2016 payments of 2015 bonuses). The increase in accounts receivable was due in part slow payment of receivables by certain Applebee's franchisees.\n \u2022 Franchise gross profit declined primarily due to the decrease in revenue described above, an increase in Applebee's bad debt expense and an increase in franchisor contributions to the Applebee's NAF. \nGross profit as a percentage of revenue declined in 2017 compared to 2016 primarily because of the increase in Applebee's bad debt and franchisor contributions to the Applebee's NAF. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue declined in 2016 compared to 2015 primarily because of the increase in Applebee's franchise expenses as well as the increases in advertising revenue which generated no incremental gross profit, partially offset by favorability in pancake and waffle dry mix.\nLong-Term Debt\nThere is an inherent degree of uncertainty in preparing any forecast of future results. The projections used in performing the impairment tests reflected an increase in system-wide sales from estimated full-year 2017 amounts, in progressively larger increments, over the time period covered by the projections. System-wide sales are dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's restaurants. Accordingly, there are a number of potential events that could reasonably be expected to negatively affect the forecast of system-wide sales, including a decrease in customers' disposable income available for discretionary spending (because of circumstances such as job losses, credit constraints, higher housing costs, changes to tax regulations, energy costs, interest rates or other costs) or a decrease in the perceived wealth of customers (because of circumstances such as lower residential real estate values, increased foreclosure rates, increased tax rates or other economic disruptions). As a result, our business could experience a decline in sales and/or customer traffic as potential customers choose lower-cost alternatives (such as quick-service restaurants) or other alternatives to dining out. Additionally, negative trends in the availability of credit and in expenses such as interest rates and the cost of construction materials could affect our franchisees' ability to maintain and remodel existing restaurants. Any decreases in customer traffic or average customer check due to these or other reasons could reduce gross sales at franchise restaurants, resulting in lower royalty and other payments from franchisees. This could reduce the profitability of franchise restaurants, potentially impacting the ability of franchisees to make royalty payments owed to us when due (which could adversely impact our current cash flow from franchise operations) and negatively impacting franchisees' ability to develop new restaurants (which could adversely impact our future cash flows from franchise operations).\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.30x - Rapid Amortization Event\n (a) Global Effective Restaurants\u201d are the weighted average number of restaurants open in a given fiscal period, adjusted to account for restaurants open for only a portion of the period. Information is presented for all Effective Restaurants in the Applebee's and IHOP systems, domestic and international, which includes restaurants owned by franchisees and area licensees as well as those owned by the Company. \n_________________________________\nShare Repurchases\nApproximately $2.2 million of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to one IHOP company-operated restaurant closed during 2017, with the remainder primarily related to adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2017. Approximately $0.7 million of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 related to one IHOP franchise restaurant and one Applebee's restaurant closed during 2016, with the remainder related to adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2016. The substantial majority of closure charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to two IHOP franchise restaurants closed during 2015, partially offset by minor adjustments to the estimated reserve for IHOP and Applebee's restaurants closed prior to 2015.\nIn June 2017, we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of nine company-operated IHOP restaurants in the Cincinnati, Ohio market area. As part of the transaction, we entered into an asset purchase agreement, nine franchise agreements and nine sublease agreements for land and buildings. The Company compared the stated rent under the sublease agreements with comparable market rents and recorded net favorable lease assets of $2.3 million in related to the transaction. The Company also received cash of $1.1 million and a note receivable for $4.8 million. After allocating a portion of the consideration to franchise fees and derecognition of the assets sold, we recognized a gain of $6.2 million on the refranchising and sale of the nine restaurants.\nThroughout 2017 we addressed franchisee financial health through a collaborative effort between ourselves, a third-party advisor and franchisee representatives. We have considered various forms of assistance to franchisees, such as restaurant closures, assessing franchisee debt arrangements, temporary forbearance on payment obligations, extensions of credit and other support programs. To date, the assistance provided primarily has been the approved closures of non-viable restaurants and waiver of related termination fees, as well as loans to certain franchisees. Applebee's restaurant closures during 2017 reduced our royalty revenue by approximately $4.1 million. Any additional assistance to franchisees may entail incremental costs.\n \u2022 We incurred a net loss of $330.5 million, due in large part to impairment charges taken in the third quarter of 2017 of $358.2 million for Applebee's goodwill and $173.4 million for Applebee's tradename. The goodwill impairment was not deductible for federal income tax purposes and therefore we received no tax benefit related to the goodwill impairment. We did recognize a deferred tax benefit of $65.1 million related to the impairment charge for Applebee's tradename; \nIHOP's performance for both the fourth quarter and full year of 2017 lagged that of the family dining segment of the restaurant industry. Based on data from Black Box, during the fourth quarter of 2017, the family dining segment had an increase in same-restaurant sales due primarily to an increase in average check that was larger than IHOP's, offset by a decrease in traffic that was also larger than IHOP's. For the full-year 2017, the family dining segment experienced a smaller decrease in same-restaurant sales than IHOP, due primarily to a smaller decrease in traffic than IHOP experienced.\nThere is an inherent degree of uncertainty in preparing any forecast of future results. The projections used in performing the impairment tests reflected an increase in system-wide sales from estimated full-year 2017 amounts, in progressively larger increments, over the time period covered by the projections. System-wide sales are dependent to a significant extent on national, regional and local economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, on global economic conditions, particularly those conditions affecting the demographics of the guests that frequently patronize Applebee's restaurants.

As a result, we no longer operate any IHOP restaurants on a permanent basis. In July 2015, we refranchised 23 Applebee's company-operated restaurants in the Kansas City, Missouri market area. As of that date, we no longer operated any Applebee's restaurants on a permanent basis.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow is considered to be a non-U.S. GAAP measure. Reconciliation of the cash provided by operating activities to adjusted free cash flow is as follows:\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing receivables; however, changes in circumstances relating to receivables may result in additional allowances in the future. We determine the allowance based on historical experience, current payment patterns, future obligations and our assessment of the ability to pay outstanding balances. The primary indicator of credit quality is delinquency, which is considered to be a receivable balance greater than 90 days past due. We continually review our allowance for doubtful accounts. Past due balances and future obligations are reviewed individually for collectability. Account balances are charged against the allowance after all collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote.\nKey Performance Indicators\n\n \u2022 Company-operated restaurant gross profit improved slightly due to the refranchising of nine IHOP company-operated restaurants noted above. \nDividends\nInternationally, franchisees of both brands opened 37 restaurants and closed 22, for net development of 15 restaurants. This international activity is included in the total activity for each brand cited above.\nTax Cuts and Jobs Act\nAs a result of performing the interim quantitative test, we recognized an impairment of Applebee's goodwill of $358.2 million and an impairment of Applebee's tradename of $173.4 million. After the impairments, the balances of goodwill and the tradename intangible asset allocated to the Applebee's franchise unit as of September 30, 2017 were $328.5 million and $479.0 million, respectively. We adopted the guidance in FASB Accounting Standards Update 2017-04 on January 1, 2017; accordingly, the amount of the goodwill impairment was determined as the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeded the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit that was estimated in the quantitative test. These assets are at risk of additional impairment in the future in the event of sustained downward movement in the Company's stock price, downward revisions of long-term performance assumptions or increases in the assumed long-term discount rate.\n________________________________________\nOperating Activities\n (d) Domestic same-restaurant sales change\u201d reflects the percentage change in sales in any given fiscal year, compared to the same weeks in the prior year, for domestic restaurants that have been operated throughout both fiscal years that are being compared and have been open for at least 18 months. Because of new unit openings and restaurant closures, the domestic restaurants open throughout the fiscal years being compared may be different from year to year. Domestic same-restaurant sales percentage change does not include data on IHOP area license restaurants. \nThe Notes are secured by a security interest in substantially all of the assets of the Co-Issuers and the Guarantors (collectively, the Securitization Entities\u201d). As of September 30, 2014, these assets (the Securitized Assets\u201d) generally included substantially all of the domestic revenue-generating assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, which principally consist of franchise agreements, area license agreements, development agreements, franchisee fee notes, equipment leases, agreements related to the production and sale of pancake and waffle dry-mixes, owned and leased real property and intellectual property.\n\nClass A-2 Notes\nWe define adjusted free cash flow\u201d for a given period as cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contract receivables, less additions to property and equipment. Management uses this liquidity measure in its periodic assessments of, among other things, the amount of cash dividends per share of common stock and repurchases of common stock and we believe it is important for investors to have the same measure used by management for that purpose. Adjusted free cash flow does not represent residual cash flow available for discretionary purposes.\nApplebee's National Advertising Fund (the Applebee's NAF\u201d) to mitigate the decline in franchisee contributions that are based on a percentage of restaurant sales; a $6.2 million decrease in royalty revenue because of uncertainty as to collectibility; and a $4.1 million decrease in royalty revenue due to restaurant closures. An additional $8.3 million of the total decline was due to a 5.3% decrease in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales;\n\nOur 2017 total franchise expenses increased $19.5 million compared to 2016. The significant components of the total change are as follows:\nLong-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2017 were insignificant. Long-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2016 comprised a charge of $0.6 million for one IHOP company-operated restaurant and charges totaling $0.4 million of individually insignificant charges at eight IHOP company-operated restaurants. Long-lived tangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily related to $1.1 million of individually insignificant charges at eight IHOP company-operated restaurants and four Applebee's company-operated restaurants. The Company evaluated the causal factors of all impairments of long-lived assets as they were recorded in each year and concluded they were based on factors specific to each asset and not potential indicators of an impairment of other long-lived assets.\n\nRental operations relate primarily to IHOP franchise restaurants that were developed under the Previous IHOP Business Model described under Item 1. - Business. Rental income includes revenue from operating leases and interest income from direct financing leases. Rental expenses are costs of prime operating leases and interest expense on prime capital leases on certain franchise restaurants.\n \u2022 Franchise revenues decreased due to a 5.3% decline in Applebee's same-restaurant sales, an increase in Applebee's revenue we did not recognize due to uncertainty as to collectibility, an increase in closures of Applebee's restaurants, and a decrease in sales of IHOP pancake and waffle dry mix. These unfavorable items were partially offset by new restaurant development by IHOP franchisees. \nVirtually all domestic Applebee's franchisees have entered into an amendment to their franchise agreements that will increase their contribution to the Applebee's NAF by 0.25% to 3.50% of their gross sales and decrease their minimum local promotional expenditures to 0.25% of their gross sales for the period from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019. Such franchisees have also agreed to an incremental temporary increase in the advertising contribution rate, subject to certain contingencies. We will contribute an additional $30 million to the Applebee's NAF during the first six months of 2018.\n(1) Franchise and area license restaurant openings, net of closings\n (3) Franchise note receivables extend through the year 2024.  Financing Activities\nOn a regular basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of long-lived assets (primarily assets related to properties and equipment leased or subleased to franchisees) may not be recoverable. We test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows. Significant factors considered include, but are not limited to, current and forecast sales, current and forecast cash flows, the number of years the franchisee's restaurant has been in operation, its remaining lease life, and other factors which apply on a case-by-case basis. The analysis is performed at the individual restaurant level for indicators of permanent impairment. Recoverability of the Company's assets is measured by comparing the assets' carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated over the assets' remaining useful life or remaining lease term, whichever is less. This process requires the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to a high degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.\nFrom time to time, we also repurchase shares owned and tendered by employees to satisfy tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted stock awards. Shares are deemed purchased at the closing price of our common stock on the vesting date. See Part II, Item 5 for detail on all share repurchase activity during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nAt December 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents totaled $117.0 million, including $57.1 million of cash held for gift card programs and IHOP advertising funds.\nThis non-U.S. GAAP measure is not defined in the same manner by all companies and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Non-U.S. GAAP measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, the U.S. GAAP information contained within our financial statements.\nOur restaurants are located on (i) sites owned by us, (ii) sites leased by us from third parties and (iii) sites owned or leased by franchisees. For sites owned by or leased by us from third parties, we, in turn, sublease to our franchisees. At the inception of the lease, each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease in accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP governing the accounting for leases.\n\n \u2022 IHOP franchise expenses improved due to favorability in pancake and dry mix purchases. \nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, for a description of newly issued accounting standards that may impact us in the future.\n \u2022 IHOP franchisees opened 77 new restaurants worldwide, with net development of 54 restaurants. The opening of 77 restaurants was the highest annual total of franchise restaurant openings for IHOP since the Current Business Model was adopted in 2004. Applebee's franchisees closed 99 restaurants worldwide, with a net reduction of 80 restaurants. Taken together, the total number of our restaurants declined by less than 1% from last year's total; and \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Notes are obligations only of the Co-Issuers pursuant to the Indenture and are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement. Except as described below, neither we nor any of our subsidiaries, other than the Securitization Entities, guarantee or in any way are liable for the obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Indenture or the Notes.\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.50x - Cash Trapping Event, 100% of Net Cash Flow\nDuring 2018, we expect Applebee's franchisees to develop between 10 and 15 new restaurants globally, the majority of which are expected to be international openings. IHOP franchisees are projected to develop between 85 and 100 new IHOP restaurants globally, the majority of which are expected to be domestic openings. We anticipate the closing of between 60 and 80 Applebee's restaurants in 2018 as part of the continuation of a system-wide analysis to optimize the health of the franchisee system. We expect to close between 30 and 40 IHOP restaurants in 2018.\nOur effective tax rate ( ETR\u201d) of 22% for the year ended December 31, 2017 was significantly different than both the federal statutory rate of 35% and the ETR of 36% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 effective tax rate of 22.3% applied to pretax book loss was lower than the statutory federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-deductibility of the impairment of Applebee's goodwill for federal income tax purposes, which was partially offset by the income tax benefit resulted from the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the federal tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 15 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nSee Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report for a description of accounting standards we adopted in fiscal 2017.\nNet Franchise Restaurant Development\nAs of each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could impact our view with regards to future realization of deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we determined that, based on available evidence, the $1.1 million valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets was warranted due to Massachusetts enacted legislation requiring unitary businesses to file combined reports. As of December 31, 2017, management determined that sufficient positive evidence exists as of the reporting date to conclude that it is more likely than not the deferred taxes of $1.1 million are realizable, and therefore, reduced the valuation allowance accordingly.\nThe Variable Funding Notes will be governed, in part, by the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement and by certain generally applicable terms contained in the Indenture. Depending on the type of borrowing by the Co-Issuers, the applicable interest rate under the Variable Funding Notes is calculated at a per annum rate equal to (a) LIBOR plus 2.50%, (b) (i) the greatest of (x) the prime rate, (y) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% or (z) a daily rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 0.5% plus (ii) 2.00% or (c) the lenders' commercial paper funding rate plus 2.50%. There is a scaled commitment fee based on the unused portion of the Variable Funding Notes facility of between 50 to 100 basis points. It is anticipated that the principal and interest on the Variable Funding Notes will be repaid in full on or prior to September 2019 (the VFN Anticipated Repayment Date\u201d), subject to two additional one-year extensions at the option of the Company, which acts as the manager (as described below), upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. Following the VFN Anticipated Repayment Date (and any extensions thereof), additional interest will accrue on the Variable Funding Notes equal to 5.00% per annum. The Variable Funding Notes and other credit instruments issued under the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement are secured by the collateral described below under Guarantees and Collateral.\u201d\nFor the full year ended December 31, 2017, Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales decreased 5.3%, which was a 200 basis-point improvement over the decrease of 7.3% realized through the first nine months of 2017. The decrease in domestic same-restaurant sales for the full year 2017 was primarily due to a decline in customer traffic, along with a smaller decrease in average customer check. For the full year 2017, Applebee's performance trailed that of the casual dining segment. The casual dining segment's decrease in same-restaurant sales was smaller than Applebee's and was due to a decline in traffic that was partially offset by an increase in average check. As reported by Black Box, the decrease in customer traffic the casual dining segment experienced for the full year 2017 was smaller than the Applebee's decrease in customer traffic, and the casual dining segment experienced an increase in average customer check for the full year 2017 compared to Applebee's decrease in average customer check.\nUnder the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement dated September 30, 2014 (the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement\u201d), among the Guarantors in favor of the Trustee, the Guarantors guarantee the obligations of the Co-Issuers under the Indenture and related documents and secure the guarantee by granting a security interest in substantially all of their assets.\n\nPlease refer to Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of shares repurchased during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nGuarantees and Collateral\n \u2022 We returned nearly $80 million to our stockholders, comprised of $69.8 million in cash dividends and $10.0 million in the form of stock repurchases; \nVariable Funding Notes\nWe believe the differential between Applebee's performance for the full year 2017 and that of the casual dining segment is due in large part to unsuccessful tactical initiatives previously implemented by Applebee's that have since been addressed and to the inconsistent quality of operations across the Applebee's system. We engaged third-party consultants during the first half of 2017 to assess the continued decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales and to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove the positive sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred approximately $8.6 million of costs related to these stabilization initiatives in 2017.\nGeneral\nThe following table represents the timing of principal receipts on various long-term receivables due from our franchisees as of December 31, 2017:\nloss of key personnel, adverse legal or regulatory developments or a significant decline in the market price of our common stock.\n \u2022 Rental and financing gross profit was adversely impacted by the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \nApplebee's domestic same-restaurant sales increased 1.3% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from the same period in 2016, the first quarterly increase in two and one-half years. The increase in the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily due to an increase in customer traffic that was partially offset by a decrease in average customer check. We believe the increases in traffic and same-restaurant sales were due, in part, to favorable customer response to marketing initiatives implemented during the quarter, to our revitalized menu offerings and to operational improvements in the quality of the customer experience. Applebee's performance for the fourth quarter of 2017 exceeded that of the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry. Based on data from Black Box, the casual dining segment of the restaurant industry experienced a slight increase in same-restaurant sales during the fourth quarter of 2017 resulting from an increase in average customer check that was mostly offset by a decline in customer traffic. Applebee's outperformance during the fourth quarter was due primarily to its differential improvement in traffic.\n \u2022 We generated cash provided by operating activities of approximately $66 million and adjusted free cash flow (cash provided by operating activities, plus receipts from notes and equipment contract receivables, less additions to property and equipment) of approximately $63 million in 2017; \nConsolidated Results of Operations - Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015\n\nThe 2016 effective tax rate of 36.0% applied to pretax book income was higher than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to state and local income taxes, offset by applying a lower state tax rate to the deferred tax balances. The 2015 effective tax rate of 37.8% applied to pretax book income was higher than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to state and local income taxes.\nRefranchising of Company-operated Restaurants\nCapital Allocation\nFinancial Review\nThe actual number of openings may differ from both our expectations and development commitments. Historically, the actual number of restaurants developed in a particular year has been less than the total number committed to be developed due to various factors, including economic conditions and franchisee noncompliance with development agreements. The timing of new restaurant openings also may be affected by various factors including weather-related and other construction delays, difficulties in obtaining timely regulatory approvals and the impact of currency fluctuations on our international franchisees. The actual number of closures also may differ from our expectations. Our franchisees are independent businesses and decisions to close restaurants can be impacted by numerous factors in addition to changes in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales that are outside of our control, including but not limited to, franchisees' agreements with landlords and lenders.\nWe are subject to various lawsuits, administrative proceedings, audits, and claims arising in the ordinary course of business. Some of these lawsuits purport to be class actions and/or seek substantial damages. The outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty. An estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate, among other factors, the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. Changes in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe decrease in adjusted free cash flow in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above and an increase in capital expenditures. The decrease in adjusted free cash flow in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities discussed above as well as a decrease in net receipts from notes and equipment receivables as the early payoff of several equipment notes in 2015 did not recur in 2016.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources of the Company\n \u2022 Advertising revenues increased due to the IHOP restaurant development noted above. \nOn February 17, 2017, we announced the resignation of our former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (the former CEO\u201d), effective March 1, 2017. In accordance with the terms of the Separation Agreement and General Release filed as Exhibit 10.1 to Form 8-K filed on February 17, 2017, we recorded approximately $5.9 million for severance, separation pay and ancillary costs in the first quarter of 2017. All stock options and restricted stock awards held by the former CEO that were unvested at the time of the announcement became vested in connection with the separation. We recorded a charge of approximately $2.9 million related to the accelerated vesting of the equity awards in the first quarter of 2017. Total costs of $8.8 million related to the separation were included in G&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Company restaurant revenue declined primarily due to the refranchising of 23 Applebee's restaurants as noted under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information.\u201d \nWe have a 52/53 week fiscal year ending on the Sunday nearest to December 31 of each year. For convenience, in this annual report on Form 10-K, we refer to all fiscal years as ending on December 31 and all interim fiscal quarters as ending on March 31, June 30 and September 30 of the respective fiscal year. There were 52 calendar weeks in our 2017 and 2016 fiscal years that ended on December 31, 2017 and January 1, 2017, respectively, and 53 calendar weeks in our 2015 fiscal year that ended January 3, 2016.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $137.2 million during 2016. The primary uses of cash in financing activities consisted of cash dividends paid to stockholders totaling $67.4 million, repurchases of our common stock totaling $55.3 million, repayments of capital lease and financing obligations of $14.0 million and a net cash outflow of $0.4 million related to equity awards.\nThe legal final maturity of the Class A-2 Notes is in September 2044, but it is anticipated that, unless earlier prepaid to the extent permitted under the Indenture, the Class A-2 Notes will be repaid in September 2021 (the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date\u201d). If the Co-Issuers have not repaid or refinanced the Class A-2 Notes prior to the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date, the interest rate on the Class A-2 Notes will increase significantly. Specifically, additional interest will accrue on the Class A-2 Notes equal to the greater of (i) 5.00% per annum and (ii) a per annum interest rate equal to the amount, if any, by which the sum of the following exceeds the Class A-2 Note interest rate: (A) the yield to maturity (adjusted to a quarterly bond-equivalent basis) on the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date of the United States Treasury Security having a term closest to 10 years plus (B) 5.00% plus (C) 2.150%. Additionally, the Company's cash flow would become subject to a rapid amortization event as described below under Covenants and Restrictions.\u201d\nThe Notes are subject to a series of covenants and restrictions customary for transactions of this type, including (i) that the Co-Issuers maintain specified reserve accounts to be used to make required payments in respect of the Notes, (ii) provisions relating to optional and mandatory prepayments, and the related payment of specified amounts, including specified make-whole payments in the case of the Class A-2 Notes under certain circumstances, (iii) certain indemnification payments in the event, among other things, the transfers of the assets pledged as collateral for the Notes are in stated ways defective or ineffective and (iv) covenants relating to recordkeeping, access to information and similar matters. The Notes are also subject to customary rapid amortization events provided for in the Indenture, including events tied to failure of the Securitization Entities to maintain the stated debt service coverage ( DSCR\u201d) ratio, the trailing-twelve-month sum of domestic retail sales for all restaurants being below $3.5 billion on quarterly measurement dates, certain manager termination events, certain events of default and the failure to repay or refinance the Notes on the Class A-2 Anticipated Repayment Date. The Notes are also subject to certain customary events of default, including events relating to non-payment of required interest, principal or other amounts due on or with respect to the Notes, failure of the Securitization Entities to maintain the stated debt service coverage ratio, failure to comply with covenants within certain time frames, certain bankruptcy events, breaches of specified representations and warranties and certain judgments.\nStatements contained in this report may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Shortly thereafter, the Company's predecessor began developing and franchising additional restaurants. The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1976 with the name IHOP Corp. In November 2007, the Company completed the acquisition of Applebee's International, Inc., which became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. Effective June 2, 2008, the name of the Company was changed to DineEquity, Inc. and on February 20, 2018, the name of the Company was changed to Dine Brands Global, Inc.SM ( Dine Brands Global,\u201d we\u201d or our\u201d). Through various subsidiaries (see Exhibit 21, Subsidiaries of Dine Brands Global, Inc.), we own and franchise the Applebee's Neighborhood Grill & Bar\u00ae ( Applebee's\u201d) concept in the bar and grill segment within the casual dining category of the restaurant industry, and own, franchise and operate the International House of Pancakes\u00ae ( IHOP\u201d) concept in the family dining category of the restaurant industry. References herein to Applebee's\u00ae and IHOP\u00ae restaurants are to these two concepts, whether operated by franchisees, area licensees or us.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets primarily relates to franchising rights arising from the November 2007 acquisition of Applebee's. See Note 6 - Other Intangible Assets, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe income tax provision will vary from period to period for two primary reasons: a change in pretax book income and a change in the effective tax rate. Changes in our pretax book income between 2017 and 2016 and between 2016 and 2015 are addressed in the preceding sections of Results of Operations - Fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.\u201d\n53rd week in Fiscal 2015\n \u2022 IHOP franchisees remodeled 320 domestic restaurants in 2017 under our new Rise N' Shine design. A total of 620 restaurants have been remodeled since the Rise N' Shine design was announced in late 2015.  Key Performance Indicators\nThe following tables summarize Applebee's and IHOP restaurant development and franchising activity over the past three years: \nStock-Based Compensation\n\nIn July 2015, we completed the refranchising and sale of related restaurant assets of 23 company-operated Applebee's restaurants in the Kansas City, Missouri market area and we recognized a gain of $2 million on the transaction. There were no other individually significant gains or losses on dispositions of assets during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nNet cash provided by investing activities in 2016 was primarily attributable to $18.7 million of principal receipts from notes, equipment contracts and other long-term receivables partially offset by $5.6 million of capital expenditures.\nThe Notes are secured by the collateral described below under Guarantees and Collateral.\u201d\nWe provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities. We make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and the resulting tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayers and respective governmental authorities. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available.\n\nOur DSCR for the reporting period ended December 31, 2017 was 4.01x (see Exhibit 12.1).\n\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) enacted in December 2017 lowered the Federal statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, beginning in 2018. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we revalued our net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. This revaluation reduced our 2017 net loss by $77.5 million, or $4.37 per share. We also expect to benefit meaningfully from the Tax Act in future periods, primarily due to the impact of the lower U.S. federal tax rate.\n \u2022 Advertising revenues increased due to the IHOP restaurant development noted above and an increase in the number of international restaurants of both brands participating in advertising funds. \nRevenue Recognition\nOur 2017 total franchise revenue declined $16.9 million compared to 2016. The significant components of the total change are as follows:\n2014 (the Variable Funding Note Purchase Agreement\u201d), among the Co-Issuers, the Guarantors, certain conduit investors, financial institutions and funding agents, and Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank, B.A. ( Rabobank Nederdland\u201d), New York Branch, as provider of letters of credit, as swingline lender and as administrative agent.\nGoodwill and intangible assets considered to have an indefinite life (primarily the Applebee's tradename) are evaluated throughout the year to determine if indicators of impairment exist. Such indicators include, but are not limited to, events or circumstances such as a significant adverse change in our business, in the business overall climate, unanticipated competition, a\nG&A expenses decreased $6.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to decreases in personnel-related costs of $6.7 million, in occupancy costs of $1.6 million and in consumer research costs of $0.7 million. Additionally, $1.5 million of the decline was due to additional expenses incurred in the 53rd week of 2015, primarily salaries, benefits and depreciation. The decrease in personnel-related costs is due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs of $7.2 million and lower costs of $1.8 million related to the consolidation of the Kansas City restaurant support center, partially offset by higher full-year costs of stock-based compensation, salary and benefits for several senior management positions that were filled during 2015. The decrease in occupancy costs was primarily due to the consolidation of the Kansas City restaurant support center. These favorable items were offset by higher costs of $3.0 million for professional services and $1.0 million for franchisee conferences.\n \u2022 Rental and financing gross profit was adversely impacted by the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \n \u2022 Company-operated restaurant gross profit declined primarily due to the refranchising of 23 Applebee's company-operated restaurants noted above. \n(5) In some instances, IHOP and Applebee's may be required to guarantee their purchase of any remaining inventory of certain food and other items purchased by CSCS.\nThe following are our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017:\n(2) There is no contractual obligation to pay a specific amount at a specific time. The amounts shown above represent our current best estimate of the timing as to settlement with a taxing authority or lapse of statutes of limitation.\nG&A expenses increased $16.7 million in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to charges of $8.8 million related to the executive separation costs discussed above under Events Impacting Comparability of Financial Information.\u201d Additionally, we incurred $8.6 million of costs related to Applebee's stabilization initiatives, primarily costs of third-party consultants engaged to assess the decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales, to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove an increase in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. All other G&A expenses declined $0.6 million, due primarily to a $1.5 million decrease in recruiting and relocation costs, a $1.1 million decrease in professional services and a $1.1 million decrease in conference and travel costs, partially offset by a $3.2 million increase in personnel-related costs. The increase in personnel-related costs was primarily due to salary and benefit costs for open management positions that were filled during 2016, partially offset by lower costs of incentive compensation.\nInterest Expense\nOur 2016 gross profit decreased $19.6 million compared to 2015, of which $9.4 million was due to a 53rd calendar week in 2015. Other components of the total change are as follows:\n \u2022 Applebee's franchise revenue decreased almost $20 million. A 5.3% decrease in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales reduced revenue by $8.3 million and there was a decrease of $6.2 million of royalty revenue due to uncertainty as to its collectibility. Restaurant closures reduced revenue by $4.1 million. Lower franchise termination and transfer fees also contributed to the decrease. \n \u2022 Franchise gross profit declined primarily due to a 5.0% decrease in Applebee's domestic franchise same-restaurant sales as well as lower franchise, extension and termination fees from both brands. These unfavorable items were partially offset by IHOP restaurant development and favorability in pancake and waffle dry mix. \nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with U.S. GAAP governing share-based payments. Accordingly, we measure stock-based compensation expense at the grant date, based on the fair value of the award, and recognize the expense over the employee's requisite service period using the straight-line method. The fair value of each employee stock option and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements. We currently use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock-based compensation. The Black-Scholes model meets the requirements of U.S. GAAP. The measurement of stock-based compensation expense is based on several criteria including, but not limited to, the valuation model used and associated input factors, such as expected term of the award, stock price volatility, risk free interest rate and forfeiture rate. These inputs are subjective and are determined using management's judgment. If differences arise between the assumptions used in determining stock-based compensation expense and the actual factors which become known over time, we may change the input factors used in determining future stock-based compensation expense. Any such changes could materially impact our operations in the period in which the changes are made and in subsequent periods.\nEvents Impacting Comparability of Financial Information\nsustained upon examination by taxing authorities including all appeals or litigation processes, based on its technical merits. A recognized tax position is then measured on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate resolution. For each reporting period, management applies a consistent methodology to measure and adjust all uncertain tax positions based on the available information.\nFinancing activities used net cash of $95.8 million during 2017. The primary uses of cash in financing activities consisted of cash dividends paid to stockholders totaling $69.8 million, repayments of capital lease obligations of $12.9 million, repurchases of our common stock totaling $10.0 million and a repayment of long-term debt of $3.25 million. These outflows were partially offset by a net cash inflow of $0.2 million related to equity awards. As discussed above under Class A-2 Notes,\u201d we must make a principal payment on long-term debt of $3.25 million each quarter if our leverage ratio is greater than 5.25x. We expect we will be required to make four such payments in 2018.\n \u2022 IHOP franchise expenses improved due primarily to favorability in pancake and waffle dry mix purchases partially offset by a $0.8 million franchisor contribution to the IHOP national advertising fund. \nDuring the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we declared and paid dividends on common stock as shown in Note 11 - Stockholders' Equity, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\n\nWe may voluntarily repay the Class A-2 Notes at any time; however, if we voluntarily repay the Class A-2 Notes prior to September 2018, we would be required to pay a make-whole premium. As of December 31, 2017, the make-whole payment for voluntary repayment was approximately $18 million; this amount declines ratably to zero in September 2018. We would also be subject to a make-whole premium in the event of a mandatory prepayment occurring prior to September 2018 following a Rapid Amortization Event or certain asset dispositions. The make-whole premium requirements are considered derivatives embedded in the Class A-2 Notes that must be bifurcated for separate valuation. We estimated the fair value of these derivatives to be immaterial as of December 31, 2017, based on the probability-weighted discounted cash flows associated with either event.\nImpairment of Applebee's Goodwill and Tradename\nIn the process of a quantitative test, if necessary, of the Applebee's tradename, we primarily use the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales, a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\nOn a regular basis, we assess whether events or changes in circumstances have occurred that potentially indicate the carrying value of intangible assets with finite lives, primarily assets related to Applebee's franchise rights. Recoverability of the asset is measured by comparing the assets' carrying value to the discounted future cash flows expected to be generated over the asset's remaining useful life. Significant factors considered include, but are not limited to, current and forecast sales, current and forecast cash flows and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.10x - Default Event\n \u2022 Increased franchise revenues due to IHOP restaurant development and sales of pancake and waffle dry mix were offset by a decrease in Applebee's franchise royalties primarily due to a 5.0% decline in same-restaurant sales and to lower franchise, extension and termination fees from both brands. \nApplebee's has experienced a decline in system-wide sales over the past two years that was primarily due to a decrease in customer traffic. This decline in sales at our franchisees' restaurants has adversely impacted the financial health of some of the franchisees and the timely payment of amounts they owe us for royalty payments and advertising fund contributions. The non-timely payments are primarily concentrated amongst four franchisees. Two franchisees representing approximately 13% of Applebee's 2017 domestic system-wide sales are exhibiting a higher level of financial difficulty than the other franchisees. These franchisee health issues, in turn, had an adverse impact on our 2017 financial results as follows: (i) our bad debt expense increased $11.5 million; (ii) we contributed $9.5 million to the Applebee's NAF to mitigate both the decline in franchisee contributions that are based on a percentage of restaurant sales and the non-timely payment by certain franchisees; and (iii) there was a decrease of $6.2 million in royalty revenue due to uncertainty as to its collectibility. We engaged third-party consultants during the first half of 2017 to assess the continued decline in Applebee's traffic and same-restaurant sales and to provide actionable recommendations to stabilize the decline and to assist with franchisee health initiatives. These recommendations were implemented and, in large part, drove the positive sales in the fourth quarter of 2017. We incurred approximately $8.6 million of costs related to these stabilization initiatives in 2017.\nOn September 30, 2014, Applebee's Funding LLC and IHOP Funding LLC (each a Co-Issuer\u201d), each a special purpose, wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company, issued $1.3 billion of Series 2014-1 4.277% Fixed Rate Senior Notes, Class A-2 (the Class A-2 Notes\u201d) in an offering exempt from registration under the Securities Act. The Co-Issuers also entered into a revolving financing facility of Series 2014-1 Variable Funding Senior Notes Class A-1 (the Variable Funding Notes\u201d), which allows for drawings of up to $100 million of Variable Funding Notes and the issuance of letters of credit. The Class A-2 Notes and the Variable Funding Notes are referred to collectively as the Notes.\u201d The Notes were issued in a securitization transaction pursuant to which substantially all of our domestic revenue-generating assets and our domestic intellectual property, are held by the Co-Issuers and certain other special-purpose, wholly-owned indirect subsidiaries of the Company (the Guarantors\u201d) that act as guarantors of the Notes and that have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure the Notes.\n (b) System-wide sales\u201d are retail sales at Applebee's restaurants operated by franchisees and IHOP restaurants operated by franchisees and area licensees, as reported to the Company, in addition to retail sales at company-operated restaurants. Sales at restaurants that are owned by franchisees and area licensees are not attributable to the Company. An increase in franchisees' reported sales will result in a corresponding increase in our royalty revenue, while a decrease in franchisees' reported sales will result in a corresponding decrease in our royalty revenue. Unaudited reported sales for Applebee's domestic franchise restaurants, IHOP franchise restaurants and IHOP area license restaurants for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows: \n___________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe Company incurred costs of $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 to exit a facility in connection with the consolidation of the Applebee's Kansas City restaurant support center. Of that total, $2.5 million related to the termination of our involvement in a lease covering two floors of the facility and $0.4 million was accrued as the present value of future lease payments, net of assumed sublease rentals, of a portion of one floor of the facility.\nIn October 2015, the Company's Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase up to $150 million of the Company's common stock (the 2015 Repurchase Program\u201d) on an opportunistic basis from time to time in open market transactions and in privately negotiated transactions based on business, market, applicable legal requirements and other considerations. The 2015 Repurchase Program, as approved by the Board of Directors, does not require the repurchase of a specific number of shares and can be terminated at any time. A summary of shares repurchased under the 2015 Repurchase Program, during the year ended December 31, 2017 and cumulatively, is as follows:\n(1) Favorable (unfavorable) variance in comparing 2016 and 2014 results with 2015 results that exclude the 53rd calendar week of 2015.\nWe make judgments as to whether uncertainty as to collectibility of the consideration that we are owed precludes recognition of the revenue on an accrual basis. These judgments are based on the facts specific to each circumstance. Primary factors considered include past payment history and our subjective assessment of the likelihood of receiving payment in the future.\nThe 2017 effective tax rate of 22.3% applied to pretax book loss was lower than the statutory Federal tax rate of 35% primarily due to the non-deductibility of the impairment of Applebee's goodwill for federal income tax purposes, which partially offsets with the income tax benefit resulted from the revaluation of our deferred taxes at the federal tax rate of 21% in accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. See Note 15 - Income Taxes, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on differences between our effective tax rate and the statutory Federal tax rate.\n \u2022 We recognized a substantial benefit associated with the December 2017 enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, primarily due to a one-time revaluation of our net deferred tax liability based on a U.S. federal tax rate of 21 percent. This revaluation reduced our net loss by $77.5 million, or $4.37 per share; \nThe DSCR ratio is Net Cash Flow for the four quarters preceding the calculation date divided by the total debt service payments of the preceding four quarters. The complete definitions of the DSCR and all calculation elements are contained in\n\u2022DSCR less than 1.20x - Manager Termination Event\nSee additional discussion of these impairments under the heading Financial Review - Impairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\u201d\nDomestic Same-Restaurant Sales Trends\n \u2022 Applebee's franchise expenses increased primarily because of a $2.5 million franchisor contribution to the Applebee's NAF and a $1.4 million increase in bad debt expense. \nOur 2017 total revenue declined $29.2 million compared to 2016. The significant components of the change are as follows:\nOur 2017 gross profit decreased $37.8 million compared to 2016. Primary components of the total change are as follows:\n\n \u2022 Applebee's franchise revenue decreased approximately $8 million due to a 5.0% decrease in Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales. Lower franchise termination and transfer fees and an increase in the amount of royalties we did not recognize due to uncertainty as to collectibility also contributed to the decrease. These unfavorable items were partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.9 million from a full year of royalty revenues in 2016 from 23 refranchised restaurants compared to six months of royalty revenue in 2015. \nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax accounting requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portions or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized. This test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets. The preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws. When we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, our income tax expense will increase or decrease, respectively, in the period such determination is made.\nIn determining the fair value of the Applebee's franchise reporting unit, we used the income approach method of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method and the market approach that includes the guideline public company method to determine the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets. Significant assumptions made by management in estimating fair value under the discounted cash flow model include future trends in sales, operating expenses, overhead expenses, depreciation, capital expenditures and changes in working capital, along with an appropriate discount rate based on our estimated cost of equity capital and after-tax cost of debt. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the guideline public company method include the selection of guideline companies and the valuation multiples applied. In determining the fair value of the Applebee's tradename, we used the relief of royalty method under the income approach method of valuation. Significant assumptions used to determine fair value under the relief of royalty method include future trends in sales, a royalty rate and a discount rate to be applied to the forecast revenue stream.\n(a) During the twelve months ending December 31, 2017, nine company-operated restaurants were refranchised and one was permanently closed.\nThe Variable Funding Notes were undrawn upon issuance on September 30, 2014 and we have not drawn on them since issuance. At December 31, 2017, approximately $3.1 million was pledged against the Variable Funding Notes for outstanding letters of credit, leaving $96.9 million of Variable Funding Notes available for borrowings. The letters of credit are used primarily to satisfy insurance-related collateral requirements.\nWhile the Notes are outstanding, payment of principal and interest is required to be made on the Class A-2 Notes on a quarterly basis. The quarterly principal payment of $3.25 million on the Class A-2 Notes may be suspended when the leverage ratio for the Company and its subsidiaries is less than or equal to 5.25x. In general, the leverage ratio is our indebtedness divided by adjusted EBITDA for the four preceding quarterly periods. The complete definitions of all calculation elements of the leverage ratio are contained in the Base Indenture filed as Exhibit 4.1 to our Form 8-K filed with the SEC on October 3, 2014 ( Base Indenture\u201d). Exceeding the leverage ratio of 5.25x does not violate any covenant related to the Notes. As of December 31, 2017, our leverage ratio was 5.70x (See Exhibit 12.1). We made one principal payment of $3.25 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and anticipate we will be required to make four quarterly principal payments during 2018.\n \u2022 Our gross profit decreased $37.8 million, primarily due to a decrease of $38.1 million in gross profit from Applebee's franchise operations. Nearly $29 million of the decline was due to Applebee's franchisee financial health issues, specifically, an $11.5 million increase in bad debt expense; an increase of $7.0 million in contributions we made to the \n \u2022 Applebee's franchise expenses increased primarily because of an $11.5 million increase in bad debt expense and an increase in franchisor marketing contributions. We contributed $9.5 million to the Applebee's NAF in 2017 to mitigate the decline in franchisee contributions that are based on a percentage of restaurant sales as compared to a $2.5 million contribution in 2016. \nIn evaluating the performance of Applebee's and IHOP, we consider the key performance indicators to be the percentage change in system-wide sales, the percentage change in domestic system-wide same-restaurant sales ( domestic same-restaurant sales\u201d) and net franchise restaurant development. Changes in both domestic same-restaurant sales and in the number of Applebee's and IHOP franchise restaurants directly impact the system-wide retail sales that drive our franchise royalty revenues. Restaurant development also impacts franchise revenue in the form of initial franchise fees and, in the case of IHOP restaurants, sales of proprietary pancake and waffle dry mix.\n\n\nManagement makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease, which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating, the rent holiday and/or escalations in payment that are taken into consideration when calculating straight-line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized. These judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation, amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used.\n \u2022 Advertising expenses increased concurrently with the increase in advertising revenues.  Advertising contributions designated for IHOP's national advertising fund and local marketing and advertising cooperatives, as well as advertising contributions from international franchise restaurants of both brands, are recognized as revenue and expense of franchise operations. Because we have less contractual control over Applebee's domestic advertising expenditures, Applebee's domestic national advertising fund activity is not recognized as franchise revenue and expense. However, effective with the January 1, 2018, adoption of accounting guidance promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board with respect to revenue recognition, we will include contributions to and expenditures from the Applebee's NAF as revenue and expense of franchise operations, as is currently done with contributions to and expenditures from the IHOP NAF. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe performed an interim quantitative test for impairment of Applebee's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in the third quarter of 2017. As a result of performing the interim quantitative test, we recognized an impairment of Applebee's goodwill of $358.2 million and an impairment of Applebee's tradename of $173.4 million.\nDomestically, Applebee's and IHOP franchise restaurants are located in all 50 states and two IHOP franchise restaurants are located in the District of Columbia. Internationally, IHOP restaurants are located in three United States territories and 13 countries outside of the United States; Applebee's restaurants are located in two United States territories and 15 countries outside of the United States. With over 3,700 restaurants combined, we believe we are the largest full-service restaurant company in the world. The June 19, 2017 issue of Nation's Restaurant News reported that IHOP and Applebee's were the largest restaurant systems in the family dining and casual dining categories, respectively, in terms of United States system-wide sales during 2016. This marks the tenth consecutive year our two brands have achieved the number one ranking in Nation's Restaurant News.\nCash provided by operating activities decreased $17.4 million in 2016 compared to 2015. Our net income plus the non-cash reconciling items shown in our statements of cash flows (primarily depreciation, deferred taxes and stock-based compensation) was essentially unchanged from 2015. However, net changes in working capital used cash of $12.4 million during 2016 as opposed to providing cash of $4.3 million during 2015. This unfavorable change of $16.8 million primarily resulted from two items unique to 2015 that did not recur in 2016: an increase in collections of gift card receivables due to the 53rd calendar week in fiscal 2015, partially offset by a $10.4 million reduction of interest payable because of payment of an additional two months of interest in 2015 due to our 2014 refinancing of debt.\n\n \u2022 IHOP franchise revenues improved primarily due to increases in effective franchise restaurants due to franchisee development and an increase in international sales. These favorable items were primarily offset by a $1.6 million decrease in sales of pancake and waffle dry mix and a 1.9% decrease in IHOP's domestic same-restaurant sales. \nYou should read the following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this report.\nInvesting Activities\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\n \u2022 Rental and financing revenues decreased primarily due to the progressive decline in interest income as financed receivables were repaid. \nLeases", "item_7_tables": "Table 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

the MD&A report:\n\n- Dine Brands Global owns and franchises the Applebee's and IHOP restaurant concepts. At the end of 2017, there were 1,936 Applebee's restaurants and 1,786 IHOP restaurants globally. \n\n- In 2017, Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales declined 5.3% while IHOP's declined 1.9%. Declines were due to decreases in customer traffic. \n\n- Franchise revenue declined in 2017 due to decreases in Applebee's royalty revenue from lower sales, restaurant closures, and uncertainty in collectibility from some franchisees. IHOP franchise revenue increased slightly.\n\n- The company incurred impairment charges of $358.2 million for Applebee's goodwill and $173.4 million for the Applebee's tradename in Q3 2017 due to declines in performance. \n\n- Net loss in 2017 was $330.5 million compared to $428.5 million in 2016, with the improvement primarily due to the impairment charges in 2016 vs 2017.\n\n- Adjusted free cash flow was $63 million in 2017 compared to -$59.5 million in 2016. Cash from operations increased due to lower net loss.\n\n- In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provided a one-time benefit of $77.5 million to the company by allowing revaluation of deferred tax liabilities at a lower federal tax rate.\n\n- The company returned $79.8 million to shareholders in 2017 through dividends and share repurchases.\n\nIn summary, the company's performance continued to be challenged in 2017, especially for the Applebee's brand, resulting in impairment charges. However, cash flows and net income improved compared to 2016."}
