Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which traditional and emerging financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We sell our solutions to regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs, alternative finance and leasing companies, or Alt-FIs, and financial technology companies, or FinTechs. Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust suites of digital banking, lending, leasing, and banking as a service, or BaaS, services that make it possible for End Users to transact and engage anytime, anywhere and on any device. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As such, we purpose-build our solutions to deliver compelling and consistent End User experiences across digital channels and to drive the success of our customers by optimizing their digital brands and enhancing End User acquisition, retention and engagement.\nThe effective delivery and management of secure and advanced digital solutions in the complex and heavily-regulated financial services industry requires significant resources, personnel and expertise. We provide digital solutions that are designed to be highly configurable, scalable and adaptable to the specific needs of our customers. We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are also designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers and their End Users.\nWe began by providing digital banking solutions to domestic RCFIs with the mission of empowering them to leverage technology to compete more effectively and to strengthen the communities and End Users they serve. To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to come from sales of our digital banking platform to RCFIs, and we continue to be focused on our founding mission of building stronger communities by strengthening their financial institutions. However, the continued proliferation and ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for digital services have driven increases in the number of providers, greater fragmentation of financial services markets and a broadening set of new and innovative digital services, creating challenges and opportunities in the markets served by RCFIs as well as emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. End Users increasingly expect to transact and engage with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. End Users also select digital solutions based on the quality and intuitiveness of the digital user experience.\nRCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities and capture End User engagement by providing new, innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences. Traditional financial services providers such as banks and credit unions are experiencing reduced End User engagement in their physical branches and increased End User engagement with their digital services and thus they are increasing their investment in digital services. Emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs are leveraging their digital focus and expertise and capitalizing on increased End User demand for digital financial services by creating new and expanding existing digital service offerings. This combined investment by traditional and emerging financial services providers is driving further competition, segmentation and innovation.\nWe deliver our solutions to the substantial majority of our customers using a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host our solutions in their own data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Our digital banking platform customers have numerous End Users, and those End Users can represent one or more Registered Users on our solutions. We generally price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers and the number of Registered Users utilizing our solutions. We generally earn additional revenues from our digital banking platform customers based on the number of transactions that Registered Users perform on our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. As a result, our revenues from digital banking platform customers grow as\nour customers buy more solutions from us and increase the number of Registered Users utilizing our solutions and as those users increase their number of transactions on our solutions. The structure and terms of the arrangements for our newer lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are varied, but we generally sell these solutions on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements.\nWe have achieved significant growth since our inception. During each of the past seven years, our average number of Registered Users per installed customer on our digital banking platform, or Installed Customer, has grown, and we have been able to sell additional solutions to existing customers. Our revenues per Installed Customer and per Registered User vary period-to-period based on the length and timing of customer implementations, changes in the average number of Registered Users per customer, sales of additional solutions to existing customers, changes in the number of transactions on our solutions by Registered Users and variations among existing customers and new customers with respect to the mix of purchased solutions and related pricing. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operation Measures\" for additional detail on how we define \"Installed Customers\" and \"Registered Users.\"\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our business, and we intend to invest across our organization to increase our revenues and improve our operating efficiencies. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute dollar basis, but the timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we expect to add new customers, the implementation and support needs of our customers, our software development plans, our technology infrastructure requirements and the internal needs of our organization. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our realizing any resultant benefit which may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources.\nIf we are successful in growing our revenues by increasing the number and scope of our customer relationships, we anticipate that greater economies of scale and increased operating leverage will improve our margins over the long term. We also anticipate that increases in the number of Registered Users for existing digital banking platform customers will improve our margins. However, we do not have any control or influence over whether End Users of our digital banking platform elect to become Registered Users of our customers' digital banking services.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our professional sales organization. While the RCFI market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, the Alt-FI and FinTech markets are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. We intend to add sales representatives to identify and address the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets across the U.S. and internationally. We also expect to increase our number of sales support and marketing personnel, as well as our investment in marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our solutions and generate new customer opportunities.\nWe have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past three years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functions that serve a broader range of needs of RCFIs as well as the needs of Alt-FIs and FinTechs. In addition to our acquisitions of Centrix and Social Money in 2015, on October 15, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Cloud Lending, Inc., or Cloud Lending, a provider of an end-to-end digital lending and leasing platform and on November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Gro Solutions, Inc., or Gro, a provider of digital account opening and digital sales and marketing solutions for financial institutions. Our solutions now include a broad range of services and experiences including corporate banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions both in the U.S. and internationally.\nWe believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party systems allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings across the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of RCFIs, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us in the market for digital financial services solutions. We intend to increase investments in technology innovation and software development as we enhance our solutions and platforms and increase or expand the number of solutions that we offer.\nWe believe that delivery of consistent, high-quality customer support is a significant driver of purchasing and renewal decisions of our prospects and customers. To develop and maintain a reputation for high-quality service, we seek to build deep relationships with our customers through our customer service organization, which we staff with personnel who are motivated by our common mission of using technology to help our customers succeed and who are knowledgeable with respect to the regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry. As we grow our business, we must continue to invest in and grow our services organization to support our customers' needs and maintain our reputation.\nKey Operating Measures\nIn addition to the United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measures described below in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results,\" we monitor the following operating measures to evaluate growth trends, plan investments and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts:\nInstalled Customers\nWe define Installed Customers as the number of customers on our digital banking platform from which we are currently recognizing revenues. The average size of our Installed Customers, measured in both Registered Users per Installed Customer and revenues per Installed Customer, has increased over time as our existing Installed Customers continue to add Registered Users and buy more solutions from us, and as we add larger RCFIs to our Installed Customer base. The net rate at which we add Installed Customers varies based on our implementation capacity, the size and unique needs of our customers, the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions, and customer attrition, including as a result of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions. We had 401, 382 and 385 Installed Customers on our digital banking platform as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRegistered Users\nWe define a Registered User as an individual related to an account holder of an Installed Customer on our digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. We price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of Registered Users, so as the number of Registered Users of our solutions increases, our revenues grow. Our average number of Registered Users per Installed Customer grows as our existing digital banking platform customers add more Registered Users and as we add larger RCFIs to our Installed Customer base. We anticipate that the number of Registered Users will grow at a faster rate than our number of Installed Customers. The rate at which our customers add Registered Users and the incremental revenues we recognize from new Registered Users vary significantly period-to-period based on the timing of our implementations of new customers and the timing of registration of new End Users. Our Installed Customers had approximately 12.8 million, 10.4 million and 8.6 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nRevenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our products and services over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate as the total revenues in a calendar year, excluding any revenues from solutions of businesses acquired during such year, from customers who were implemented on any of our solutions as of December 31 of the prior year, expressed as a percentage of the total revenues during the prior year from the same group of customers. Our revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year revenues of: the number of new customers implemented on any of our solutions during the prior year; the timing of our implementation of those new customers in the prior year; growth in the number of End Users on such solutions and changes in their usage of such solutions; sales of new products and services to our existing customers during the current year, excluding any products or services resulting from businesses acquired during such year; and customer attrition. The most significant drivers of changes in our revenue retention rate each year have historically been the number of new customers in the prior year and the timing of our implementation of those new customers. The timing of our implementation of new customers in the prior year is significant because we do not start recognizing revenues from new customers until they are implemented. If implementations are weighted more heavily in the first or second half of the prior year, our revenue retention rate will be lower or higher, respectively. Our use of revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate revenue retention rate differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our revenue retention rate was 114%, 122%, and 122% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nChurn\nWe utilize churn to monitor the satisfaction of our customers and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. We define churn as the amount of any monthly recurring revenue losses due to customer cancellations and downgrades, net of upgrades and additions of new solutions, during a year, divided by our monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the year. Cancellations refer to customers that have either stopped using our services completely or remained a customer but terminated a particular service. Downgrades are a result of customers taking less of a particular service or renewing their contract for\nidentical services at a lower price. Our annual churn has ranged from 5.1% to 3.5% over the last seven years, and we had annual churn of 5.0%, 4.9% and 5.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our use of churn has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate churn differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, certain costs related to our recent acquisitions, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, total other (income) expense, net, and unoccupied lease charges. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our overall operating performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA together with our GAAP financial measures including cash flow from operations and net loss. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of Net Loss to Adjusted EBITDA:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(35,397\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(26,164\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,354\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,199\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit from) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,803\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(314\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unoccupied lease charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(4,539\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenues\nRevenue-generating activities directly relate to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the substantial majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in our data centers or with our cloud-based hosting resources as well as revenues for implementation and customer support services related to our solutions, and we recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host our solutions in their own data centers under term license and maintenance agreements, and we recognize the software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license and corresponding maintenance revenues over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license.\nSubscription fees are based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the number of End Users using the solutions and the number of bill-pay and certain other transactions those users conduct using our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. Subscription fees are billed monthly, quarterly, or annually and are recognized monthly over the term of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. The structure and terms of the arrangements for our newer lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are varied, but we generally sell these solutions on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. We begin recognizing subscription fees when the control of the service transfers to the customer, generally when the solution is implemented and made available to the customer. The timing of our implementations varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. We recognize any related implementation services revenues ratably over the initial customer agreement term beginning on the date we commence recognizing subscription fees. Contract asset balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Amounts that have been invoiced but not paid are recorded in accounts receivable or other long-term assets, depending on the timing of expected billing, and in revenues or deferred revenues, depending on when control of the service transfers to the customer.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers. This includes the costs of our implementation, customer support, data center and customer training personnel, as well as costs related to research and development personnel who perform implementation and customer support services. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, the amortization of deferred solution and services costs, co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets, cloud-based hosting services, an allocation of general overhead costs, the amortization of acquired technology, and referral fees. We allocate general overhead expenses to all departments based on the number of employees in each department, which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation.\nWe capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solution to the extent those costs are considered to be recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for a particular implementation once revenue recognition commences, and we amortize those implementation costs over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred.\nWe capitalize certain software development costs related to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions. The costs related to software development that are incurred between reaching technological feasibility of a solution and the point at which the solution is ready for general release are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2017, all of the products related to capitalized software development costs reached general release, and we have commenced amortization of these costs. Capitalized software development costs are computed on an individual product basis and products available for market are amortized to cost of revenues over the products' estimated economic lives.\nWe intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation and customer support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our customers and support our growth. We expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business but to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues based principally on the level and timing of implementation and support activities and other related costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. They also include costs related to our acquisitions and the resulting amortization of acquired intangible assets from those acquisitions. We intend to continue to hire new employees and make other investments to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we grow our business.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including commissions, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will change in any given period based on several factors including the addition of newly-hired sales professionals, the number and timing of newly-installed customers and the amount of sales commissions expense amortized related to those customers. Commissions are generally capitalized and then amortized over the expected period of customer benefit.\nSales and marketing expenses are also impacted by the timing of significant marketing programs such as our annual user conference which we typically hold during the second quarter. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing our number of sales and marketing personnel and expanding our sales and marketing activities. We believe these investments will help us build brand awareness, add new customers and expand sales to our existing customers as they continue to buy more solutions from us, the number of End Users utilizing our solutions grows and those End Users increase the number of transactions they perform on our solutions.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that continuing to improve and enhance our solutions is essential to maintaining our reputation for innovation and growing our customer base and revenues. Research and development expenses include salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, software development costs, allocated overhead and other related expenses incurred in developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.\nCertain research and development costs that are related to our software development, which include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions, are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal and human resources employees. General and administrative expenses also include consulting and professional fees, insurance and travel. We expect to continue to incur incremental expenses associated with the growth of our business and to meet increased compliance requirements associated with operating as a public company. These expenses include costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance and investor relations activities.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs include compensation expenses related to milestone provisions and retention agreements with certain former shareholders and employees of acquired businesses which are recognized as earned, and various legal and professional service expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions, which were recognized when incurred.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles represent the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our business acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nUnoccupied Lease Charges\nUnoccupied lease charges include costs related to the early exit from a portion of our south Austin facility, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from that facility.\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\nTotal other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income and expense and loss on disposal of long-lived assets. We earn interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our convertible notes issued in February 2018, or Convertible Notes, fees and interest associated with the letter of credit issued to our landlord for the security deposit for our corporate headquarters, and the interest incurred on our previously existing credit facility which expired in April 2017.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nAs a result of our current net operating loss position, current income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state income taxes, deferred income tax expenses relating to the tax amortization of recently acquired goodwill, and the release of valuation allowance resulting in deferred tax benefits relating to acquired net deferred tax liabilities. We incurred minimal state income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $276.9 million and $168.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2026, if not utilized. We also held state tax credits of $1.2 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, federal alternative minimum tax credits of zero and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and federal R&D tax credits of $3.2 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The state tax credits will expire in 2026 if not utilized, the federal R&D tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in 2027, if not utilized, and the federal alternative minimum tax credits have an indefinite carryforward period.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of significant judgments and estimates by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement, generally when our solutions are implemented and made available to our customers. The promised consideration may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. Revenues are recognized net of sales credits and allowances.\nRevenue-generating activities are directly related to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or cloud-based hosting services, transaction revenue from bill-pay solutions, as well as revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions. We recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. We account for revenue in accordance with the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which was adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method.\nSubscription Fee Revenues\nA substantial majority of our software solutions are available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing perpetual rights to the software. Subscription fees from these applications, including contractual periodic price increases, are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term beginning on the date our solution is made available to the customer. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenues or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Periodic price increases are estimated at contract inception and result in contract assets as revenue recognition may exceed the amount billed early in the contract. Additional fees for monthly usage above the levels included in the standard subscription fee are recognized as revenue in the month when the usage amounts are determined and reported.\nA small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Term licenses sold with maintenance entitle the customer to technical support, upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis. Under the new revenue standard, we recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which generally occurs at the start of each license term. We recognize the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license. If the expected length of time between when we transfer the software license to the customer and when the customer pays for it results in a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money, which reflects the price the customer would have paid when the license was transferred. Revenues from term licenses and maintenance agreements and the related financing component were not significant in the periods presented.\nTransactional Revenues\nWe earn the majority of our transactional revenues based on the number of bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform. We also generate a smaller portion of our transactional revenues from interchange fees generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with our Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services and interchange fees in the month incurred based on actual transactions.\nServices and Other Revenues\nImplementation services are required for each new digital banking and lending and leasing platform and Centrix standalone contract, and there is a significant level of integration and configuration for each customer. Our revenue for upfront implementation services are billed upfront and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term for our hosted application agreements. Upfront implementation services for on-premises agreements are recognized at commencement date. Under certain circumstances, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support the installation and configuration process for our digital lending and leasing solutions, and therefore, we have determined that these services qualify as a separate performance obligation in certain markets and geographies, and the upfront implementation services for these agreements are recognized at commencement date.\nProfessional services revenues, which primarily consist of training, advisory services, core conversion services, web design, and other general professional services, are generally billed and recognized when delivered. Certain out-of-pocket expenses billed to customers are recorded as revenues rather than an offset to the related expense.\nSignificant Judgments\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of accounting in the new revenue standard. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have contracts with customers that often include multiple performance obligations, usually including multiple subscription and implementation services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct by allocating the contract's total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the relative standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct good or service in the contract. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, we considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the customer's personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. We have concluded that the implementation services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations in the North American banking market are not distinct and, as a result, we defer any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognize such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue for the initial agreement term of the hosted application agreements. We have concluded that outside the North American banking market, the implementation services for our lending\nand leasing platform included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct and, as a result, we recognize implementation fees on such arrangements as the related implementation services are performed.\nThe majority of our revenue recognized at a particular point in time is for professional services and usage revenue. These services are performed within a relatively short period of time and are recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon completion of the service.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The primary method used to estimate SSP is the adjusted market assessment approach, which considers its overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, its discounting practices, the size and volume of its transactions, customer characteristics, price lists, go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and agreement prices, and the number and types of End Users within its contracts.\nVariable Consideration\nWe recognize usage revenue related to End Users accessing our solutions in excess of contracted amounts, bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform, and interchange fees that End Users generate using our solutions. Judgment is required to determine the accounting for these types of revenue. We consider various factors including the degree to which usage is interdependent or interrelated to past services, costs to us per End User over the contract, contractual price per End User changes and their relationship to market terms, forecasted data, and our cost to fulfill the obligation. We have concluded that our usage revenue relates specifically to the transfer of the service to the customer and is consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606 when considering all of the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract. Therefore, we recognize usage revenue on a monthly or quarterly basis in accordance with the agreement, as determined and reported. This allocation reflects the amount we expect to receive for the services for the given period.\nWe sometimes provide credits or incentives to our customers. Known and estimable credits and incentives represent a form of variable consideration, which are estimated at contract inception and reduce the revenues recognized for a particular contract. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration as of December 31, 2018.\nOther Considerations\nWe evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis) with respect to the vendor reseller agreements pursuant to which we resell certain third-party solutions along with our solutions. Generally, we report revenues from these types of contracts on a gross basis, meaning the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenues, and expenses incurred are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we first obtain control of the inputs to the specific good or service and direct their use to create the combined output. Our control is evidenced by our involvement in the integration of the good or service on our solutions before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Revenues provided from agreements in which we are an agent are immaterial.\nDeferred Revenues\nDeferred revenues primarily consist of amounts that have been billed to or received from customers in advance of revenue recognition and prepayments received from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. We recognize deferred revenues as revenues when the services are performed and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed.\nOur payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\nWe capitalize certain personnel and other costs, such as employee salaries, benefits and the associated payroll taxes that are direct and incremental to the implementation of our solutions. We analyze implementation costs that may be capitalized to assess their recoverability, and only capitalize costs that we anticipate to be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our deferred implementation costs by comparing the greater of the amount of the non-cancellable portion of a customer's contract and the non-refundable customer prepayments received as it relates to the specific implementation costs incurred. We begin amortizing the deferred implementation costs for an implementation once the revenue recognition criteria have been met, and we amortize those deferred implementation costs ratably over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been\ndetermined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology.\nThe portion of deferred implementation costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred implementation costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred implementation costs, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheet.\nDeferred Solution and Other Costs\nWe capitalize sales commissions and other third-party costs, such as third-party licenses and maintenance related to our customer agreements. We capitalize sales commissions because the commission charges are so closely related to the revenues from the non-cancellable customer agreements that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. Under the new revenue standard, we capitalize commissions and bonuses for those involved in the sale, including direct employees and indirect supervisors, as these are incremental to the sale. We typically pay commissions in two increments. The initial payment is made after the contract has been executed and the initial deposit has been received from the customer, and the final payment is made upon commencement date. We require that an individual remain employed to collect a commission when it is due. The service period between the first and second payment is considered to be a substantive service period, and as a result, we expense the final payment when made. We begin amortizing deferred solution and other costs for a particular customer agreement once the revenue recognition criteria are met and amortize those deferred costs over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology.\nWe analyze solution and other costs that may be capitalized to assess their recoverability and only capitalize costs that we anticipate being recoverable. The portion of capitalized costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred solution and other costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred solution and other costs, net of current portion.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and deferred revenues (contract liabilities). Billings scheduled to occur after the performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue recognition has occurred result in contract assets. Contract assets that are expected to be billed during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded in contract assets, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded in contract assets, net of current portion on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period. A contract liability results when we receive prepayments or deposits from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed. We recognize contract liabilities as revenues when the services are performed, and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Contract liabilities that are expected to be recognized as revenues during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded in deferred revenues, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded in deferred revenue, net of current portion, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable are stated at net realizable value, including both billed and unbilled receivables to customers. Unbilled receivable balances included in accounts receivable arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Generally, billing for revenues related to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are included in our minimum subscription fee occurs in the month the revenue is recognized, resulting in accounts receivable. Billing for revenues relating to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are in excess of our minimum subscription fees are, generally, billed in the month following the month the revenues were earned, resulting in an unbilled receivable.\nWe assess the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable deemed uncollectable. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we did not provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts, as all amounts outstanding were deemed collectable. Historically, our collection experience has not varied significantly, and bad debt expenses have been insignificant.\nWe maintain a reserve for estimated sales credits issued to customers for billing disputes or other service-related reasons. This allowance is recorded as a reduction against current period revenues and accounts receivable. In estimating this allowance, we analyze prior periods to determine the amounts of sales credits issued to customers compared to the revenues in the period that related to the original customer invoice. This estimate is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock options, restricted stock units, and market stock units awarded to employees, directors, executives and consultants are measured at fair value at each grant date. As of January 1, 2017, we no longer use a forfeiture rate to recognize compensation expense as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting monthly over the following 36 months, and restricted stock unit awards vest in four annual installments of 25% each. Market stock units are performance-based awards that cliff vest based on our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index, or Index, over a three-year period on the anniversary of the date of grant. Up to one-third of the target shares of our common stock subject to each market stock unit award are eligible to be earned after the first and second years of the performance period and up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each market stock unit award are eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period (less any shares earned for years one and two) based on the average price of our common stock relative to the Index during the performance period.\nWe value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected stock price volatility, and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and end of the contractual term. We use the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Due to our limited history as a public company, expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends. We recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the stock option award.\nWe value restricted stock units at the closing market price on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the restricted stock unit award.\nWe estimate the fair value of market stock units on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of fair value of the market stock units is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatility and the risk-free interest rate. Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and peer firms' stocks and the Index over the performance period. We assumed no dividend yield and recognize compensation expense using the graded attribution method on a straight-line basis over the performance period of the market stock unit award.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn February 2018, we issued $230.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in February 2023, or the Convertible Notes. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we separated each of the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value, as of the date of issuance, of a similar debt without the conversion option. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the total initial proceeds. The difference between the par amount of the Convertible Notes and the carrying amount of the liability component represents debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in additional paid-in capital.\nPurchase Price Allocation, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe purchase price allocation for business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic\n805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\" as of January 1, 2017. Under ASU 2017-01, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is not a business. If it is not met, we determine whether the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, meets the definition of a business.\nIn connection with our acquisitions and asset purchase discussed in Note 3 - Business Combinations and Asset Acquisition, we recorded certain intangible assets, including acquired technology, customer relationships, trademarks, non-compete agreements and assembled workforce. Amounts allocated to the acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. We periodically review the estimated useful lives and fair values of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances which might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life.\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in October, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Because we operate in a single reporting unit, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level by comparing the estimated fair value of the company to the carrying value of the company. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a \"step one\" analysis using a fair-value-based approach based on the market capitalization or a discounted cash flow analysis of projected future results to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Determining the fair value of goodwill is subjective in nature and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions including, without limitation, use of estimates of future prices and volumes for our products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast. If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur impairment charges in a future period. The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2018. No impairment of goodwill was identified during 2018.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions. The costs related to software development that are incurred between reaching technological feasibility of a solution and the point at which the solution is ready for general release are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet. Capitalized software development costs are computed on an individual product basis, and products available for market are amortized to cost of revenues over the products' estimated economic lives.\nContingent Consideration\nCertain former stockholders of Cloud Lending have the right to receive an earnout payment based upon satisfaction of certain financial milestones. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earnout payment is calculated utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation method under the the option pricing model, and this amount is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated on a quarterly basis through a collaborative effort by our sales and finance departments. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the purchase price finalization will be recorded as acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized, and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction. To date, we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we believe the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of our forecasted future results. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment. We will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence and will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Upon enactment, we did not have any foreign subsidiaries and the international aspects of the Tax Act were not applicable.\nIn connection with the initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was primarily offset by application of our valuation allowance. We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act in 2017 and throughout 2018, recording provisional amount of $0.2 million related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, we completed our 2017 income tax returns and our accounting for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act with no adjustments to the provisional amount recorded at December 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in

Revenues increased by $47.1 million, or 24.3%, from $194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $241.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $36.5 million increase from the sale of additional solutions to new and existing customers and the growth in Registered Users from new and existing customers. In addition, $8.5 million of the increase was generated from increases in the number of transactions processed using our solutions, and $2.1 million of the increase was generated from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. The number of Registered Users on our online banking platform increased from 10.4 million at December 31, 2017 to 12.8 million at December 31, 2018. The increases for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included $7.7 million related to the adjustments from the new revenue standard.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Revenues increased by $43.8 million, or 29.1%, from $150.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $38.9 million increase from the growth in new Registered Users from a combination of strong customer retention, the purchase of additional solutions by existing customers and the addition of Registered Users from new Installed Customers. The remaining $4.9 million increase was generated from increases in the number of transactions processed using our solutions. The number of Registered Users on our digital banking platform increased from 8.6 million at December 31, 2016 to 10.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nWhile we anticipate that revenue growth from transactions processed by our solutions will increase in absolute dollars, we expect the year over year growth rate to be lower than in recent periods.\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table presents our cost of revenues for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 188: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017.

This increase was primarily attributable to a $11.7 million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure, which included $1.1 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. In addition, there was a $4.1 million increase in direct costs related to bill-pay transaction processing and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions which was related to the increase in the number of new Registered Users and transactions processed on our digital banking platform and increases in implementation and support expenses that are reimbursable from our customers, a $3.0 million increase in co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets resulting from the increased infrastructure necessary to support our expanding customer base, a $1.3 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our implementation and support departments, a $0.8 million increase in amortization of acquired customer technology from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018, a $0.8 million increase in travel and other discretionary expenses and a $0.6 million increase from capitalized services amortization.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016.

This increase was primarily attributable to a $10.1 million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure,\nwhich included a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. In addition, there was a $4.5 million increase in co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets resulting from the increased infrastructure necessary to support our expanding customer base, a $4.1 million increase in direct costs related to bill-pay transaction processing and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions which was related to the increase in the number of new Registered Users and transactions processed on our digital banking platform and increases in implementation and support expenses that are reimbursable from our customers, a $2.0 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our implementation and support departments, a $1.4 million increase from capitalized services amortization, and a $0.4 million increase in amortization of acquired customer technology. These increases were partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in travel and other discretionary expenses.\nWe defer certain payroll costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are considered to be recoverable from future revenues. However, a substantial portion of our implementation costs are not eligible for deferral and, as a result, are expensed in the period incurred. Costs related to implementations that have been deferred are amortized over the expected period of customer benefit. Additionally, we invest in personnel, business processes and systems infrastructure to standardize our business processes and drive future efficiency in our implementations, customer support and data center operations. We expect these investments will increase cost of revenues in absolute dollars as we continue to make investments in capacity and process improvement.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following tables present our operating expenses for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSales and Marketing\nTable 189: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,284\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,886\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017.

General and administrative expenses increased by $5.2 million, or 16.3%, from $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in personnel costs to support the growth of our business including the addition of certain senior executives. The increase in personnel costs includes a $4.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to general and\nadministrative expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. The remaining increase was attributable to a $0.7 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs. This increase was partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in professional services for legal and consulting fees and a $0.8 million decrease in sales tax expense and other miscellaneous charges.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs to comply with regulations governing public companies, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, investor relations activities, and costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to incur both increased external audit fees as well as additional spending to ensure continued regulatory and Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance. We expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over time as our revenues grow.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(%)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,913\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,075\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017.

The tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from utilization of the R&D tax credits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of investments in growing our business. The timing of our implementation activities and corresponding revenues from new customers are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our sales. Sales may tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in subsequent quarters but any resulting impact on our results of operation has been difficult to measure due to the timing of our implementations and overall growth in our business. The timing of our implementations also varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As a result, we and our customers are very deliberate and careful in\nour implementation activities to help ensure a successful roll-out of the solutions to End Users and increase the registration of new End Users. Unusually long or short implementations, for even a small number of customers, may result in short-term quarterly variability in our results of operations.\nOur quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our IPO, follow-on offerings, cash flows from operations and our February 2018 Convertible Note financing. At December 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and investments of $177.3 million.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,943\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,514\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,176\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities is primarily influenced by the amount and timing of customer receipts and vendor payments and by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business and increase in the number of installed customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $4.6 million, which consisted of non-cash adjustments of $61.8 million, offset by a net loss of $35.4 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $21.8 million. Cash outflows are the result of a $15.8 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $5.8 million increase in contract assets due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, a $4.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, a $1.4 million increase in other long-term assets from the addition of deferred tax assets, and a $1.1 million decrease in deferred rents and other long-term liabilities. Cash inflows were the result of a $4.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, a $1.8 million decrease in other prepaid assets, and a $0.7 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments in support of our expanding customer base and related growth in our technical infrastructure and expanded facilities.

Cash outflows are the result of a $10.5 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $4.4 million decrease in accrued liabilities mainly from the payment of milestone and retention bonuses related to the companies acquired in 2015, a $1.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, a $0.2 million increase in other long-term assets, and a $0.1 million decrease in deferred rents and other long-term liabilities. Cash inflows were the result of a $4.8 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, a $3.4 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments in support of our expanding customer base and related growth in our technical infrastructure and expanded facilities, and a $0.2 million decrease in other prepaid assets. Non-cash items consisted\nprimarily of $20.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $14.9 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and $7.5 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $3.4 million, which consisted of a net loss of $36.4 million, offset by cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.1 million and non-cash adjustments of $32.7 million. Cash inflows were the result of a $11.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of increased spending in support of our expanding customer base, related growth in our technical infrastructure and our expanding operations, a $9.6 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, and a $3.0 million increase in deferred rents and other accrued liabilities as a result of the tenant improvement allowances for our new facilities. Cash outflows are the result of a $13.2 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $3.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, and a $0.2 million increase in other prepaid assets. Non-cash items consisted primarily of $12.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $12.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.8 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, and $1.1 million of other non-cash items.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments, our recent acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment to support our growth, and costs incurred for the development of capitalized software. Purchases of property and equipment may vary period-to-period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations, data center and other technical infrastructure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $171.3 million, consisting primarily of $130.7 million for the acquisitions of Cloud Lending and Gro and release of the hold back from the asset acquisition in 2017, $75.7 million for the purchase of investments, and $13.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment. These outflows were partially offset by $48.4 million received from the maturities of investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $16.9 million, consisting primarily of $27.7 million for the purchase of investments, $12.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, $3.8 million for an asset purchase and release of the hold back from the Social Money acquisition, and a $1.0 million in capitalized software development costs.

These outflows were partially offset by $41.1 million received from the maturities of investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur recent financing activities have consisted primarily of our February 2018 Convertible Note financing, net proceeds from exercises of options to purchase our common stock, as well as payments on financing obligations and payments on capital lease obligations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $216.6 million, which was primarily due to the issuance of $223.2 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes, net of issuance costs, and the related sale of Warrants for $22.4 million, offset by the purchase of bond hedges for $41.7 million. In addition, cash flows from financing activities included $12.7 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $11.6 million, consisting solely of cash received from the exercise of stock options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.9 million, consisting primarily of $6.0 million from the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $4.9 million of payments on financing obligations and $0.2 million of payments on capital lease obligations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of the Convertible Notes, non-cancelable operating leases related to our facilities, minimum purchase commitments for third-party products, co-location fees and other product costs. In February 2018, we issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Notes due February 15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We are also party to several purchase commitments for third-party products that contain both a contractual minimum obligation and a variable obligation based upon usage or other factors which can change on a monthly basis. The estimated amounts for usage and other factors are not included within the table below.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payment due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Convertible Notes, including interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,175\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>237,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>258,875\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339,055\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled to when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 was modified by subsequently issued ASUs 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-12 and 2016-20. Topic 606 also includes Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Collectively, we refer to ASU 2014-09, as amended, and Subtopic 340-40 as the \"new revenue standard.\" On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard for all contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in changes to our accounting policies for revenue recognition, contract balances, accounts receivable, deferred revenues, deferred implementation costs, and deferred solution and other costs. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as a positive adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of $15.8 million, which reflects the acceleration of revenues and deferral of incremental commission costs of obtaining subscription contracts. The comparative information in prior periods presented has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the impact of this adoption.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, \"Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases),\" which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard. In July 2018, the FASB also issued ASU 2018-11, \"Targeted Improvements,\" which provides the option to adopt ASU No. 2016-02 retrospectively for each prior period presented or as of the adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. These standards are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted. We anticipate that the adoption of Topic 842 will impact our consolidated balance sheets as most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities upon the adoption of Topic 842, which will increase the total assets and total liabilities that we report relative to such amounts prior to adoption. We intend to adopt the standard using the adoption method outlined in ASU 2018-11, which allows entities to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We intend to elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within Topic\n842, which among other things, will allow us to carry forward the historical lease classification and the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components of an agreement. We expect the adoption of Topic 842 to result in the recording of additional net lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $26 million to $28 million and approximately $35 million to $37 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The difference between the additional lease assets and lease liabilities is the reclassification of deferred rent on our balance sheet at the date of adoption. We do not expect the standard to impact the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss or the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\" to clarify and provide specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not addressed by current GAAP and thereby reduce the current diversity in practice. We adopted ASU 2016-15, effective January 1, 2018, and there was no impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\" which provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. We adopted this ASU retrospectively, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we included restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows, resulting in an increase in net cash of $1.8 million for fiscal 2018 and $2.3 million for fiscal 2017.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires an entity to write down the carrying value of goodwill up to the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718),\" to provide clarity and reduce both diversity in practice and cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIn December 2017, the SEC issued SAB 118 to address the application of GAAP in situations in which a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SEC Update),\" which amended ASC 740 to incorporate the requirements of SAB 118. Disclosures related to the effect of the Tax Act and our utilization of SAB 118 appear in Note 14 - Income Taxes.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, \"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40),\" which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 will be effective beginning in our first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted. The ASU may be applied retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We are anticipating early adoption of the ASU for January 1, 2019 and are currently evaluating the financial statement impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.", "item_7_truncated": "For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $16.9 million, consisting primarily of $27.7 million for the purchase of investments, $12.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, $3.8 million for an asset purchase and release of the hold back from the Social Money acquisition, and a $1.0 million in capitalized software development costs. These outflows were partially offset by $27.9 million received from the maturities of investments.\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,729\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,837\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stock-based compensation expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nadministrative expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price.

A contract liability results when we receive prepayments or deposits from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed. We recognize contract liabilities as revenues when the services are performed, and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized, and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction. To date, we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we believe the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of our forecasted future results. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment. We will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence and will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171,292\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,943\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,514\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>216,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>944\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>49,880\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,088\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12,176\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur principal commitments consist of the Convertible Notes, non-cancelable operating leases related to our facilities, minimum purchase commitments for third-party products, co-location fees and other product costs.

revenues are derived from customers which host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Term licenses sold with maintenance entitle the customer to technical support, upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis. Under the new revenue standard, we recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which generally occurs at the start of each license term. We recognize the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license. If the expected length of time between when we transfer the software license to the customer and when the customer pays for it results in a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money, which reflects the price the customer would have paid when the license was transferred. Revenues from term licenses and maintenance agreements and the related financing component were not significant in the periods presented.\nWe began by providing digital banking solutions to domestic RCFIs with the mission of empowering them to leverage technology to compete more effectively and to strengthen the communities and End Users they serve. To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to come from sales of our digital banking platform to RCFIs, and we continue to be focused on our founding mission of building stronger communities by strengthening their financial institutions. However, the continued proliferation and ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for digital services have driven increases in the number of providers, greater fragmentation of financial services markets and a broadening set of new and innovative digital services, creating challenges and opportunities in the markets served by RCFIs as well as emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. End Users increasingly expect to transact and engage with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. End Users also select digital solutions based on the quality and intuitiveness of the digital user experience.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Revenues increased by $43.8 million, or 29.1%, from $150.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $38.9 million increase from the growth in new Registered Users from a combination of strong customer retention, the purchase of additional solutions by existing customers and the addition of Registered Users from new Installed Customers. The remaining $4.9 million increase was generated from increases in the number of transactions processed using our solutions. The number of Registered Users on our digital banking platform increased from 8.6 million at December 31, 2016 to 10.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nRevenue-generating activities are directly related to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or cloud-based hosting services, transaction revenue from bill-pay solutions, as well as revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions. We recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. We account for revenue in accordance with the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which was adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will change in any given period based on several factors including the addition of newly-hired sales professionals, the number and timing of newly-installed customers and the amount of sales commissions expense amortized related to those customers. Commissions are generally capitalized and then amortized over the expected period of customer benefit.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Total other income (expense), net increased by $0.6 million from expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of a decrease of $0.4 million of interest expense from the expiration of our previously existing credit facility in 2017 and an increase of $0.2 million of interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\n\n\nOverview\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses increased by $7.9 million, or 24.3%, from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4.9 million increase in personnel costs as a result of the growth in our research and development organization for continued enhancements to our solutions, which includes a $1.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. An additional $1.7 million of the increase resulted from the reduction of capitalization of research and development salaries as software development costs during 2017 because all products previously being capitalized reached general release during 2017 and a $1.5 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in travel and other discretionary expenses.\nWe evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis) with respect to the vendor reseller agreements pursuant to which we resell certain third-party solutions along with our solutions. Generally, we report revenues from these types of contracts on a gross basis, meaning the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenues, and expenses incurred are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we first obtain control of the inputs to the specific good or service and direct their use to create the combined output. Our control is evidenced by our involvement in the integration of the good or service on our solutions before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Revenues provided from agreements in which we are an agent are immaterial.\nWe believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party systems allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings across the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of RCFIs, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us in the market for digital financial services solutions. We intend to increase investments in technology innovation and software development as we enhance our solutions and platforms and increase or expand the number of solutions that we offer.\nDeferred Solution and Other Costs\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in October, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Because we operate in a single reporting unit, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level by comparing the estimated fair value of the company to the carrying value of the company. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a \"step one\" analysis using a fair-value-based approach based on the market capitalization or a discounted cash flow analysis of projected future results to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Determining the fair value of goodwill is subjective in nature and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions including, without limitation, use of estimates of future prices and volumes for our products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast. If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur impairment charges in a future period. The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2018. No impairment of goodwill was identified during 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $9.5 million, which consisted of non-cash adjustments of $43.4 million, offset by a net loss of $26.2 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.7 million. Cash outflows are the result of a $10.5 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $4.4 million decrease in accrued liabilities mainly from the payment of milestone and retention bonuses related to the companies acquired in 2015, a $1.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, a $0.2 million increase in other long-term assets, and a $0.1 million decrease in deferred rents and other long-term liabilities. Cash inflows were the result of a $4.8 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, a $3.4 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments in support of our expanding customer base and related growth in our technical infrastructure and expanded facilities, and a $0.2 million decrease in other prepaid assets. Non-cash items consisted\nSales and marketing expenses are also impacted by the timing of significant marketing programs such as our annual user conference which we typically hold during the second quarter. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing our number of sales and marketing personnel and expanding our sales and marketing activities. We believe these investments will help us build brand awareness, add new customers and expand sales to our existing customers as they continue to buy more solutions from us, the number of End Users utilizing our solutions grows and those End Users increase the number of transactions they perform on our solutions.\nCost of Revenues\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement, generally when our solutions are implemented and made available to our customers. The promised consideration may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. Revenues are recognized net of sales credits and allowances.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The primary method used to estimate SSP is the adjusted market assessment approach, which considers its overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, its discounting practices, the size and volume of its transactions, customer characteristics, price lists, go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and agreement prices, and the number and types of End Users within its contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $3.4 million, which consisted of a net loss of $36.4 million, offset by cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.1 million and non-cash adjustments of $32.7 million. Cash inflows were the result of a $11.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of increased spending in support of our expanding customer base, related growth in our technical infrastructure and our expanding operations, a $9.6 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, and a $3.0 million increase in deferred rents and other accrued liabilities as a result of the tenant improvement allowances for our new facilities. Cash outflows are the result of a $13.2 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $3.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, and a $0.2 million increase in other prepaid assets. Non-cash items consisted primarily of $12.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $12.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.8 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, and $1.1 million of other non-cash items.\nThe majority of our revenue recognized at a particular point in time is for professional services and usage revenue. These services are performed within a relatively short period of time and are recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon completion of the service.\nDeferred revenues primarily consist of amounts that have been billed to or received from customers in advance of revenue recognition and prepayments received from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. We recognize deferred revenues as revenues when the services are performed and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nA substantial majority of our software solutions are available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing perpetual rights to the software. Subscription fees from these applications, including contractual periodic price increases, are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term beginning on the date our solution is made available to the customer. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenues or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Periodic price increases are estimated at contract inception and result in contract assets as revenue recognition may exceed the amount billed early in the contract. Additional fees for monthly usage above the levels included in the standard subscription fee are recognized as revenue in the month when the usage amounts are determined and reported.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.9 million, consisting primarily of $6.0 million from the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $4.9 million of payments on financing obligations and $0.2 million of payments on capital lease obligations.\nWe value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected stock price volatility, and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and end of the contractual term. We use the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Due to our limited history as a public company, expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends. We recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the stock option award.\nOperating Expenses\n (3) Unoccupied lease charges in 2018 include costs related to the early exit from of a portion of our south Austin facility, and in 2016 include the early exit from our previous Lincoln, Nebraska facility, partially offset by sublease income from those facilities.  Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of the line items in the tables above.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\n (3) Unoccupied lease charges in 2018 include costs related to the early exit from of a portion of our south Austin facility, and in 2016 include the early exit from our previous Lincoln, Nebraska facility, partially offset by sublease income from those facilities.  The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles represent the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our business acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our products and services over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate as the total revenues in a calendar year, excluding any revenues from solutions of businesses acquired during such year, from customers who were implemented on any of our solutions as of December 31 of the prior year, expressed as a percentage of the total revenues during the prior year from the same group of customers. Our revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year revenues of: the number of new customers implemented on any of our solutions during the prior year; the timing of our implementation of those new customers in the prior year; growth in the number of End Users on such solutions and changes in their usage of such solutions; sales of new products and services to our existing customers during the current year, excluding any products or services resulting from businesses acquired during such year; and customer attrition. The most significant drivers of changes in our revenue retention rate each year have historically been the number of new customers in the prior year and the timing of our implementation of those new customers. The timing of our implementation of new customers in the prior year is significant because we do not start recognizing revenues from new customers until they are implemented. If implementations are weighted more heavily in the first or second half of the prior year, our revenue retention rate will be lower or higher, respectively. Our use of revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate revenue retention rate differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our revenue retention rate was 114%, 122%, and 122% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled to when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 was modified by subsequently issued ASUs 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-12 and 2016-20. Topic 606 also includes Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Collectively, we refer to ASU 2014-09, as amended, and Subtopic 340-40 as the \"new revenue standard.\" On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard for all contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in changes to our accounting policies for revenue recognition, contract balances, accounts receivable, deferred revenues, deferred implementation costs, and deferred solution and other costs. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as a positive adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of $15.8 million, which reflects the acceleration of revenues and deferral of incremental commission costs of obtaining subscription contracts. The comparative information in prior periods presented has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the impact of this adoption.\ndetermined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology.\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nStock-Based Compensation\nAcquisition Related Costs\nIn December 2017, the SEC issued SAB 118 to address the application of GAAP in situations in which a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SEC Update),\" which amended ASC 740 to incorporate the requirements of SAB 118. Disclosures related to the effect of the Tax Act and our utilization of SAB 118 appear in Note 14 - Income Taxes.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs to comply with regulations governing public companies, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, investor relations activities, and costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to incur both increased external audit fees as well as additional spending to ensure continued regulatory and Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance. We expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over time as our revenues grow.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Acquisition related costs decreased by $5.1 million, or 80.5%, from $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised of compensation expense related to the remaining retention bonuses for employees of the companies acquired in 2015, while the expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $4.4 million of compensation expense related to the milestone provisions for certain former Centrix shareholders, $1.7 million related to retention bonuses for employees of the companies acquired in 2015, and $0.2 million of legal and other expenses incurred related to the acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid out $6.0 million to former Centrix shareholders, based upon the achievement of certain milestone-based objectives and $1.4 million in retention bonuses based upon continued employment.\nWe have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past three years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functions that serve a broader range of needs of RCFIs as well as the needs of Alt-FIs and FinTechs. In addition to our acquisitions of Centrix and Social Money in 2015, on October 15, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Cloud Lending, Inc., or Cloud Lending, a provider of an end-to-end digital lending and leasing platform and on November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Gro Solutions, Inc., or Gro, a provider of digital account opening and digital sales and marketing solutions for financial institutions. Our solutions now include a broad range of services and experiences including corporate banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions both in the U.S. and internationally.\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired; \nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, \"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40),\" which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 will be effective beginning in our first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted. The ASU may be applied retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We are anticipating early adoption of the ASU for January 1, 2019 and are currently evaluating the financial statement impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nWhile we anticipate that revenue growth from transactions processed by our solutions will increase in absolute dollars, we expect the year over year growth rate to be lower than in recent periods.\n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.  Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA together with our GAAP financial measures including cash flow from operations and net loss. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Research and development expenses increased by $11.0 million, or 27.3%, from $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $8.5 million increase in personnel costs as a result of the growth in our research and development organization for continued enhancements to our solutions, which includes a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price and $0.9 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. An additional $1.0 million of the increase resulted from the reduction of capitalization of research and development salaries as software development costs during 2018 because all products previously being capitalized reached general release during 2017, a $0.7 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs, and a $0.7 million increase in travel and other discretionary expenses.\n \u2022 our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our overall operating performance.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther Considerations\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, certain costs related to our recent acquisitions, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, total other (income) expense, net, and unoccupied lease charges. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal and human resources employees. General and administrative expenses also include consulting and professional fees, insurance and travel. We expect to continue to incur incremental expenses associated with the growth of our business and to meet increased compliance requirements associated with operating as a public company. These expenses include costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance and investor relations activities.\nImplementation services are required for each new digital banking and lending and leasing platform and Centrix standalone contract, and there is a significant level of integration and configuration for each customer. Our revenue for upfront implementation services are billed upfront and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term for our hosted application agreements. Upfront implementation services for on-premises agreements are recognized at commencement date. Under certain circumstances, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support the installation and configuration process for our digital lending and leasing solutions, and therefore, we have determined that these services qualify as a separate performance obligation in certain markets and geographies, and the upfront implementation services for these agreements are recognized at commencement date.\nWe maintain a reserve for estimated sales credits issued to customers for billing disputes or other service-related reasons. This allowance is recorded as a reduction against current period revenues and accounts receivable. In estimating this allowance, we analyze prior periods to determine the amounts of sales credits issued to customers compared to the revenues in the period that related to the original customer invoice. This estimate is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary.\n\nWe defer certain payroll costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are considered to be recoverable from future revenues. However, a substantial portion of our implementation costs are not eligible for deferral and, as a result, are expensed in the period incurred. Costs related to implementations that have been deferred are amortized over the expected period of customer benefit. Additionally, we invest in personnel, business processes and systems infrastructure to standardize our business processes and drive future efficiency in our implementations, customer support and data center operations. We expect these investments will increase cost of revenues in absolute dollars as we continue to make investments in capacity and process improvement.\nWe assess the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable deemed uncollectable. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we did not provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts, as all amounts outstanding were deemed collectable. Historically, our collection experience has not varied significantly, and bad debt expenses have been insignificant.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Revenues increased by $47.1 million, or 24.3%, from $194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $241.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $36.5 million increase from the sale of additional solutions to new and existing customers and the growth in Registered Users from new and existing customers. In addition, $8.5 million of the increase was generated from increases in the number of transactions processed using our solutions, and $2.1 million of the increase was generated from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. The number of Registered Users on our online banking platform increased from 10.4 million at December 31, 2017 to 12.8 million at December 31, 2018. The increases for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included $7.7 million related to the adjustments from the new revenue standard.\nChurn\nidentical services at a lower price. Our annual churn has ranged from 5.1% to 3.5% over the last seven years, and we had annual churn of 5.0%, 4.9% and 5.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our use of churn has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate churn differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nRevenue-generating activities directly relate to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the substantial majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in our data centers or with our cloud-based hosting resources as well as revenues for implementation and customer support services related to our solutions, and we recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host our solutions in their own data centers under term license and maintenance agreements, and we recognize the software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license and corresponding maintenance revenues over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license.\n (1) Includes amortization of acquired technology of $4.5 million, $3.6 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to support and expand our platform and enhance our existing solutions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses increased by $5.2 million, or 16.3%, from $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in personnel costs to support the growth of our business including the addition of certain senior executives. The increase in personnel costs includes a $4.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to general and\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million, consisting primarily of $40.2 million for the purchase of investments, $14.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, $2.7 million in capitalized software development costs and $0.3 million from the purchase of other intangible assets. These outflows were partially offset by $41.1 million received from the maturities of investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nSales and Marketing\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Amortization of acquired intangibles was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The acquired intangible assets are related to our business combinations in 2015 and asset purchase in 2017, and these amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nThe portion of deferred implementation costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred implementation costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred implementation costs, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheet.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nServices and Other Revenues\nWe deliver our solutions to the substantial majority of our customers using a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host our solutions in their own data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Our digital banking platform customers have numerous End Users, and those End Users can represent one or more Registered Users on our solutions. We generally price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers and the number of Registered Users utilizing our solutions. We generally earn additional revenues from our digital banking platform customers based on the number of transactions that Registered Users perform on our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. As a result, our revenues from digital banking platform customers grow as\nSources of Liquidity\nTotal other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income and expense and loss on disposal of long-lived assets. We earn interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our convertible notes issued in February 2018, or Convertible Notes, fees and interest associated with the letter of credit issued to our landlord for the security deposit for our corporate headquarters, and the interest incurred on our previously existing credit facility which expired in April 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Total other income (expense), net decreased by $7.8 million from income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an expense of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a $10.0 million increase in interest expense from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our Convertible Notes issued in February 2018, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nOperating Expenses\n\nUnoccupied lease charges include costs related to the early exit from a portion of our south Austin facility, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from that facility.\nUnoccupied Lease Charges\nWe believe that delivery of consistent, high-quality customer support is a significant driver of purchasing and renewal decisions of our prospects and customers. To develop and maintain a reputation for high-quality service, we seek to build deep relationships with our customers through our customer service organization, which we staff with personnel who are motivated by our common mission of using technology to help our customers succeed and who are knowledgeable with respect to the regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry. As we grow our business, we must continue to invest in and grow our services organization to support our customers' needs and maintain our reputation.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\" to clarify and provide specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not addressed by current GAAP and thereby reduce the current diversity in practice. We adopted ASU 2016-15, effective January 1, 2018, and there was no impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIf we are successful in growing our revenues by increasing the number and scope of our customer relationships, we anticipate that greater economies of scale and increased operating leverage will improve our margins over the long term. We also anticipate that increases in the number of Registered Users for existing digital banking platform customers will improve our margins. However, we do not have any control or influence over whether End Users of our digital banking platform elect to become Registered Users of our customers' digital banking services.\nIn February 2018, we issued $230.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in February 2023, or the Convertible Notes. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we separated each of the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value, as of the date of issuance, of a similar debt without the conversion option. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the total initial proceeds. The difference between the par amount of the Convertible Notes and the carrying amount of the liability component represents debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in additional paid-in capital.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, \"Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases),\" which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard. In July 2018, the FASB also issued ASU 2018-11, \"Targeted Improvements,\" which provides the option to adopt ASU No. 2016-02 retrospectively for each prior period presented or as of the adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. These standards are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted. We anticipate that the adoption of Topic 842 will impact our consolidated balance sheets as most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities upon the adoption of Topic 842, which will increase the total assets and total liabilities that we report relative to such amounts prior to adoption. We intend to adopt the standard using the adoption method outlined in ASU 2018-11, which allows entities to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We intend to elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within Topic\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $4.9 million, or 13.5%, from $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $3.7 million increase in personnel costs due to the growth of our sales and marketing organizations. The increase in personnel costs includes a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to sales and marketing for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. In addition, there was a $0.5 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our sales and marketing departments, a $0.4 million increase in discretionary marketing spend as a result of efforts to drive brand awareness and expanded marketing efforts to attract new customers and retain and grow existing customers and a $0.3 million increase in travel related expenses due to increased employee travel to attract new customers and efforts to support our sales and marketing initiatives.\nStock options, restricted stock units, and market stock units awarded to employees, directors, executives and consultants are measured at fair value at each grant date. As of January 1, 2017, we no longer use a forfeiture rate to recognize compensation expense as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting monthly over the following 36 months, and restricted stock unit awards vest in four annual installments of 25% each. Market stock units are performance-based awards that cliff vest based on our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index, or Index, over a three-year period on the anniversary of the date of grant. Up to one-third of the target shares of our common stock subject to each market stock unit award are eligible to be earned after the first and second years of the performance period and up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each market stock unit award are eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period (less any shares earned for years one and two) based on the average price of our common stock relative to the Index during the performance period.\n\nWe have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our IPO, follow-on offerings, cash flows from operations and our February 2018 Convertible Note financing. At December 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and investments of $177.3 million.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires an entity to write down the carrying value of goodwill up to the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSoftware development costs include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions. The costs related to software development that are incurred between reaching technological feasibility of a solution and the point at which the solution is ready for general release are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet. Capitalized software development costs are computed on an individual product basis, and products available for market are amortized to cost of revenues over the products' estimated economic lives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $216.6 million, which was primarily due to the issuance of $223.2 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes, net of issuance costs, and the related sale of Warrants for $22.4 million, offset by the purchase of bond hedges for $41.7 million. In addition, cash flows from financing activities included $12.7 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options.\nWe utilize churn to monitor the satisfaction of our customers and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. We define churn as the amount of any monthly recurring revenue losses due to customer cancellations and downgrades, net of upgrades and additions of new solutions, during a year, divided by our monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the year. Cancellations refer to customers that have either stopped using our services completely or remained a customer but terminated a particular service. Downgrades are a result of customers taking less of a particular service or renewing their contract for\nWe define Installed Customers as the number of customers on our digital banking platform from which we are currently recognizing revenues. The average size of our Installed Customers, measured in both Registered Users per Installed Customer and revenues per Installed Customer, has increased over time as our existing Installed Customers continue to add Registered Users and buy more solutions from us, and as we add larger RCFIs to our Installed Customer base. The net rate at which we add Installed Customers varies based on our implementation capacity, the size and unique needs of our customers, the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions, and customer attrition, including as a result of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions. We had 401, 382 and 385 Installed Customers on our digital banking platform as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenues increased by $22.1 million, or 28.5%, from $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $10.1 million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure,\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nTransactional Revenues\nSales and Marketing\n\nIn addition to the United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measures described below in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results,\" we monitor the following operating measures to evaluate growth trends, plan investments and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts:\nThe following table presents our cost of revenues for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our business, and we intend to invest across our organization to increase our revenues and improve our operating efficiencies. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute dollar basis, but the timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we expect to add new customers, the implementation and support needs of our customers, our software development plans, our technology infrastructure requirements and the internal needs of our organization. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our realizing any resultant benefit which may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources.\nResearch and Development\n (2) Includes stock-based compensation expenses as follows (in thousands): \nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nThe following tables present our operating expenses for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue Retention Rate\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. They also include costs related to our acquisitions and the resulting amortization of acquired intangible assets from those acquisitions. We intend to continue to hire new employees and make other investments to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we grow our business.\nour customers buy more solutions from us and increase the number of Registered Users utilizing our solutions and as those users increase their number of transactions on our solutions. The structure and terms of the arrangements for our newer lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are varied, but we generally sell these solutions on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements.\n\nVariable Consideration\nCost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers. This includes the costs of our implementation, customer support, data center and customer training personnel, as well as costs related to research and development personnel who perform implementation and customer support services. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, the amortization of deferred solution and services costs, co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets, cloud-based hosting services, an allocation of general overhead costs, the amortization of acquired technology, and referral fees. We allocate general overhead expenses to all departments based on the number of employees in each department, which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Cost of revenues increased by $22.4 million, or 22.5%, from $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $11.7 million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure, which included $1.1 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. In addition, there was a $4.1 million increase in direct costs related to bill-pay transaction processing and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions which was related to the increase in the number of new Registered Users and transactions processed on our digital banking platform and increases in implementation and support expenses that are reimbursable from our customers, a $3.0 million increase in co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets resulting from the increased infrastructure necessary to support our expanding customer base, a $1.3 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our implementation and support departments, a $0.8 million increase in amortization of acquired customer technology from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018, a $0.8 million increase in travel and other discretionary expenses and a $0.6 million increase from capitalized services amortization.\nIn connection with our acquisitions and asset purchase discussed in Note 3 - Business Combinations and Asset Acquisition, we recorded certain intangible assets, including acquired technology, customer relationships, trademarks, non-compete agreements and assembled workforce. Amounts allocated to the acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. We periodically review the estimated useful lives and fair values of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances which might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life.\nAccounts receivable are stated at net realizable value, including both billed and unbilled receivables to customers. Unbilled receivable balances included in accounts receivable arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Generally, billing for revenues related to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are included in our minimum subscription fee occurs in the month the revenue is recognized, resulting in accounts receivable. Billing for revenues relating to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are in excess of our minimum subscription fees are, generally, billed in the month following the month the revenues were earned, resulting in an unbilled receivable.\n\nResearch and Development \n\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nIn connection with the initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was primarily offset by application of our valuation allowance. We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act in 2017 and throughout 2018, recording provisional amount of $0.2 million related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, we completed our 2017 income tax returns and our accounting for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act with no adjustments to the provisional amount recorded at December 31, 2017.\nRevenues\nContingent Consideration\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $4.6 million, which consisted of non-cash adjustments of $61.8 million, offset by a net loss of $35.4 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $21.8 million. Cash outflows are the result of a $15.8 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $5.8 million increase in contract assets due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, a $4.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, a $1.4 million increase in other long-term assets from the addition of deferred tax assets, and a $1.1 million decrease in deferred rents and other long-term liabilities. Cash inflows were the result of a $4.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, a $1.8 million decrease in other prepaid assets, and a $0.7 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments in support of our expanding customer base and related growth in our technical infrastructure and expanded facilities. Non-cash items consisted primarily of $29.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $8.5 million in amortization of the Convertible Notes discount and related debt issuance costs, $8.4 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, a $2.1 million decrease in our deferred income taxes, and $0.6 million of other non-cash items.\nOur quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including commissions, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead.\nAs a result of our current net operating loss position, current income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state income taxes, deferred income tax expenses relating to the tax amortization of recently acquired goodwill, and the release of valuation allowance resulting in deferred tax benefits relating to acquired net deferred tax liabilities. We incurred minimal state income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $276.9 million and $168.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2026, if not utilized. We also held state tax credits of $1.2 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, federal alternative minimum tax credits of zero and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and federal R&D tax credits of $3.2 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The state tax credits will expire in 2026 if not utilized, the federal R&D tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in 2027, if not utilized, and the federal alternative minimum tax credits have an indefinite carryforward period.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n (1) Includes amortization of acquired technology of 1.9%, 1.9% and 2.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nWe analyze solution and other costs that may be capitalized to assess their recoverability and only capitalize costs that we anticipate being recoverable. The portion of capitalized costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred solution and other costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred solution and other costs, net of current portion.\nThe purchase price allocation for business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic\nSubscription Fee Revenues\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718),\" to provide clarity and reduce both diversity in practice and cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription fees are based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the number of End Users using the solutions and the number of bill-pay and certain other transactions those users conduct using our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. Subscription fees are billed monthly, quarterly, or annually and are recognized monthly over the term of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. The structure and terms of the arrangements for our newer lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are varied, but we generally sell these solutions on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. We begin recognizing subscription fees when the control of the service transfers to the customer, generally when the solution is implemented and made available to the customer. The timing of our implementations varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. We recognize any related implementation services revenues ratably over the initial customer agreement term beginning on the date we commence recognizing subscription fees. Contract asset balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Amounts that have been invoiced but not paid are recorded in accounts receivable or other long-term assets, depending on the timing of expected billing, and in revenues or deferred revenues, depending on when control of the service transfers to the customer.\n\nWe have achieved significant growth since our inception. During each of the past seven years, our average number of Registered Users per installed customer on our digital banking platform, or Installed Customer, has grown, and we have been able to sell additional solutions to existing customers. Our revenues per Installed Customer and per Registered User vary period-to-period based on the length and timing of customer implementations, changes in the average number of Registered Users per customer, sales of additional solutions to existing customers, changes in the number of transactions on our solutions by Registered Users and variations among existing customers and new customers with respect to the mix of purchased solutions and related pricing. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operation Measures\" for additional detail on how we define \"Installed Customers\" and \"Registered Users.\"\nWe value restricted stock units at the closing market price on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the restricted stock unit award.\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n (2) Includes stock-based compensation expenses as follows: \nRCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities and capture End User engagement by providing new, innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences. Traditional financial services providers such as banks and credit unions are experiencing reduced End User engagement in their physical branches and increased End User engagement with their digital services and thus they are increasing their investment in digital services. Emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs are leveraging their digital focus and expertise and capitalizing on increased End User demand for digital financial services by creating new and expanding existing digital service offerings. This combined investment by traditional and emerging financial services providers is driving further competition, segmentation and innovation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Total benefit from (provision for) income taxes increased by $0.7 million from a provision of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to a benefit of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from utilization of the R&D tax credits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we add personnel to support our revenue growth and as we increase discretionary marketing spend to attract new customers, retain and grow existing customers and drive brand awareness. We expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over time as our revenues grow.\nIncome Taxes\nOur payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe capitalize sales commissions and other third-party costs, such as third-party licenses and maintenance related to our customer agreements. We capitalize sales commissions because the commission charges are so closely related to the revenues from the non-cancellable customer agreements that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. Under the new revenue standard, we capitalize commissions and bonuses for those involved in the sale, including direct employees and indirect supervisors, as these are incremental to the sale. We typically pay commissions in two increments. The initial payment is made after the contract has been executed and the initial deposit has been received from the customer, and the final payment is made upon commencement date. We require that an individual remain employed to collect a commission when it is due. The service period between the first and second payment is considered to be a substantive service period, and as a result, we expense the final payment when made. We begin amortizing deferred solution and other costs for a particular customer agreement once the revenue recognition criteria are met and amortize those deferred costs over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Upon enactment, we did not have any foreign subsidiaries and the international aspects of the Tax Act were not applicable.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.8 million, or 21.0%, from $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $5.9 million increase in personnel costs to support the growth of our business including the addition of certain senior executives. The increase in personnel costs includes a $2.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to general and administrative expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price and $0.4 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. The remaining increase was attributable to a $0.7 million increase in professional services for legal and consulting fees, a $0.6 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs, a $0.4 million increase in travel and other discretionary expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in sales tax expense and other miscellaneous charges.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Total benefit from income taxes increased by $3.5 million from a benefit of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a benefit of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a reduction in the valuation allowance of $3.0 million due to the deferred tax liability for the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018 after purchase accounting adjustments. Additionally, $0.5 million of the increase is related to the increase in benefit from the state R&D tax credits and the deferred tax liability release from net operating loss and interest carryovers during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of accounting in the new revenue standard. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have contracts with customers that often include multiple performance obligations, usually including multiple subscription and implementation services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct by allocating the contract's total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the relative standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct good or service in the contract. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, we considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the customer's personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. We have concluded that the implementation services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations in the North American banking market are not distinct and, as a result, we defer any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognize such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue for the initial agreement term of the hosted application agreements. We have concluded that outside the North American banking market, the implementation services for our lending\nContract Balances\nWe capitalize certain personnel and other costs, such as employee salaries, benefits and the associated payroll taxes that are direct and incremental to the implementation of our solutions. We analyze implementation costs that may be capitalized to assess their recoverability, and only capitalize costs that we anticipate to be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our deferred implementation costs by comparing the greater of the amount of the non-cancellable portion of a customer's contract and the non-refundable customer prepayments received as it relates to the specific implementation costs incurred. We begin amortizing the deferred implementation costs for an implementation once the revenue recognition criteria have been met, and we amortize those deferred implementation costs ratably over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been\n805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\" as of January 1, 2017. Under ASU 2017-01, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is not a business. If it is not met, we determine whether the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, meets the definition of a business.\nWe capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solution to the extent those costs are considered to be recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for a particular implementation once revenue recognition commences, and we amortize those implementation costs over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\n \u2022 our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; \nKey Operating Measures\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nWe earn the majority of our transactional revenues based on the number of bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform. We also generate a smaller portion of our transactional revenues from interchange fees generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with our Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services and interchange fees in the month incurred based on actual transactions.\nWe define a Registered User as an individual related to an account holder of an Installed Customer on our digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. We price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of Registered Users, so as the number of Registered Users of our solutions increases, our revenues grow. Our average number of Registered Users per Installed Customer grows as our existing digital banking platform customers add more Registered Users and as we add larger RCFIs to our Installed Customer base. We anticipate that the number of Registered Users will grow at a faster rate than our number of Installed Customers. The rate at which our customers add Registered Users and the incremental revenues we recognize from new Registered Users vary significantly period-to-period based on the timing of our implementations of new customers and the timing of registration of new End Users. Our Installed Customers had approximately 12.8 million, 10.4 million and 8.6 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\nWe intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation and customer support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our customers and support our growth. We expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business but to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues based principally on the level and timing of implementation and support activities and other related costs.\nWe recognize usage revenue related to End Users accessing our solutions in excess of contracted amounts, bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform, and interchange fees that End Users generate using our solutions. Judgment is required to determine the accounting for these types of revenue. We consider various factors including the degree to which usage is interdependent or interrelated to past services, costs to us per End User over the contract, contractual price per End User changes and their relationship to market terms, forecasted data, and our cost to fulfill the obligation. We have concluded that our usage revenue relates specifically to the transfer of the service to the customer and is consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606 when considering all of the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract. Therefore, we recognize usage revenue on a monthly or quarterly basis in accordance with the agreement, as determined and reported. This allocation reflects the amount we expect to receive for the services for the given period.\nPurchase Price Allocation, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and \nRegistered Users\nour implementation activities to help ensure a successful roll-out of the solutions to End Users and increase the registration of new End Users. Unusually long or short implementations, for even a small number of customers, may result in short-term quarterly variability in our results of operations.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nProfessional services revenues, which primarily consist of training, advisory services, core conversion services, web design, and other general professional services, are generally billed and recognized when delivered. Certain out-of-pocket expenses billed to customers are recorded as revenues rather than an offset to the related expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $7.0 million, or 16.9%, from $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $5.5 million increase in personnel costs due to the growth of our sales and marketing organizations. The increase in personnel costs includes a $2.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to sales and marketing for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price and $1.0 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, there was a a $0.6 million increase in travel related expenses due to increased employee travel to attract new customers and support our sales and marketing initiatives, $0.5 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our sales and marketing departments, and a $0.4 million increase in discretionary marketing spend as a result of efforts to drive brand awareness and expanded marketing efforts to attract new customers and retain and grow existing customers.\n \u2022 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; \nWe are a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which traditional and emerging financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We sell our solutions to regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs, alternative finance and leasing companies, or Alt-FIs, and financial technology companies, or FinTechs. Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust suites of digital banking, lending, leasing, and banking as a service, or BaaS, services that make it possible for End Users to transact and engage anytime, anywhere and on any device. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As such, we purpose-build our solutions to deliver compelling and consistent End User experiences across digital channels and to drive the success of our customers by optimizing their digital brands and enhancing End User acquisition, retention and engagement.\nThe effective delivery and management of secure and advanced digital solutions in the complex and heavily-regulated financial services industry requires significant resources, personnel and expertise. We provide digital solutions that are designed to be highly configurable, scalable and adaptable to the specific needs of our customers. We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are also designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers and their End Users.\nAcquisition related costs include compensation expenses related to milestone provisions and retention agreements with certain former shareholders and employees of acquired businesses which are recognized as earned, and various legal and professional service expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions, which were recognized when incurred.\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments; \nDeferred Revenues\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of significant judgments and estimates by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $171.3 million, consisting primarily of $130.7 million for the acquisitions of Cloud Lending and Gro and release of the hold back from the asset acquisition in 2017, $75.7 million for the purchase of investments, and $13.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment. These outflows were partially offset by $48.4 million received from the maturities of investments.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles increased by $0.4 million, or 24.5%, from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included the amortization of acquired intangible assets purchased in the fourth quarter of 2018 from Cloud Lending and Gro, as well as acquired intangible asset amortization related to our business combinations in 2015 and asset purchase in 2017. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised of acquired intangible asset amortization related to our business combinations in 2015 and asset purchase in 2017. These amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nCertain research and development costs that are related to our software development, which include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions, are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense.\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of investments in growing our business. The timing of our implementation activities and corresponding revenues from new customers are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our sales. Sales may tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in subsequent quarters but any resulting impact on our results of operation has been difficult to measure due to the timing of our implementations and overall growth in our business. The timing of our implementations also varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As a result, we and our customers are very deliberate and careful in\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our professional sales organization. While the RCFI market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, the Alt-FI and FinTech markets are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. We intend to add sales representatives to identify and address the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets across the U.S. and internationally. We also expect to increase our number of sales support and marketing personnel, as well as our investment in marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our solutions and generate new customer opportunities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nResults of Operations\nOur recent financing activities have consisted primarily of our February 2018 Convertible Note financing, net proceeds from exercises of options to purchase our common stock, as well as payments on financing obligations and payments on capital lease obligations.\nWe sometimes provide credits or incentives to our customers. Known and estimable credits and incentives represent a form of variable consideration, which are estimated at contract inception and reduce the revenues recognized for a particular contract. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration as of December 31, 2018.\nprimarily of $20.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $14.9 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and $7.5 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\" which provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. We adopted this ASU retrospectively, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we included restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows, resulting in an increase in net cash of $1.8 million for fiscal 2018 and $2.3 million for fiscal 2017.", "item_7_text": "For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in investing activities was $16.9 million, consisting primarily of $27.7 million for the purchase of investments, $12.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, $3.8 million for an asset purchase and release of the hold back from the Social Money acquisition, and a $1.0 million in capitalized software development costs. These outflows were partially offset by $27.9 million received from the maturities of investments.\nadministrative expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. The remaining increase was attributable to a $0.7 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs. This increase was partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in professional services for legal and consulting fees and a $0.8 million decrease in sales tax expense and other miscellaneous charges.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Acquisition related costs increased by $2.9 million, or 236.4%, from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $4.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included $3.1 million of legal, professional services and other costs related to the 2018 acquisitions of Cloud Lending and Gro, $0.6 million of compensation expense related to the remaining retention bonuses for employees of companies acquired in 2015, and $0.3 million of compensation expense related to Cloud Lending and Gro. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised solely of compensation expense related to the employees of companies acquired in 2015. The final retention bonuses related to the companies acquired in 2015 were paid out in the third quarter of 2018.\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables (contract assets), and deferred revenues (contract liabilities). Billings scheduled to occur after the performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue recognition has occurred result in contract assets. Contract assets that are expected to be billed during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded in contract assets, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded in contract assets, net of current portion on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period. A contract liability results when we receive prepayments or deposits from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed. We recognize contract liabilities as revenues when the services are performed, and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Contract liabilities that are expected to be recognized as revenues during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded in deferred revenues, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded in deferred revenue, net of current portion, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period.\nOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments, our recent acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment to support our growth, and costs incurred for the development of capitalized software. Purchases of property and equipment may vary period-to-period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations, data center and other technical infrastructure.\nCash Flows\n842, which among other things, will allow us to carry forward the historical lease classification and the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components of an agreement. We expect the adoption of Topic 842 to result in the recording of additional net lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $26 million to $28 million and approximately $35 million to $37 million, respectively, as of January 1, 2019. The difference between the additional lease assets and lease liabilities is the reclassification of deferred rent on our balance sheet at the date of adoption. We do not expect the standard to impact the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss or the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nwhich included a $1.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. In addition, there was a $4.5 million increase in co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets resulting from the increased infrastructure necessary to support our expanding customer base, a $4.1 million increase in direct costs related to bill-pay transaction processing and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions which was related to the increase in the number of new Registered Users and transactions processed on our digital banking platform and increases in implementation and support expenses that are reimbursable from our customers, a $2.0 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our implementation and support departments, a $1.4 million increase from capitalized services amortization, and a $0.4 million increase in amortization of acquired customer technology. These increases were partially offset by a $0.4 million decrease in travel and other discretionary expenses.\nRevenues\nInstalled Customers\nWe estimate the fair value of market stock units on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of fair value of the market stock units is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatility and the risk-free interest rate. Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and peer firms' stocks and the Index over the performance period. We assumed no dividend yield and recognize compensation expense using the graded attribution method on a straight-line basis over the performance period of the market stock unit award.\nWe believe that continuing to improve and enhance our solutions is essential to maintaining our reputation for innovation and growing our customer base and revenues. Research and development expenses include salaries and personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, software development costs, allocated overhead and other related expenses incurred in developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions. Research and development expenses are expensed as incurred.\nWe capitalize certain software development costs related to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions. The costs related to software development that are incurred between reaching technological feasibility of a solution and the point at which the solution is ready for general release are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2017, all of the products related to capitalized software development costs reached general release, and we have commenced amortization of these costs. Capitalized software development costs are computed on an individual product basis and products available for market are amortized to cost of revenues over the products' estimated economic lives.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We record deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences. We recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized, and we recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction. To date, we have provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as we believe the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of our forecasted future results. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment. We will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence and will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available.\nOur principal commitments consist of the Convertible Notes, non-cancelable operating leases related to our facilities, minimum purchase commitments for third-party products, co-location fees and other product costs. In February 2018, we issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.75% Convertible Notes due February 15, 2023, unless earlier converted or repurchased in accordance with their terms. Interest on the Convertible Notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. We are also party to several purchase commitments for third-party products that contain both a contractual minimum obligation and a variable obligation based upon usage or other factors which can change on a monthly basis. The estimated amounts for usage and other factors are not included within the table below.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities is primarily influenced by the amount and timing of customer receipts and vendor payments and by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business and increase in the number of installed customers.\nCertain former stockholders of Cloud Lending have the right to receive an earnout payment based upon satisfaction of certain financial milestones. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration related to the potential earnout payment is calculated utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation method under the the option pricing model, and this amount is recorded in other long-term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of this contingent consideration is estimated on a quarterly basis through a collaborative effort by our sales and finance departments. Changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration subsequent to the purchase price finalization will be recorded as acquisition related costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nComponents of Operating Results\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was $11.6 million, consisting solely of cash received from the exercise of stock options.\nand leasing platform included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct and, as a result, we recognize implementation fees on such arrangements as the related implementation services are performed.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nA small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Term licenses sold with maintenance entitle the customer to technical support, upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis. Under the new revenue standard, we recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which generally occurs at the start of each license term. We recognize the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license. If the expected length of time between when we transfer the software license to the customer and when the customer pays for it results in a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money, which reflects the price the customer would have paid when the license was transferred. Revenues from term licenses and maintenance agreements and the related financing component were not significant in the periods presented.\nWe began by providing digital banking solutions to domestic RCFIs with the mission of empowering them to leverage technology to compete more effectively and to strengthen the communities and End Users they serve. To date, a substantial majority of our revenues continue to come from sales of our digital banking platform to RCFIs, and we continue to be focused on our founding mission of building stronger communities by strengthening their financial institutions. However, the continued proliferation and ubiquity of mobile and tablet devices and End Users' increasing expectations for digital services have driven increases in the number of providers, greater fragmentation of financial services markets and a broadening set of new and innovative digital services, creating challenges and opportunities in the markets served by RCFIs as well as emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs. End Users increasingly expect to transact and engage with financial services providers anytime, anywhere and on any device, and seamlessly across devices. End Users also select digital solutions based on the quality and intuitiveness of the digital user experience.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Revenues increased by $43.8 million, or 29.1%, from $150.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $38.9 million increase from the growth in new Registered Users from a combination of strong customer retention, the purchase of additional solutions by existing customers and the addition of Registered Users from new Installed Customers. The remaining $4.9 million increase was generated from increases in the number of transactions processed using our solutions. The number of Registered Users on our digital banking platform increased from 8.6 million at December 31, 2016 to 10.4 million at December 31, 2017.\nRevenue-generating activities are directly related to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or cloud-based hosting services, transaction revenue from bill-pay solutions, as well as revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions. We recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. We account for revenue in accordance with the new revenue standard, ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which was adopted on January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will change in any given period based on several factors including the addition of newly-hired sales professionals, the number and timing of newly-installed customers and the amount of sales commissions expense amortized related to those customers. Commissions are generally capitalized and then amortized over the expected period of customer benefit.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Total other income (expense), net increased by $0.6 million from expense of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 consisted of a decrease of $0.4 million of interest expense from the expiration of our previously existing credit facility in 2017 and an increase of $0.2 million of interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\n\n\nOverview\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses increased by $7.9 million, or 24.3%, from $32.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $4.9 million increase in personnel costs as a result of the growth in our research and development organization for continued enhancements to our solutions, which includes a $1.5 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. An additional $1.7 million of the increase resulted from the reduction of capitalization of research and development salaries as software development costs during 2017 because all products previously being capitalized reached general release during 2017 and a $1.5 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs. These increases were partially offset by a $0.2 million decrease in travel and other discretionary expenses.\nWe evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis) with respect to the vendor reseller agreements pursuant to which we resell certain third-party solutions along with our solutions. Generally, we report revenues from these types of contracts on a gross basis, meaning the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenues, and expenses incurred are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we first obtain control of the inputs to the specific good or service and direct their use to create the combined output. Our control is evidenced by our involvement in the integration of the good or service on our solutions before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Revenues provided from agreements in which we are an agent are immaterial.\nWe believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party systems allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings across the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of RCFIs, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us in the market for digital financial services solutions. We intend to increase investments in technology innovation and software development as we enhance our solutions and platforms and increase or expand the number of solutions that we offer.\nDeferred Solution and Other Costs\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in October, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Because we operate in a single reporting unit, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level by comparing the estimated fair value of the company to the carrying value of the company. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a \"step one\" analysis using a fair-value-based approach based on the market capitalization or a discounted cash flow analysis of projected future results to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Determining the fair value of goodwill is subjective in nature and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions including, without limitation, use of estimates of future prices and volumes for our products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast. If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur impairment charges in a future period. The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2018. No impairment of goodwill was identified during 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $9.5 million, which consisted of non-cash adjustments of $43.4 million, offset by a net loss of $26.2 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.7 million. Cash outflows are the result of a $10.5 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $4.4 million decrease in accrued liabilities mainly from the payment of milestone and retention bonuses related to the companies acquired in 2015, a $1.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, a $0.2 million increase in other long-term assets, and a $0.1 million decrease in deferred rents and other long-term liabilities. Cash inflows were the result of a $4.8 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, a $3.4 million increase in accounts payable due to timing of payments in support of our expanding customer base and related growth in our technical infrastructure and expanded facilities, and a $0.2 million decrease in other prepaid assets. Non-cash items consisted\nSales and marketing expenses are also impacted by the timing of significant marketing programs such as our annual user conference which we typically hold during the second quarter. We plan to continue investing in sales and marketing by increasing our number of sales and marketing personnel and expanding our sales and marketing activities. We believe these investments will help us build brand awareness, add new customers and expand sales to our existing customers as they continue to buy more solutions from us, the number of End Users utilizing our solutions grows and those End Users increase the number of transactions they perform on our solutions.\nCost of Revenues\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement, generally when our solutions are implemented and made available to our customers. The promised consideration may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. Revenues are recognized net of sales credits and allowances.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The primary method used to estimate SSP is the adjusted market assessment approach, which considers its overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, its discounting practices, the size and volume of its transactions, customer characteristics, price lists, go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and agreement prices, and the number and types of End Users within its contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $3.4 million, which consisted of a net loss of $36.4 million, offset by cash inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $7.1 million and non-cash adjustments of $32.7 million. Cash inflows were the result of a $11.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities as a result of increased spending in support of our expanding customer base, related growth in our technical infrastructure and our expanding operations, a $9.6 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, and a $3.0 million increase in deferred rents and other accrued liabilities as a result of the tenant improvement allowances for our new facilities. Cash outflows are the result of a $13.2 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $3.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, and a $0.2 million increase in other prepaid assets. Non-cash items consisted primarily of $12.6 million of stock-based compensation expense, $12.2 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $6.8 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, and $1.1 million of other non-cash items.\nThe majority of our revenue recognized at a particular point in time is for professional services and usage revenue. These services are performed within a relatively short period of time and are recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon completion of the service.\nDeferred revenues primarily consist of amounts that have been billed to or received from customers in advance of revenue recognition and prepayments received from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. We recognize deferred revenues as revenues when the services are performed and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nA substantial majority of our software solutions are available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing perpetual rights to the software. Subscription fees from these applications, including contractual periodic price increases, are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term beginning on the date our solution is made available to the customer. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenues or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Periodic price increases are estimated at contract inception and result in contract assets as revenue recognition may exceed the amount billed early in the contract. Additional fees for monthly usage above the levels included in the standard subscription fee are recognized as revenue in the month when the usage amounts are determined and reported.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was $0.9 million, consisting primarily of $6.0 million from the exercise of stock options, which was partially offset by $4.9 million of payments on financing obligations and $0.2 million of payments on capital lease obligations.\nWe value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected stock price volatility, and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected life represents the period of time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and end of the contractual term. We use the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Due to our limited history as a public company, expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends. We recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the stock option award.\nOperating Expenses\n (3) Unoccupied lease charges in 2018 include costs related to the early exit from of a portion of our south Austin facility, and in 2016 include the early exit from our previous Lincoln, Nebraska facility, partially offset by sublease income from those facilities.  Due to rounding, totals may not equal the sum of the line items in the tables above.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\n (3) Unoccupied lease charges in 2018 include costs related to the early exit from of a portion of our south Austin facility, and in 2016 include the early exit from our previous Lincoln, Nebraska facility, partially offset by sublease income from those facilities.  The following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of revenues for each of the periods indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K, such as the use of unconsolidated subsidiaries, structured finance, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nAmortization of acquired intangibles represent the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our business acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our products and services over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our revenue retention rate as the total revenues in a calendar year, excluding any revenues from solutions of businesses acquired during such year, from customers who were implemented on any of our solutions as of December 31 of the prior year, expressed as a percentage of the total revenues during the prior year from the same group of customers. Our revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year revenues of: the number of new customers implemented on any of our solutions during the prior year; the timing of our implementation of those new customers in the prior year; growth in the number of End Users on such solutions and changes in their usage of such solutions; sales of new products and services to our existing customers during the current year, excluding any products or services resulting from businesses acquired during such year; and customer attrition. The most significant drivers of changes in our revenue retention rate each year have historically been the number of new customers in the prior year and the timing of our implementation of those new customers. The timing of our implementation of new customers in the prior year is significant because we do not start recognizing revenues from new customers until they are implemented. If implementations are weighted more heavily in the first or second half of the prior year, our revenue retention rate will be lower or higher, respectively. Our use of revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate revenue retention rate differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our revenue retention rate was 114%, 122%, and 122% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued ASU No. 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled to when products are transferred to customers. ASU 2014-09 was modified by subsequently issued ASUs 2015-14, 2016-08, 2016-10, 2016-12 and 2016-20. Topic 606 also includes Subtopic 340-40, Other Assets and Deferred Costs - Contracts with Customers, which requires the deferral of incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. Collectively, we refer to ASU 2014-09, as amended, and Subtopic 340-40 as the \"new revenue standard.\" On January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue standard for all contracts which were not completed as of January 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective method. Adoption of the new revenue standard resulted in changes to our accounting policies for revenue recognition, contract balances, accounts receivable, deferred revenues, deferred implementation costs, and deferred solution and other costs. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the new revenue standard as a positive adjustment to the opening balance of accumulated deficit on the consolidated balance sheet in the amount of $15.8 million, which reflects the acceleration of revenues and deferral of incremental commission costs of obtaining subscription contracts. The comparative information in prior periods presented has not been restated and continues to be reported under the accounting standards in effect for those periods. See Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for the impact of this adoption.\ndetermined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology.\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nStock-Based Compensation\nAcquisition Related Costs\nIn December 2017, the SEC issued SAB 118 to address the application of GAAP in situations in which a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-05, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SEC Update),\" which amended ASC 740 to incorporate the requirements of SAB 118. Disclosures related to the effect of the Tax Act and our utilization of SAB 118 appear in Note 14 - Income Taxes.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include costs to comply with regulations governing public companies, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, investor relations activities, and costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to incur both increased external audit fees as well as additional spending to ensure continued regulatory and Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance. We expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over time as our revenues grow.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Acquisition related costs decreased by $5.1 million, or 80.5%, from $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, to $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised of compensation expense related to the remaining retention bonuses for employees of the companies acquired in 2015, while the expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $4.4 million of compensation expense related to the milestone provisions for certain former Centrix shareholders, $1.7 million related to retention bonuses for employees of the companies acquired in 2015, and $0.2 million of legal and other expenses incurred related to the acquisitions. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid out $6.0 million to former Centrix shareholders, based upon the achievement of certain milestone-based objectives and $1.4 million in retention bonuses based upon continued employment.\nWe have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005. In addition, over the past three years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functions that serve a broader range of needs of RCFIs as well as the needs of Alt-FIs and FinTechs. In addition to our acquisitions of Centrix and Social Money in 2015, on October 15, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Cloud Lending, Inc., or Cloud Lending, a provider of an end-to-end digital lending and leasing platform and on November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of Gro Solutions, Inc., or Gro, a provider of digital account opening and digital sales and marketing solutions for financial institutions. Our solutions now include a broad range of services and experiences including corporate banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending and leasing, BaaS and digital account opening and sales and marketing solutions both in the U.S. and internationally.\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired; \nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, \"Intangibles-Goodwill and Other-Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40),\" which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use software license). ASU 2018-15 will be effective beginning in our first quarter of 2020, with early adoption permitted. The ASU may be applied retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. We are anticipating early adoption of the ASU for January 1, 2019 and are currently evaluating the financial statement impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of this adoption.\nWhile we anticipate that revenue growth from transactions processed by our solutions will increase in absolute dollars, we expect the year over year growth rate to be lower than in recent periods.\n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.  Because of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA together with our GAAP financial measures including cash flow from operations and net loss. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Research and development expenses increased by $11.0 million, or 27.3%, from $40.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $51.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $8.5 million increase in personnel costs as a result of the growth in our research and development organization for continued enhancements to our solutions, which includes a $2.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to research and development expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price and $0.9 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. An additional $1.0 million of the increase resulted from the reduction of capitalization of research and development salaries as software development costs during 2018 because all products previously being capitalized reached general release during 2017, a $0.7 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs, and a $0.7 million increase in travel and other discretionary expenses.\n \u2022 our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our overall operating performance.  Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther Considerations\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, certain costs related to our recent acquisitions, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, total other (income) expense, net, and unoccupied lease charges. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal and human resources employees. General and administrative expenses also include consulting and professional fees, insurance and travel. We expect to continue to incur incremental expenses associated with the growth of our business and to meet increased compliance requirements associated with operating as a public company. These expenses include costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations governing public companies, increased costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance and investor relations activities.\nImplementation services are required for each new digital banking and lending and leasing platform and Centrix standalone contract, and there is a significant level of integration and configuration for each customer. Our revenue for upfront implementation services are billed upfront and recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term for our hosted application agreements. Upfront implementation services for on-premises agreements are recognized at commencement date. Under certain circumstances, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support the installation and configuration process for our digital lending and leasing solutions, and therefore, we have determined that these services qualify as a separate performance obligation in certain markets and geographies, and the upfront implementation services for these agreements are recognized at commencement date.\nWe maintain a reserve for estimated sales credits issued to customers for billing disputes or other service-related reasons. This allowance is recorded as a reduction against current period revenues and accounts receivable. In estimating this allowance, we analyze prior periods to determine the amounts of sales credits issued to customers compared to the revenues in the period that related to the original customer invoice. This estimate is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary.\n\nWe defer certain payroll costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are considered to be recoverable from future revenues. However, a substantial portion of our implementation costs are not eligible for deferral and, as a result, are expensed in the period incurred. Costs related to implementations that have been deferred are amortized over the expected period of customer benefit. Additionally, we invest in personnel, business processes and systems infrastructure to standardize our business processes and drive future efficiency in our implementations, customer support and data center operations. We expect these investments will increase cost of revenues in absolute dollars as we continue to make investments in capacity and process improvement.\nWe assess the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable deemed uncollectable. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, we did not provide for an allowance for doubtful accounts, as all amounts outstanding were deemed collectable. Historically, our collection experience has not varied significantly, and bad debt expenses have been insignificant.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Revenues increased by $47.1 million, or 24.3%, from $194.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $241.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $36.5 million increase from the sale of additional solutions to new and existing customers and the growth in Registered Users from new and existing customers. In addition, $8.5 million of the increase was generated from increases in the number of transactions processed using our solutions, and $2.1 million of the increase was generated from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. The number of Registered Users on our online banking platform increased from 10.4 million at December 31, 2017 to 12.8 million at December 31, 2018. The increases for the year ended December 31, 2018 also included $7.7 million related to the adjustments from the new revenue standard.\nChurn\nidentical services at a lower price. Our annual churn has ranged from 5.1% to 3.5% over the last seven years, and we had annual churn of 5.0%, 4.9% and 5.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our use of churn has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate churn differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nRevenue-generating activities directly relate to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the substantial majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in our data centers or with our cloud-based hosting resources as well as revenues for implementation and customer support services related to our solutions, and we recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host our solutions in their own data centers under term license and maintenance agreements, and we recognize the software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license and corresponding maintenance revenues over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license.\n (1) Includes amortization of acquired technology of $4.5 million, $3.6 million and $3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to support and expand our platform and enhance our existing solutions.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses increased by $5.2 million, or 16.3%, from $32.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $6.5 million increase in personnel costs to support the growth of our business including the addition of certain senior executives. The increase in personnel costs includes a $4.1 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to general and\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash used in investing activities was $16.5 million, consisting primarily of $40.2 million for the purchase of investments, $14.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment, $2.7 million in capitalized software development costs and $0.3 million from the purchase of other intangible assets. These outflows were partially offset by $41.1 million received from the maturities of investments.\nRevenue Recognition\nSales and Marketing\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Amortization of acquired intangibles was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The acquired intangible assets are related to our business combinations in 2015 and asset purchase in 2017, and these amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nThe portion of deferred implementation costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred implementation costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred implementation costs, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheet.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nServices and Other Revenues\nWe deliver our solutions to the substantial majority of our customers using a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host our solutions in their own data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Our digital banking platform customers have numerous End Users, and those End Users can represent one or more Registered Users on our solutions. We generally price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers and the number of Registered Users utilizing our solutions. We generally earn additional revenues from our digital banking platform customers based on the number of transactions that Registered Users perform on our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. As a result, our revenues from digital banking platform customers grow as\nSources of Liquidity\nTotal other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income and expense and loss on disposal of long-lived assets. We earn interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our convertible notes issued in February 2018, or Convertible Notes, fees and interest associated with the letter of credit issued to our landlord for the security deposit for our corporate headquarters, and the interest incurred on our previously existing credit facility which expired in April 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Total other income (expense), net decreased by $7.8 million from income of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an expense of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a $10.0 million increase in interest expense from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our Convertible Notes issued in February 2018, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in interest income earned on cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nOperating Expenses\n\nUnoccupied lease charges include costs related to the early exit from a portion of our south Austin facility, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from that facility.\nUnoccupied Lease Charges\nWe believe that delivery of consistent, high-quality customer support is a significant driver of purchasing and renewal decisions of our prospects and customers. To develop and maintain a reputation for high-quality service, we seek to build deep relationships with our customers through our customer service organization, which we staff with personnel who are motivated by our common mission of using technology to help our customers succeed and who are knowledgeable with respect to the regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry. As we grow our business, we must continue to invest in and grow our services organization to support our customers' needs and maintain our reputation.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments,\" to clarify and provide specific guidance on eight cash flow classification issues that are not addressed by current GAAP and thereby reduce the current diversity in practice. We adopted ASU 2016-15, effective January 1, 2018, and there was no impact on the consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nIf we are successful in growing our revenues by increasing the number and scope of our customer relationships, we anticipate that greater economies of scale and increased operating leverage will improve our margins over the long term. We also anticipate that increases in the number of Registered Users for existing digital banking platform customers will improve our margins. However, we do not have any control or influence over whether End Users of our digital banking platform elect to become Registered Users of our customers' digital banking services.\nIn February 2018, we issued $230.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in February 2023, or the Convertible Notes. In accounting for the issuance of the Convertible Notes, we separated each of the Convertible Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value, as of the date of issuance, of a similar debt without the conversion option. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion option was determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the total initial proceeds. The difference between the par amount of the Convertible Notes and the carrying amount of the liability component represents debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to the Convertible Notes, we allocated the total amount of issuance costs incurred to liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the Convertible Notes using the effective interest rate method. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in additional paid-in capital.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, \"Leases (Topic 842),\" to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-10, \"Codification Improvements to Topic 842 (Leases),\" which provides narrow amendments to clarify how to apply certain aspects of the new lease standard. In July 2018, the FASB also issued ASU 2018-11, \"Targeted Improvements,\" which provides the option to adopt ASU No. 2016-02 retrospectively for each prior period presented or as of the adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. These standards are effective for public entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, and early application is permitted. We anticipate that the adoption of Topic 842 will impact our consolidated balance sheets as most of our operating lease commitments will be subject to the new standard and recognized as right-of-use assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities upon the adoption of Topic 842, which will increase the total assets and total liabilities that we report relative to such amounts prior to adoption. We intend to adopt the standard using the adoption method outlined in ASU 2018-11, which allows entities to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We intend to elect the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within Topic\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $4.9 million, or 13.5%, from $36.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $3.7 million increase in personnel costs due to the growth of our sales and marketing organizations. The increase in personnel costs includes a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to sales and marketing for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. In addition, there was a $0.5 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our sales and marketing departments, a $0.4 million increase in discretionary marketing spend as a result of efforts to drive brand awareness and expanded marketing efforts to attract new customers and retain and grow existing customers and a $0.3 million increase in travel related expenses due to increased employee travel to attract new customers and efforts to support our sales and marketing initiatives.\nStock options, restricted stock units, and market stock units awarded to employees, directors, executives and consultants are measured at fair value at each grant date. As of January 1, 2017, we no longer use a forfeiture rate to recognize compensation expense as a result of the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, \"Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.\" Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting monthly over the following 36 months, and restricted stock unit awards vest in four annual installments of 25% each. Market stock units are performance-based awards that cliff vest based on our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index, or Index, over a three-year period on the anniversary of the date of grant. Up to one-third of the target shares of our common stock subject to each market stock unit award are eligible to be earned after the first and second years of the performance period and up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each market stock unit award are eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period (less any shares earned for years one and two) based on the average price of our common stock relative to the Index during the performance period.\n\nWe have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our IPO, follow-on offerings, cash flows from operations and our February 2018 Convertible Note financing. At December 31, 2018, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and investments of $177.3 million.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,\" which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by removing Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test and requires an entity to write down the carrying value of goodwill up to the amount by which the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years and early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nSoftware development costs include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions. The costs related to software development that are incurred between reaching technological feasibility of a solution and the point at which the solution is ready for general release are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet. Capitalized software development costs are computed on an individual product basis, and products available for market are amortized to cost of revenues over the products' estimated economic lives.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by financing activities was $216.6 million, which was primarily due to the issuance of $223.2 million principal amount of the Convertible Notes, net of issuance costs, and the related sale of Warrants for $22.4 million, offset by the purchase of bond hedges for $41.7 million. In addition, cash flows from financing activities included $12.7 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options.\nWe utilize churn to monitor the satisfaction of our customers and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. We define churn as the amount of any monthly recurring revenue losses due to customer cancellations and downgrades, net of upgrades and additions of new solutions, during a year, divided by our monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the year. Cancellations refer to customers that have either stopped using our services completely or remained a customer but terminated a particular service. Downgrades are a result of customers taking less of a particular service or renewing their contract for\nWe define Installed Customers as the number of customers on our digital banking platform from which we are currently recognizing revenues. The average size of our Installed Customers, measured in both Registered Users per Installed Customer and revenues per Installed Customer, has increased over time as our existing Installed Customers continue to add Registered Users and buy more solutions from us, and as we add larger RCFIs to our Installed Customer base. The net rate at which we add Installed Customers varies based on our implementation capacity, the size and unique needs of our customers, the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions, and customer attrition, including as a result of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions. We had 401, 382 and 385 Installed Customers on our digital banking platform as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Cost of revenues increased by $22.1 million, or 28.5%, from $77.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily attributable to a $10.1 million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure,\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nTransactional Revenues\nSales and Marketing\n\nIn addition to the United States generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measures described below in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results,\" we monitor the following operating measures to evaluate growth trends, plan investments and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts:\nThe following table presents our cost of revenues for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our business, and we intend to invest across our organization to increase our revenues and improve our operating efficiencies. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute dollar basis, but the timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we expect to add new customers, the implementation and support needs of our customers, our software development plans, our technology infrastructure requirements and the internal needs of our organization. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our realizing any resultant benefit which may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources.\nResearch and Development\n (2) Includes stock-based compensation expenses as follows (in thousands): \nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments at December 31, 2018 (in thousands):\nThe following tables present our operating expenses for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue Retention Rate\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. They also include costs related to our acquisitions and the resulting amortization of acquired intangible assets from those acquisitions. We intend to continue to hire new employees and make other investments to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we grow our business.\nour customers buy more solutions from us and increase the number of Registered Users utilizing our solutions and as those users increase their number of transactions on our solutions. The structure and terms of the arrangements for our newer lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are varied, but we generally sell these solutions on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements.\n\nVariable Consideration\nCost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers. This includes the costs of our implementation, customer support, data center and customer training personnel, as well as costs related to research and development personnel who perform implementation and customer support services. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, the amortization of deferred solution and services costs, co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets, cloud-based hosting services, an allocation of general overhead costs, the amortization of acquired technology, and referral fees. We allocate general overhead expenses to all departments based on the number of employees in each department, which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Cost of revenues increased by $22.4 million, or 22.5%, from $99.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $121.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $11.7 million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure, which included $1.1 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018 and a $1.0 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to cost of revenue for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price. In addition, there was a $4.1 million increase in direct costs related to bill-pay transaction processing and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions which was related to the increase in the number of new Registered Users and transactions processed on our digital banking platform and increases in implementation and support expenses that are reimbursable from our customers, a $3.0 million increase in co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets resulting from the increased infrastructure necessary to support our expanding customer base, a $1.3 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our implementation and support departments, a $0.8 million increase in amortization of acquired customer technology from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018, a $0.8 million increase in travel and other discretionary expenses and a $0.6 million increase from capitalized services amortization.\nIn connection with our acquisitions and asset purchase discussed in Note 3 - Business Combinations and Asset Acquisition, we recorded certain intangible assets, including acquired technology, customer relationships, trademarks, non-compete agreements and assembled workforce. Amounts allocated to the acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. We periodically review the estimated useful lives and fair values of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances which might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life.\nAccounts receivable are stated at net realizable value, including both billed and unbilled receivables to customers. Unbilled receivable balances included in accounts receivable arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Generally, billing for revenues related to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are included in our minimum subscription fee occurs in the month the revenue is recognized, resulting in accounts receivable. Billing for revenues relating to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are in excess of our minimum subscription fees are, generally, billed in the month following the month the revenues were earned, resulting in an unbilled receivable.\n\nResearch and Development \n\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation; \nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nIn connection with the initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Act, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. The remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was primarily offset by application of our valuation allowance. We applied the guidance in Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, 118 when accounting for the enactment-date effects of the Act in 2017 and throughout 2018, recording provisional amount of $0.2 million related to the remeasurement of the deferred tax balances in the fourth quarter of 2017. During 2018, we completed our 2017 income tax returns and our accounting for the enactment-date income tax effects of the Act with no adjustments to the provisional amount recorded at December 31, 2017.\nRevenues\nContingent Consideration\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities were $4.6 million, which consisted of non-cash adjustments of $61.8 million, offset by a net loss of $35.4 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $21.8 million. Cash outflows are the result of a $15.8 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period, a $5.8 million increase in contract assets due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, a $4.7 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of billings at the end of the current year, a $1.4 million increase in other long-term assets from the addition of deferred tax assets, and a $1.1 million decrease in deferred rents and other long-term liabilities. Cash inflows were the result of a $4.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments, a $1.8 million decrease in other prepaid assets, and a $0.7 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments in support of our expanding customer base and related growth in our technical infrastructure and expanded facilities. Non-cash items consisted primarily of $29.5 million of stock-based compensation expense, $16.8 million of depreciation and amortization expense, $8.5 million in amortization of the Convertible Notes discount and related debt issuance costs, $8.4 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, a $2.1 million decrease in our deferred income taxes, and $0.6 million of other non-cash items.\nOur quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future, and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including commissions, benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead.\nAs a result of our current net operating loss position, current income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state income taxes, deferred income tax expenses relating to the tax amortization of recently acquired goodwill, and the release of valuation allowance resulting in deferred tax benefits relating to acquired net deferred tax liabilities. We incurred minimal state income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $276.9 million and $168.1 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, which will expire at various dates beginning in 2026, if not utilized. We also held state tax credits of $1.2 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, federal alternative minimum tax credits of zero and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and federal R&D tax credits of $3.2 million and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The state tax credits will expire in 2026 if not utilized, the federal R&D tax credits will expire at various dates beginning in 2027, if not utilized, and the federal alternative minimum tax credits have an indefinite carryforward period.\nSoftware Development Costs\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n (1) Includes amortization of acquired technology of 1.9%, 1.9% and 2.1% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \nWe analyze solution and other costs that may be capitalized to assess their recoverability and only capitalize costs that we anticipate being recoverable. The portion of capitalized costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred solution and other costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred solution and other costs, net of current portion.\nThe purchase price allocation for business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. We early adopted ASU No. 2017-01, \"Business Combinations (Topic\nSubscription Fee Revenues\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718),\" to provide clarity and reduce both diversity in practice and cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. We adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018, and there was no material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the adoption.\nCost of Revenues\nSubscription fees are based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the number of End Users using the solutions and the number of bill-pay and certain other transactions those users conduct using our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. Subscription fees are billed monthly, quarterly, or annually and are recognized monthly over the term of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. The structure and terms of the arrangements for our newer lending and leasing and BaaS solutions are varied, but we generally sell these solutions on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. We begin recognizing subscription fees when the control of the service transfers to the customer, generally when the solution is implemented and made available to the customer. The timing of our implementations varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. We recognize any related implementation services revenues ratably over the initial customer agreement term beginning on the date we commence recognizing subscription fees. Contract asset balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Amounts that have been invoiced but not paid are recorded in accounts receivable or other long-term assets, depending on the timing of expected billing, and in revenues or deferred revenues, depending on when control of the service transfers to the customer.\n\nWe have achieved significant growth since our inception. During each of the past seven years, our average number of Registered Users per installed customer on our digital banking platform, or Installed Customer, has grown, and we have been able to sell additional solutions to existing customers. Our revenues per Installed Customer and per Registered User vary period-to-period based on the length and timing of customer implementations, changes in the average number of Registered Users per customer, sales of additional solutions to existing customers, changes in the number of transactions on our solutions by Registered Users and variations among existing customers and new customers with respect to the mix of purchased solutions and related pricing. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operation Measures\" for additional detail on how we define \"Installed Customers\" and \"Registered Users.\"\nWe value restricted stock units at the closing market price on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the restricted stock unit award.\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n (2) Includes stock-based compensation expenses as follows: \nRCFIs, Alt-FIs and FinTechs are seeking to address these challenges and opportunities and capture End User engagement by providing new, innovative digital financial services, solutions and experiences. Traditional financial services providers such as banks and credit unions are experiencing reduced End User engagement in their physical branches and increased End User engagement with their digital services and thus they are increasing their investment in digital services. Emerging providers such as Alt-FIs and FinTechs are leveraging their digital focus and expertise and capitalizing on increased End User demand for digital financial services by creating new and expanding existing digital service offerings. This combined investment by traditional and emerging financial services providers is driving further competition, segmentation and innovation.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2016. Total benefit from (provision for) income taxes increased by $0.7 million from a provision of $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 to a benefit of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2017 resulted from utilization of the R&D tax credits beginning in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nWe anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we add personnel to support our revenue growth and as we increase discretionary marketing spend to attract new customers, retain and grow existing customers and drive brand awareness. We expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over time as our revenues grow.\nIncome Taxes\nOur payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe capitalize sales commissions and other third-party costs, such as third-party licenses and maintenance related to our customer agreements. We capitalize sales commissions because the commission charges are so closely related to the revenues from the non-cancellable customer agreements that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to expense over the same period that the related revenue is recognized. Under the new revenue standard, we capitalize commissions and bonuses for those involved in the sale, including direct employees and indirect supervisors, as these are incremental to the sale. We typically pay commissions in two increments. The initial payment is made after the contract has been executed and the initial deposit has been received from the customer, and the final payment is made upon commencement date. We require that an individual remain employed to collect a commission when it is due. The service period between the first and second payment is considered to be a substantive service period, and as a result, we expense the final payment when made. We begin amortizing deferred solution and other costs for a particular customer agreement once the revenue recognition criteria are met and amortize those deferred costs over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. Upon enactment, we did not have any foreign subsidiaries and the international aspects of the Tax Act were not applicable.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.8 million, or 21.0%, from $37.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $45.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a $5.9 million increase in personnel costs to support the growth of our business including the addition of certain senior executives. The increase in personnel costs includes a $2.3 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to general and administrative expenses for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price and $0.4 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. The remaining increase was attributable to a $0.7 million increase in professional services for legal and consulting fees, a $0.6 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs, a $0.4 million increase in travel and other discretionary expenses, and a $0.2 million increase in sales tax expense and other miscellaneous charges.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Total benefit from income taxes increased by $3.5 million from a benefit of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to a benefit of $3.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in the tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 consisted of a reduction in the valuation allowance of $3.0 million due to the deferred tax liability for the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018 after purchase accounting adjustments. Additionally, $0.5 million of the increase is related to the increase in benefit from the state R&D tax credits and the deferred tax liability release from net operating loss and interest carryovers during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the unit of accounting in the new revenue standard. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have contracts with customers that often include multiple performance obligations, usually including multiple subscription and implementation services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations separately if they are distinct by allocating the contract's total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the relative standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct good or service in the contract. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, we considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the customer's personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. We have concluded that the implementation services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations in the North American banking market are not distinct and, as a result, we defer any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognize such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue for the initial agreement term of the hosted application agreements. We have concluded that outside the North American banking market, the implementation services for our lending\nContract Balances\nWe capitalize certain personnel and other costs, such as employee salaries, benefits and the associated payroll taxes that are direct and incremental to the implementation of our solutions. We analyze implementation costs that may be capitalized to assess their recoverability, and only capitalize costs that we anticipate to be recoverable. We assess the recoverability of our deferred implementation costs by comparing the greater of the amount of the non-cancellable portion of a customer's contract and the non-refundable customer prepayments received as it relates to the specific implementation costs incurred. We begin amortizing the deferred implementation costs for an implementation once the revenue recognition criteria have been met, and we amortize those deferred implementation costs ratably over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been\n805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business\" as of January 1, 2017. Under ASU 2017-01, we first determine whether substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is not a business. If it is not met, we determine whether the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, meets the definition of a business.\nWe capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solution to the extent those costs are considered to be recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for a particular implementation once revenue recognition commences, and we amortize those implementation costs over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\n \u2022 our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance; \nKey Operating Measures\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nWe earn the majority of our transactional revenues based on the number of bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform. We also generate a smaller portion of our transactional revenues from interchange fees generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with our Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services and interchange fees in the month incurred based on actual transactions.\nWe define a Registered User as an individual related to an account holder of an Installed Customer on our digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. We price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of Registered Users, so as the number of Registered Users of our solutions increases, our revenues grow. Our average number of Registered Users per Installed Customer grows as our existing digital banking platform customers add more Registered Users and as we add larger RCFIs to our Installed Customer base. We anticipate that the number of Registered Users will grow at a faster rate than our number of Installed Customers. The rate at which our customers add Registered Users and the incremental revenues we recognize from new Registered Users vary significantly period-to-period based on the timing of our implementations of new customers and the timing of registration of new End Users. Our Installed Customers had approximately 12.8 million, 10.4 million and 8.6 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nBenefit from (provision for) income taxes\nWe intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation and customer support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our customers and support our growth. We expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business but to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues based principally on the level and timing of implementation and support activities and other related costs.\nWe recognize usage revenue related to End Users accessing our solutions in excess of contracted amounts, bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform, and interchange fees that End Users generate using our solutions. Judgment is required to determine the accounting for these types of revenue. We consider various factors including the degree to which usage is interdependent or interrelated to past services, costs to us per End User over the contract, contractual price per End User changes and their relationship to market terms, forecasted data, and our cost to fulfill the obligation. We have concluded that our usage revenue relates specifically to the transfer of the service to the customer and is consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606 when considering all of the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract. Therefore, we recognize usage revenue on a monthly or quarterly basis in accordance with the agreement, as determined and reported. This allocation reflects the amount we expect to receive for the services for the given period.\nPurchase Price Allocation, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and \nRegistered Users\nour implementation activities to help ensure a successful roll-out of the solutions to End Users and increase the registration of new End Users. Unusually long or short implementations, for even a small number of customers, may result in short-term quarterly variability in our results of operations.\n______________________________________________________________________________\nProfessional services revenues, which primarily consist of training, advisory services, core conversion services, web design, and other general professional services, are generally billed and recognized when delivered. Certain out-of-pocket expenses billed to customers are recorded as revenues rather than an offset to the related expense.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $7.0 million, or 16.9%, from $41.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily attributable to a $5.5 million increase in personnel costs due to the growth of our sales and marketing organizations. The increase in personnel costs includes a $2.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense allocated to sales and marketing for the increase in the number of stock-based awards vested during the period and the increased fair value of the awards granted due to the increase in our stock price and $1.0 million in personnel costs from the acquired businesses in the fourth quarter of 2018. In addition, there was a a $0.6 million increase in travel related expenses due to increased employee travel to attract new customers and support our sales and marketing initiatives, $0.5 million increase in facilities and other overhead costs which were allocated to our sales and marketing departments, and a $0.4 million increase in discretionary marketing spend as a result of efforts to drive brand awareness and expanded marketing efforts to attract new customers and retain and grow existing customers.\n \u2022 depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements; \nWe are a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which traditional and emerging financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We sell our solutions to regional and community financial institutions, or RCFIs, alternative finance and leasing companies, or Alt-FIs, and financial technology companies, or FinTechs. Our solutions enable our customers to deliver robust suites of digital banking, lending, leasing, and banking as a service, or BaaS, services that make it possible for End Users to transact and engage anytime, anywhere and on any device. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As such, we purpose-build our solutions to deliver compelling and consistent End User experiences across digital channels and to drive the success of our customers by optimizing their digital brands and enhancing End User acquisition, retention and engagement.\nThe effective delivery and management of secure and advanced digital solutions in the complex and heavily-regulated financial services industry requires significant resources, personnel and expertise. We provide digital solutions that are designed to be highly configurable, scalable and adaptable to the specific needs of our customers. We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are also designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers and their End Users.\nAcquisition related costs include compensation expenses related to milestone provisions and retention agreements with certain former shareholders and employees of acquired businesses which are recognized as earned, and various legal and professional service expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions, which were recognized when incurred.\n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments; \nDeferred Revenues\nConsolidated Statements of Operations Data\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of significant judgments and estimates by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was $171.3 million, consisting primarily of $130.7 million for the acquisitions of Cloud Lending and Gro and release of the hold back from the asset acquisition in 2017, $75.7 million for the purchase of investments, and $13.3 million for the purchase of property and equipment. These outflows were partially offset by $48.4 million received from the maturities of investments.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017. Amortization of acquired intangibles increased by $0.4 million, or 24.5%, from $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to $1.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 included the amortization of acquired intangible assets purchased in the fourth quarter of 2018 from Cloud Lending and Gro, as well as acquired intangible asset amortization related to our business combinations in 2015 and asset purchase in 2017. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 was comprised of acquired intangible asset amortization related to our business combinations in 2015 and asset purchase in 2017. These amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nCertain research and development costs that are related to our software development, which include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions, are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheet.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe account for uncertain tax positions by recognizing the financial statement effects of a tax position only when, based upon technical merits, it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination. We recognize potential accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax positions within our global operations in income tax expense.\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of investments in growing our business. The timing of our implementation activities and corresponding revenues from new customers are subject to fluctuation based on the timing of our sales. Sales may tend to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in subsequent quarters but any resulting impact on our results of operation has been difficult to measure due to the timing of our implementations and overall growth in our business. The timing of our implementations also varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. Our solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As a result, we and our customers are very deliberate and careful in\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our professional sales organization. While the RCFI market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, the Alt-FI and FinTech markets are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. We intend to add sales representatives to identify and address the RCFI, Alt-FI and FinTech markets across the U.S. and internationally. We also expect to increase our number of sales support and marketing personnel, as well as our investment in marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our solutions and generate new customer opportunities.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nResults of Operations\nOur recent financing activities have consisted primarily of our February 2018 Convertible Note financing, net proceeds from exercises of options to purchase our common stock, as well as payments on financing obligations and payments on capital lease obligations.\nWe sometimes provide credits or incentives to our customers. Known and estimable credits and incentives represent a form of variable consideration, which are estimated at contract inception and reduce the revenues recognized for a particular contract. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration as of December 31, 2018.\nprimarily of $20.9 million of stock-based compensation expense, $14.9 million of depreciation and amortization expense, and $7.5 million of amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs.\nIn November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, \"Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,\" which provides guidance on the classification of restricted cash in the statement of cash flows. We adopted this ASU retrospectively, effective January 1, 2018. As a result, we included restricted cash with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows, resulting in an increase in net cash of $1.8 million for fiscal 2018 and $2.3 million for fiscal 2017.", "item_7_tables": "Table 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

24.3% from 2017. The increase was driven by growth in registered users and additional solutions sold to new and existing customers.\n\n- Net loss for 2018 was $35.4 million compared to $26.2 million in 2017. The wider loss was due to higher operating expenses.\n\n- Cash used in investing activities was $171.3 million in 2018, primarily for acquisitions of Cloud Lending and Gro as well as purchases of investments and property/equipment. \n\n- Cash from financing activities was $216.6 million in 2018, primarily from issuing $230 million in convertible senior notes and related transactions. \n\n- Deferred revenues increased due to higher customer prepayments before revenue recognition. Deferred implementation costs rose due to increased customer growth and ongoing implementations.\n\n- Operating expenses increased driven by more investment in sales, R&D and infrastructure to support growth. Stock-based compensation also rose.\n\n- The company continues investing to expand its digital banking platform and broaden its solutions. It is focused on innovation and enhancing offerings to meet changing customer needs.\n\nIn summary, the company continued strong growth in 2018 but at a wider net loss due to investing for expansion. It is financing these investments through issuance of convertible notes and cash from operations."}
