Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBackground\nWe were initially formed in 2007 as GHL Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company. In 2009, we acquired all the outstanding equity in Iridium Holdings LLC and changed our name to Iridium Communications Inc.\nOverview of Our Business\nWe are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites. We are the second largest provider of satellite-based mobile voice and data communications services based on revenue, and the only commercial provider of communications services offering true global coverage. Our satellite network provides communications services to regions of the world where telecommunications networks do not exist or are impaired, including extremely remote or rural land areas, airways, open ocean, the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters.\nWe provide voice and data communications services to businesses, the U.S. and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers via our satellite network, which has an architecture of 66 operational satellites with in-orbit spares and related ground infrastructure. We utilize an interlinked mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks. This unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation, which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence.\nWe sell our products and services to commercial end users through a wholesale distribution network, encompassing approximately 65 service providers, approximately 195 value-added resellers, or VARs, and approximately 80 value-added manufacturers, or VAMs, who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers, VARs or dealers. These distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications for our products and services targeting specific lines of business.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately 850,000 billable subscribers worldwide, an increase of 68,000, or 9%, from approximately 782,000 billable subscribers at December 31, 2015. We have a diverse customer base, including end users in the following lines of business: land mobile; machine-to-machine, or M2M; maritime; aviation; and government.\nWe recognize revenue from both the provision of services and the sale of equipment. Service revenue represented 77% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Voice, data and M2M data service revenue have historically generated higher gross margins than subscriber equipment revenue.\nWe are currently devoting a substantial part of our resources to develop Iridium NEXT, our next-generation satellite constellation, along with the development of new product and service offerings, upgrades to our current services, and hardware and software upgrades to maintain our ground infrastructure. We estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure upgrades through 2018 to be approximately $3 billion. We expect to fund the costs of Iridium NEXT with the substantial majority of the funds from our $1.8 billion loan facility, or the Credit Facility, which was fully drawn in February 2017, as well as cash on hand and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads.\nIn 2015, we began construction on gateway and ground stations in Russia to support our voice and data satellite communications services to commercial and government subscribers through a local subsidiary and its authorized Russian service providers. Construction on the gateway and ground stations was completed in 2016.\nWe believe that our liquidity sources will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nFull Scale Development and Launch Services Agreements\nIn June 2010, we executed a primarily fixed price full scale development contract, or FSD, with Thales Alenia Space France, or Thales, for the design and manufacture of satellites for Iridium NEXT. The total price under the FSD will be approximately $2.3 billion, and we expect our payment obligations under the FSD to extend through 2018. As of December 31, 2016, we had made total payments of $1,753.6 million to Thales, of which $1,490.6 million were from borrowings under the Credit Facility, which are classified within property and equipment, net, in our consolidated balance sheet included in this report. We have used the Credit Facility to pay 85% of each invoice received from Thales under the FSD with the remaining 15% funded from cash on hand. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017 and, as a result, we will now pay 100% of each invoice received from Thales from\ncash and marketable securities on hand as well as internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads.\nIn March 2010, we entered into an agreement with Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, as the primary launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The contract price under the SpaceX agreement is $468.1 million, which includes the exercise of our reflight option in the event of launch failure. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is configured to carry ten Iridium NEXT satellites to orbit with each launch. In November 2016, we entered into an additional agreement with SpaceX for an eighth Falcon 9 launch for a contract price of $67.9 million. Although we are the customer of record with SpaceX, we have contracted separately with GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, or GFZ, for $31.8 million to share the launch of NASA's two Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On satellites on a specially designed dispenser on the Falcon 9 rocket. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $394.0 million to SpaceX, and received $16.5 million from GFZ. We also maintain a $1.5 million refundable deposit for the reservation of an additional future launch with SpaceX, which is not included in the total contract price.\nIn June 2011, we entered into an agreement with International Space Company Kosmotras, or Kosmotras, as a supplemental launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The Kosmotras agreement originally provided for the purchase of up to six launches with options to purchase additional launches. Each launch can carry two satellites. In June 2013, we exercised an option for one launch to carry two Iridium NEXT satellites. If we do not exercise any additional options, the total cost under the Kosmotras agreement including this single launch will be $51.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $36.8 million to Kosmotras, which were capitalized as construction in process within property and equipment, net. The option to purchase two dedicated launches expired as of December 31, 2013, and in June 2015, we agreed with Kosmotras to replace the remaining options with a new set of options to purchase six dedicated launches. Kosmotras has to date been unable to obtain permission to launch our satellites. We may be unable to recover the amounts already paid to Kosmotras.\nCredit Facility\nIn October 2010, we entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders, which we amended and restated in May 2014. We refer to this amended and restated credit facility, as further amended to date, as the Credit Facility. Ninety-five percent of our obligations under the Credit Facility are insured by Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Ext\u00e9rieur, or COFACE. The Credit Facility consists of two tranches, with draws and repayments applied pro rata in respect of each tranche:\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Tranche A - $1,537,500,000 at a fixed rate of 4.96%; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Tranche B - $262,500,000 at a floating rate equal to the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus 1.95%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with each draw made under the Credit Facility, we borrowed an additional amount equal to 6.49% of such draw to cover the premium for the COFACE insurance. We also paid a commitment fee of 0.80% per year, in semi-annual installments, on any undrawn portion of the Credit Facility. The commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.3 million and is included in other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Funds drawn under the Credit Facility have been used to pay 85% of each invoice issued by Thales under the FSD. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017.\nScheduled semi-annual principal repayments will begin six months after the earlier of (i) the successful deployment of a specified number of Iridium NEXT satellites or (ii) September 30, 2017. The Credit Facility will mature seven years after the start of the principal repayment period. During this repayment period, we will pay interest on the same date as the principal repayments. Prior to the repayment period, interest payments are due on a semi-annual basis in April and October. Interest incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $77.7 million. We capitalize all interest costs incurred pursuant to the Credit Facility during the construction period of the assets; accordingly, we capitalized $77.7 million in interest incurred in 2016. We pay interest on each semi-annual due date through a combination of a cash payment and a deemed additional loan. The $77.7 million in interest incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $33.3 million payable in cash, of which $19.2 million was paid during the year and $14.1 million was accrued at year end, and $44.4 million payable by deemed loans, all of which was paid during the year.\nFollowing the completion of the Iridium NEXT constellation, we may prepay the borrowings subject to the payment of interest makeup costs. We may not subsequently borrow any amounts that we repay. We must repay the loans in full upon a delisting of our common stock, a change in control of our company or our ceasing to own 100% of any of the other obligors, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. We must apply all or a portion of specified capital raise proceeds, insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds and proceeds from the disposal of any interests in Aireon to the prepayment of the loans. The Credit Facility includes customary representations, events of default, covenants and conditions precedent to our drawing of funds.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had borrowed a total of $1,777.8 million under the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was $22.2 million, and the Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017. Under the terms of the\nCredit Facility, we were required to maintain a minimum cash reserve for debt service of $113.0 million as of December 31, 2016, which is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. This minimum cash reserve requirement will increase over the term of the Credit Facility to $189.0 million in 2017.\nIn addition to the minimum debt service reserve levels, financial covenants under the Credit Facility include:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an available cash balance of at least $25 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of total net debt to the aggregate of total net debt and total stockholders' equity, of no more than 0.7 to 1, measured each June 30 and December 31;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified maximum levels of annual capital expenditures (excluding expenditures on the construction of Iridium NEXT satellites) through the year ending December 31, 2024;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified minimum levels of consolidated operational earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or operational EBITDA, for the 12-month periods ending each December 31 and June 30 through December 31, 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified minimum cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads on our satellites measured each December 31 and June 30 from June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a debt service coverage ratio, measured during the repayment period, of not less than 1 to 1.5; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified maximum leverage levels during the repayment period that decline from a ratio of 4.73 to 1 for the twelve months ending June 30, 2018 to a ratio of 2.36 to 1 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur available cash balance, as defined by the Credit Facility, was $382.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 0.51 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. We were also in compliance with the operational EBITDA covenant, the annual capital expenditure covenant and the cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nThe covenants regarding capital expenditures, operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flows are calculated in connection with a measurement, which we refer to as available cure amount, that is derived using a complex calculation based on overall cash flows, as adjusted by numerous measures specified in the Credit Facility. In a period in which our capital expenditures exceed, or our operational EBITDA or hosted payload cash flows falls short of, the amount specified in the respective covenant, we would be permitted to allocate available cure amount, if any, to prevent a breach of the applicable covenant. As of December 31, 2016, we had no available cure amount, although it was not necessary for us to apply any available cure amount to maintain compliance with the covenants. The available cure amount has fluctuated significantly from one measurement period to the next, and we expect that it will continue to do so.\nThe covenants also place limitations on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to carry out mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets, grant security interests, declare, make or pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates incur additional indebtedness, or make loans, guarantees or indemnities. If we are not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility, after any opportunity to cure such non-compliance, or we otherwise experience an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Facility. It is unlikely we would have adequate funds to repay such amounts prior to the scheduled maturity of the Credit Facility. If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the Credit Facility, which include substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries.\nAs of February 23, 2017, we have fully drawn the total $1.8 billion under the Credit Facility.\nBoeing Insourcing Agreement\nBoeing has operated and maintained our satellite constellation under an operations and maintenance agreement since our inception. During 2016, Boeing provided these services to us pursuant to the terms of the Iridium NEXT support services agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, Boeing provided personnel services in support of the development of Iridium NEXT and agreed to operate and maintain Iridium NEXT, including a transitional period that began on January 1, 2015, during which Boeing supported a hybrid operations mode involving network elements from both the first-generation Iridium system and the Iridium NEXT system. Boeing provided these services on a time-and-materials fee basis.\nIn November 2016, we restructured our relationship with Boeing. We entered into an insourcing agreement, pursuant to which we hired, as of January 3, 2017, the majority of the Boeing team that performed the operations and maintenance on our system. This transition will allow us to more directly manage our network and optimize operational expenses going forward. As part of this arrangement, we agreed to pay Boeing a fee of $5.5 million, of which one-half was paid in December 2016 and the remainder will be paid in December 2017. In addition, we entered into a separate development services contract with Boeing, which will dedicate key Boeing personnel to continue the design and growth required for bringing new services and capabilities to the Iridium NEXT network. After the completion of the Boeing insourcing, as of January 3, 2017, we had 393 full-time employees.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nOur industry and customer base has historically grown as a result of:\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increased demand for communications services by disaster and relief agencies, and emergency first responders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a broad wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a growing number of new products and services and related applications;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services and subscriber equipment;

The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of accounts receivable, useful lives of property and equipment, long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, inventory, internally developed software, deferred financing costs, asset retirement obligations, income taxes, stock-based compensation, warranty expenses, loss contingencies, and other estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of these significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor revenue arrangements with multiple elements in which we determine, based on judgment, that the elements qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate the guaranteed minimum arrangement price among the various contract elements based on each element's relative selling price. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence when available, third-party evidence when vendor-specific evidence is not available, or the Company's estimate of selling price when neither vendor-specific evidence nor third-party evidence is available. We determine vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price by assessing sales prices of subscriber equipment, airtime and other services when they are sold to customers on a stand-alone basis. Our determination of best estimate of selling price is consistent with our determination of vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price and we assess qualitative and quantitative market factors and entity-specific factors when estimating the selling price. We recognize revenue for each element based on the specific characteristics of that element.\nWe sell prepaid services in the form of e-vouchers and prepaid cards. A liability is established equal to the cash paid upon purchase for the e-voucher or prepaid card. We recognize revenue from the prepaid services upon the use of the e-voucher or prepaid card by the customer or, if unused, upon the expiration of the right to access the prepaid service. While the terms of prepaid e-vouchers can be extended by the purchase of additional e-vouchers, prepaid e-vouchers may not be extended beyond three or four years, dependent on the initial expiry period when purchased. We do not offer refunds for unused prepaid services.\nRevenue associated with some of our fixed-price engineering services arrangements is recognized when the services are rendered, typically on a proportional performance method of accounting based on our estimate of total costs expected to complete the contract, and the related costs are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue on cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangements to the extent of actual costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned, where such estimated fees are determined using a partial performance method calculation. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes to earned and unearned revenue that could be material to our results of operations.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation, which consists of stock options and restricted stock units, based on the grant date estimated fair value. In the case of restricted stock units, grant date fair value is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The expected vesting of our performance-based RSUs is based upon the probability that we achieve the defined performance goals. The level of achievement of performance goals, if any, is determined by the compensation committee. In the case of stock options, grant date fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recognize stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term of the options. If any of the assumptions we use in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards\nexpected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This approach requires that we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon enacted tax rates for the period in which the deferred tax items are expected to reverse. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in various jurisdictions are reflected in the period of change. Significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resulting tax liabilities as well as our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Our estimates of future taxable income and any changes to such estimates can significantly affect our tax provision in a given period. Significant judgment is required in determining our ability to realize our deferred tax assets related to federal, state and foreign tax attributes within their carryforward periods including estimating the amount and timing of the future reversal of deferred tax items in our projections of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize in the future. We also recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions only when we estimate that it is more likely than not\u201d that the position will be sustainable based on its technical merits. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, this may result in material changes to our income tax provision.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. We apply judgment in determining the useful lives based on factors such as engineering data, our long-term strategy for using the assets, contractual terms related to the assets, laws and regulations that could impact the useful lives of the assets and other economic factors. In evaluating the useful lives of our satellites, we assess the current estimated operational life of the satellites, including the potential impact of environmental factors on the satellites, ongoing operational enhancements and software upgrades. Additionally, we review engineering data relating to the operation and performance of our satellite network.\nWe depreciate our satellites over the shorter of their potential operational life or the period of their expected use. The appropriateness of the useful lives is evaluated on a quarterly basis or as events occur that require additional assessment. Our first-generation satellites are depreciated on a straight-line basis through the earlier of their estimated remaining useful life or the date they are expected to be replaced by Iridium NEXT satellites, which defines the period of their expected use, because we expect this will occur before the end of their operational lives.\nIn addition to the changes made in prior quarters, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives based on the refinement of the launch schedule, health of the first-generation satellites, and deployment plan for our next-generation satellite constellation. As a result, the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites have been extended and are consistent with the expected deployment of Iridium NEXT. We began deployment of our next-generation satellite constellation in January 2017, and, based on the current launch schedule, we expect the final launch to occur in 2018. If our actual operational results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may experience changes in depreciation and amortization expense that could be material to our results of operations. In the event there are changes to the launch schedule of Iridium NEXT satellites, the period of intended use for our first-generation satellites could be affected, also resulting in changes to depreciation and amortization expense that could be material to our results of operations.\nAssets under construction primarily consist of costs incurred associated with the design, development and launch of the Iridium NEXT satellites, upgrades to our current infrastructure and ground systems and internal software development costs. Once these assets are placed in service, they will be depreciated using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. We capitalize interest on the Credit Facility during the construction period of Iridium NEXT. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of our next-generation satellites.\nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\nA portion of our intangible assets consists of our spectrum licenses and trade names which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. We reevaluate the indefinite life determination for these assets periodically to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life.\nWe assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived assets on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist. Historically, we have assessed the possibility of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. We made assumptions and applied judgment in estimating the fair value based on quoted market prices and various other valuation techniques, including replacement costs, discounted cash flows methods and other market multiple analyses. The various valuation techniques require\nsignificant assumptions about future cash flows, replacement cost, revenue growth, capital expenditures, working capital fluctuations, asset life and incremental borrowing rates. In our annual analysis performed in 2016, we chose the optional qualitative assessment to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The qualitative assessment permits companies to assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If a company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, it would not have to quantitatively determine the assets' fair value. Based on the results of this analysis, it was not more likely than not that the intangible assets not subject to amortization were impaired. Therefore, a quantitative analysis was not necessary, and no impairment charge was recorded during the period.\nInternally Developed Software\nWe capitalize the costs of acquiring, developing and testing software to meet our internal needs. Capitalization of costs associated with software obtained or developed for internal use commences when the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Capitalized costs include external direct cost of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and devote time to, the internal-use software project. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point in time at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Internal use software costs are amortized once the software is placed in service using the straight-line method over periods ranging from three to seven years. Judgments and estimates are required in the determination of when development costs should be capitalized. We evaluate and estimate, based on engineering data, when the preliminary project stage is completed and the point when the project is substantially complete and ready for use.\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDirect and incremental costs incurred in connection with securing debt financing are deferred on our balance sheet and amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. The effective interest rate calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates in determining estimated periodic interest expense. The calculation includes assumptions and estimates with respect to future borrowing dates and amounts, repayment dates and amounts, and projected future LIBOR rates. If actual borrowing amounts and dates, repayment amounts and dates, and future LIBOR rates are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes that could be material to our property and equipment, net balance (since we are capitalizing interest expense as part of the cost of Iridium NEXT), deferred financing costs balance, depreciation expense, interest expense, income from operations and net income.\nComparison of Our Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

The EMSS contract replaced our previous EMSS contract which we originally entered into in April 2008. Under the terms of this agreement, authorized customers utilize Iridium airtime services provided through the U.S. Department of Defense's, or DoD's, dedicated gateway. These services include unlimited global secure and unsecure voice, low and high-speed data, paging, broadcast and Distributed Tactical Communications System, or DTCS, services for an unlimited number of DoD and other federal subscribers. DTCS is a service that provides beyond-line-of-sight, netted tactical radio service for user-defined groups. The service fee under the EMSS contract is $88 million per year for the remaining term.\nGovernment service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $88.0 million from $75.1 million in the prior year as a result of the scheduled price increase under the EMSS contract.\nSubscriber Equipment Revenue\nSubscriber equipment revenue increased by $0.6 million, or 1%, to $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of Iridium Pilot\u00ae terminals and M2M devices partially offset by fewer sales of handsets and L-Band transceivers.\nEngineering and Support Service Revenue\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEngineering and support service revenue increased by $3.9 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a DoD contract entered into in late 2015 to adapt the Iridium Extreme\u00ae handset for DoD use.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of network engineering and operations staff, including contractors, software maintenance, product support services and cost of services for government and commercial engineering and support service revenue.\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $4.7 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in scope of work for government sponsored contracts, partially offset by lower costs incurred to manage the first-generation satellites.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment\nCost of subscriber equipment includes the direct costs of equipment sold, which consist of manufacturing costs, allocation of overhead, and warranty costs.\nCost of subscriber equipment increased by $3.5 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a decline in the warranty provision for our Iridium OpenPort terminal during the year ended December 31, 2015 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining cost increase is due to a higher volume of Iridium\nPilot terminal sales and M2M device sales, partially offset by decreased sales of handsets and L-Band transceivers and by reduced costs on certain products due to manufacturing cost efficiencies.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing costs as well as legal, finance, information technology, facilities, billing and customer care expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and professional fees, partially offset by lower supplier transition expenses and lower non-income taxes.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.4 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued changes in the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites, partially offset by the addition of new assets and the impairment charges that we recorded during the second quarter of 2016 as a result of two satellites having ceased operations. We updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives throughout 2016. We will continue to evaluate the useful lives of our first-generation satellites through the full deployment of Iridium NEXT as the satellites are placed into service.\nOther Expense\nUndrawn Credit Facility Fees\nThe commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.3 million for the prior year. The decrease of the commitment fee on the undrawn portion directly relates to the increase in the amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility as we continue to finance the development of Iridium NEXT. As we are fully drawn on the Credit Facility as of February 2017, the undrawn portion and related fees will decrease to zero beginning in the second quarter of 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our income tax provision was $67.1 million compared to $66.0 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 90.3% for the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of a one-time non-cash impairment of goodwill in the prior year as well as an increased benefit related to the impact of the Arizona tax law changes (both tax rate and apportionment method) and state apportionment changes in other jurisdictions compared to the prior year. As our current estimates change in future periods, the impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities may change correspondingly.\nNet Income\nNet income was $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $103.9 million from the prior year. This increase in net income was driven by an $87.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge taken in 2015 and the $22.3 million increase in total revenue, which was primarily related to the $12.9 million increase from the EMSS contract. The increase was partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in costs of services as described above.\nComparison of Our Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 and Combined Results

As we continue to innovate and better meet the needs of our customers, additional services not contemplated under the EMSS contract may be provided in future periods at an amount mutually agreed upon by both parties.\nSubscriber Equipment Revenue\nSubscriber equipment revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 6%, to $73.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to decreased unit sales of established handsets, Iridium GO!\u00ae handsets, and Iridium Pilot\u00ae terminals. The decrease was partially offset by higher M2M device unit sales and the sales of our Iridium Extreme PTT handsets which were introduced in 2015.\nOperating Expenses\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $1.8 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower costs related to government contracts and satellite operations.\nCost of Subscriber Equipment\nCost of subscriber equipment decreased by $13.8 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.1 million decline in the warranty provision, primarily related to fewer expected returns of Iridium Pilot units and a decrease in the average repair costs compared to the prior year. The decrease in the warranty provision also included a $0.8 million reduction in expenses resulting from an initiative to replace older Iridium OpenPort units. The remaining decrease in cost of subscriber equipment was due to lower overall sales volume of equipment. The decrease in cost was proportionally greater than the decrease in revenue due to equipment manufacturing efficiencies.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $1.4 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the completion of certain product development activities such as PTT, partially offset by an increase in Iridium NEXT projects including development costs associated with enabling faster data speeds on our network and subscriber equipment.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in non-income taxes and equipment supplier transition costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $20.9 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. Of the total decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015, $11.7 million was related to depreciation and the remaining $9.2 million decrease related to amortization.\nIn addition to changes made during 2014, we updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives in each of the first three quarters of 2015. Based on the results of the analyses and the refinement of the Iridium NEXT launch schedule and deployment plan, the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites were extended and are consistent with the expected deployment of Iridium NEXT. These changes in estimated useful life resulted in a $10.6 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. We will continue to evaluate the useful lives of our first-generation satellites through the full deployment of Iridium NEXT as the satellites are placed into service. Also contributing to the decrease in depreciation expense was a $2.2 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to three of our in-orbit satellites with which we lost communication during the year ended December 31, 2014. We have since replaced the lost satellites with in-orbit spares. We did not lose any satellites in 2015. The decreases described above were partially offset by increases in depreciation expense resulting from additions to property and equipment for ground infrastructure compatible with Iridium NEXT.\nIn addition, amortization expense decreased by $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to the completion of amortization of certain definite-lived intangibles in 2014. These definite-lived intangible assets included customer relationships, core developed technology and software from our 2009 acquisition of Iridium Holdings LLC. These assets were amortized over useful lives of five years.\nOther Expense\nInterest Income, Net\nInterest income, net, decreased by $0.6 million, or 16%, to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to more timely customer collections resulting in lower customer finance charges.\nUndrawn Credit Facility Fees\nThe commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.8 million for the prior year. The decrease of the commitment fee on the undrawn portion directly relates to the increase in the amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility as we finance the development of Iridium NEXT.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther expense, net was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.3 million for the prior year. This change primarily resulted from our share of the 2014 loss from our investment in Aireon LLC. Aireon is accounted for as an equity method investment. As of June 30, 2014, due to our cumulative recognition of our share of Aireon's reported losses, our investment balance in Aireon was zero. To the extent that Aireon continues to incur losses, we will suspend recognition of these losses on our condensed consolidated statement of operations until such time that future Aireon income exceeds cumulative accrued preferred dividends and accumulated suspended losses.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our income tax provision was $66.0 million compared to $41.5 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 90.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 35.6% for the prior year. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of a one-time non-cash impairment of goodwill as well as lower benefit for the impact of the Arizona tax law changes (both tax rate and apportionment method). As our current estimates change in future periods, the impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities may change correspondingly.\nNet Income\nNet income was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $67.9 million, or 91%, from the prior year. This decrease in net income was driven by an $87.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and a $24.5 million increase in our provision for income taxes. The decrease was partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in service revenue, primarily due to the $9.5 million favorable impact of the EMSS contract and a $9.2 million favorable subscriber equipment margin. Also adding to the offset was the $20.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the change in our first-generation satellites' estimated remaining useful lives and completion of amortization related to certain definite-lived intangible assets in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents balance was $371.2 million, and our marketable securities balance was $39.3 million. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, internally generated cash flows, and, until it was fully drawn in February 2017, the Credit Facility. Our principal liquidity requirements over the next twelve months are to meet capital expenditure needs, principally the continued deployment of Iridium NEXT, as well as for working capital, interest and debt service reserve payments on the Credit Facility, and dividends payable on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.\nWe estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related infrastructure upgrades through 2018 to be approximately $3 billion. Our funding plan for these costs includes the substantial majority of the funds available under the Credit Facility, which is now fully drawn as of February 2017, together with cash and marketable securities on hand, and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads. Now that our Credit Facility is fully drawn, we expect to pay each invoice received from Thales and all interest and debt service reserve payments under the Credit Facility from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand, and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads.\nWhile the contracted cash flows from our primary hosted payload customer, Aireon, are interest-bearing if not paid on time, we expect those hosted payload payments will continue to be delayed. Aireon is working to secure contracts with ANSPs, including the FAA, for the sale of Aireon's space-based ADS-B services. Aireon is currently seeking to raise the capital it will need to fund its continued operations and our hosted payload payments. Its ability to fund our hosted payload payments in the previously anticipated timeframe has been adversely affected by delays in its sales efforts to these ANSPs, which we believe in part results from delays in the development, construction and launch of the Iridium NEXT system.\nIn anticipation of potential delays in receipt of the Aireon hosting payments, we entered into discussions with our Credit Facility lenders and Thales to delay or reduce our payment obligations. We have received terms from our lenders to delay our contributions to the cash reserve account for debt repayment, or DSRA, and from Thales to delay some of the construction milestone payments that we otherwise anticipate making in 2017 and 2018 under our full scale development contract, or FSD; however, we would need full payment of the Aireon hosting fees or other financing arrangements by the first quarter of 2019 in order to make these deferred payments. The terms from our lenders also contemplate the temporary suspension of dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, but do not include any requirements that we raise additional equity. These terms would permit us to maintain liquidity well into 2108.\nThere can be no assurance that our internally generated cash flows, including those from hosted payloads on our Iridium NEXT satellites, will meet our current expectations. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows, or if the cost of implementing Iridium NEXT or the other elements of our business plan are higher than anticipated, we may need further external funding. Our ability to obtain additional funding may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including global economic conditions, and such funding may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we are not able to secure such funding in a timely manner, our ability to maintain our network, to design, build and launch Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure, products and services, and to pursue additional growth opportunities will be impaired, and we would likely need to delay some elements of our Iridium NEXT development. Our liquidity and our ability to fund our liquidity requirements also depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of $7.00 and $16.875 per share, respectively. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. For each full quarter that the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, is outstanding, and assuming that no shares have been converted into common stock, we are required to pay cash dividends of $1.75 million and $2.1 million, respectively. We expect that we will satisfy dividend requirements, if and when declared, from internally generated cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we reported $1,657.1 million in borrowings under the Credit Facility in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, net of $120.7 million of deferred financing costs, for an aggregate balance of $1,777.8 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was $22.2 million. In February 2017, we borrowed the remaining portion of the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, we maintain the DSRA. As of December 31, 2016, the DSRA balance was $113.0 million, which is classified as restricted cash in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The DSRA requirement is scheduled to increase to $189.0 million in 2017. In addition to the minimum debt service levels, financial covenants under the Credit Facility, as amended to date, include:\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an available cash balance of at least $25 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of total net debt to the aggregate of total net debt and total stockholders' equity, of no more than 0.7 to 1, measured each June 30 and December 31;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified maximum levels of annual capital expenditures (excluding expenditures on the construction of Iridium NEXT satellites) through the year ending December 31, 2024;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified minimum levels of consolidated operational earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or operational EBITDA, for the 12-month periods ending each December 31 and June 30 through December 31, 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified minimum cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads on our satellites, measured each December 31 and June 30, from June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2017;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a debt service coverage ratio, measured during the repayment period, of not less than 1 to 1.5; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specified maximum leverage levels during the repayment period that decline from a ratio of 4.73 to 1 for the twelve months ending June 30, 2018 to a ratio of 2.36 to 1 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur available cash balance, as defined by the Credit Facility, was $382.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 0.51 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. We were also in compliance with the operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flow covenants and the annual capital expenditure covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nThe covenants regarding capital expenditures, operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flows are calculated in connection with a measurement, which we refer to as available cure amount, that is derived using a complex calculation based on overall cash flows, as adjusted by numerous measures specified in the Credit Facility. In a period in which our capital expenditures exceed, or our operational EBITDA or hosted payload cash flows falls short of, the amount specified in the respective covenant, we would be permitted to allocate available cure amount, if any, to prevent a breach of the applicable covenant. As of December 31, 2016, we had no available cure amount, although it was not necessary for us to apply any available cure amount to maintain compliance with the covenants. The available cure amount has fluctuated significantly from one measurement period to the next, and we expect that it will continue to do so.\nThe covenants also place limitations on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to carry out mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets, grant security interests, declare, make or pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur additional indebtedness, or make loans, guarantees or indemnities. If we are not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility, after any opportunity to cure such non-compliance, or we otherwise experience an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Facility. It is unlikely we would have adequate funds to repay such amounts prior to the scheduled maturity of the Credit Facility. If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the Credit Facility, which include substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries.\nWe believe that our liquidity sources will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCash and Indebtedness\nAt December 31, 2016, our total cash equivalents balance was $371.2 million, our total marketable securities balance was $39.3 million, and we had an aggregate of $1,657.1 million of external indebtedness related to borrowings under the Credit Facility.\nCash Flows - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table shows our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> Statement of Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 225.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 217.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (242.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (439.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 197.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 197.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $7.7 million from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to improvements in net income, excluding the 2015 non-cash goodwill impairment, and a decrease in certain product inventory during 2016 as a result of improved inventory management. These changes were offset by payments for the in-orbit portion of insurance to support the Iridium NEXT launch campaign.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $197.0 million primarily due to the increase in net sales of marketable securities of $107.9 million and the $89.1 million decrease in capital expenditures related to the construction of Iridium NEXT.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $5.1 million primarily due to the $21.1 million increase in borrowings under the credit facility, offset by the $17.0 million increase in the restricted cash balance related to the DSRA.\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was an increase in cash of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year.

This increase was primarily due to changes in working capital requirements compared to the prior year.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $186.9 million primarily due to the increase in net sales of marketable securities by $240.6 million, offset by a $53.7 million increase in capital expenditures related to the construction of Iridium NEXT.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $241.7 million primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of $219.7 million from the sale of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock during the second quarter of 2014; no similar proceeds were received in 2015.

If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the Credit Facility, which include substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries.\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Revenue in millions and subscribers in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Billable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Billable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Billable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Subscribers (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Subscribers (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Subscribers\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government service revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 reliance on a few significant customers, particularly agencies of the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our revenue, as a result of which the loss or decline in business with any of these customers may negatively impact our revenue and collectability of related accounts receivable. \nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td> Statement of Cash Flows\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 225.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 217.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (242.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (439.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 197.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 197.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nScheduled semi-annual principal repayments will begin six months after the earlier of (i) the successful deployment of a specified number of Iridium NEXT satellites or (ii) September 30, 2017. The Credit Facility will mature seven years after the start of the principal repayment period. During this repayment period, we will pay interest on the same date as the principal repayments. Prior to the repayment period, interest payments are due on a semi-annual basis in April and October. Interest incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $77.7 million. We capitalize all interest costs incurred pursuant to the Credit Facility during the construction period of the assets; accordingly, we capitalized $77.7 million in interest incurred in 2016. We pay interest on each semi-annual due date through a combination of a cash payment and a deemed additional loan. The $77.7 million in interest incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $33.3 million payable in cash, of which $19.2 million was paid during the year and $14.1 million was accrued at year end, and $44.4 million payable by deemed loans, all of which was paid during the year.\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $1.8 million, or 3%, for the

In a period in which our capital expenditures exceed, or our operational EBITDA or hosted payload cash flows falls short of, the amount specified in the respective covenant, we would be permitted to allocate available cure amount, if any, to prevent a breach of the applicable covenant. As of December 31, 2016, we had no available cure amount, although it was not necessary for us to apply any available cure amount to maintain compliance with the covenants. The available cure amount has fluctuated significantly from one measurement period to the next, and we expect that it will continue to do so.\nIn addition to the minimum debt service reserve levels, financial covenants under the Credit Facility include:\nWe sell prepaid services in the form of e-vouchers and prepaid cards. A liability is established equal to the cash paid upon purchase for the e-voucher or prepaid card. We recognize revenue from the prepaid services upon the use of the e-voucher or prepaid card by the customer or, if unused, upon the expiration of the right to access the prepaid service. While the terms of prepaid e-vouchers can be extended by the purchase of additional e-vouchers, prepaid e-vouchers may not be extended beyond three or four years, dependent on the initial expiry period when purchased. We do not offer refunds for unused prepaid services.\n \u2022 reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products, services and applications effectively; \nCost of Subscriber Equipment\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing costs as well as legal, finance, information technology, facilities, billing and customer care expenses.\n\nOther expense, net was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.3 million for the prior year. This change primarily resulted from our share of the 2014 loss from our investment in Aireon LLC. Aireon is accounted for as an equity method investment. As of June 30, 2014, due to our cumulative recognition of our share of Aireon's reported losses, our investment balance in Aireon was zero. To the extent that Aireon continues to incur losses, we will suspend recognition of these losses on our condensed consolidated statement of operations until such time that future Aireon income exceeds cumulative accrued preferred dividends and accumulated suspended losses.\n \u2022 Tranche A - $1,537,500,000 at a fixed rate of 4.96%; and \n(1)Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nNet income was $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $103.9 million from the prior year. This increase in net income was driven by an $87.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge taken in 2015 and the $22.3 million increase in total revenue, which was primarily related to the $12.9 million increase from the EMSS contract. The increase was partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in costs of services as described above.\nIn October 2010, we entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders, which we amended and restated in May 2014. We refer to this amended and restated credit facility, as further amended to date, as the Credit Facility. Ninety-five percent of our obligations under the Credit Facility are insured by Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Ext\u00e9rieur, or COFACE. The Credit Facility consists of two tranches, with draws and repayments applied pro rata in respect of each tranche:\nCommercial Service Revenue\n (7) Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other charges, as such fees are not determinable based upon the provisions of our lease agreements. \n \u2022 a debt service coverage ratio, measured during the repayment period, of not less than 1 to 1.5; and \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, commercial voice and data revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to continued declines in airtime usage, partially offset by higher telephony access fees due to a higher weighted-average number of subscribers in 2015 than in 2014. Also offsetting the decline in airtime usage was higher Iridium OpenPort service revenue.\nThe following table shows our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nThe covenants also place limitations on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to carry out mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets, grant security interests, declare, make or pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur additional indebtedness, or make loans, guarantees or indemnities. If we are not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility, after any opportunity to cure such non-compliance, or we otherwise experience an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Facility. It is unlikely we would have adequate funds to repay such amounts prior to the scheduled maturity of the Credit Facility. If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the Credit Facility, which include substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries.\n \u2022 market acceptance of our products; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our income tax provision was $66.0 million compared to $41.5 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 90.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 35.6% for the prior year. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of a one-time non-cash impairment of goodwill as well as lower benefit for the impact of the Arizona tax law changes (both tax rate and apportionment method). As our current estimates change in future periods, the impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities may change correspondingly.\n \u2022 a growing number of new products and services and related applications; \nWe depreciate our satellites over the shorter of their potential operational life or the period of their expected use. The appropriateness of the useful lives is evaluated on a quarterly basis or as events occur that require additional assessment. Our first-generation satellites are depreciated on a straight-line basis through the earlier of their estimated remaining useful life or the date they are expected to be replaced by Iridium NEXT satellites, which defines the period of their expected use, because we expect this will occur before the end of their operational lives.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately 850,000 billable subscribers worldwide, an increase of 68,000, or 9%, from approximately 782,000 billable subscribers at December 31, 2015. We have a diverse customer base, including end users in the following lines of business: land mobile; machine-to-machine, or M2M; maritime; aviation; and government.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. We apply judgment in determining the useful lives based on factors such as engineering data, our long-term strategy for using the assets, contractual terms related to the assets, laws and regulations that could impact the useful lives of the assets and other economic factors. In evaluating the useful lives of our satellites, we assess the current estimated operational life of the satellites, including the potential impact of environmental factors on the satellites, ongoing operational enhancements and software upgrades. Additionally, we review engineering data relating to the operation and performance of our satellite network.\n \u2022 our ability to continue to develop and launch Iridium NEXT; \n (8) As of December 31, 2016, we estimated our uncertain tax positions to be $0.9 million, including penalties and interest. However, we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of the possible future payments for the remaining balance, and therefore the remaining balance has not been reflected in a specified period. \n \u2022 Tranche B - $262,500,000 at a floating rate equal to the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus 1.95%. \n\n \u2022 rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; \nWe provide Iridium airtime and airtime support to U.S. government and other authorized customers pursuant to a five-year EMSS contract executed in October 2013 and managed by DISA. The EMSS contract replaced our previous EMSS contract which we originally entered into in April 2008. Under the terms of this agreement, authorized customers utilize Iridium airtime services provided through the U.S. Department of Defense's, or DoD's, dedicated gateway. These services include unlimited global secure and unsecure voice, low and high-speed data, paging, broadcast and Distributed Tactical Communications System, or DTCS, services for an unlimited number of DoD and other federal subscribers. DTCS is a service that provides beyond-line-of-sight, netted tactical radio service for user-defined groups. The service fee under the EMSS contract is $88 million per year for the remaining term.\n (4) Kosmotras obligations consist of remaining payments to purchase one launch. In June 2013, we exercised an option for one launch to carry two Iridium NEXT satellites. If we do not exercise any additional options, the total cost under the contract including this single launch will be $51.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $36.8 million to Kosmotras. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments to Kosmotras are based on the earliest date we plan to include Kosmotras into our launch profile. \nWe are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites. We are the second largest provider of satellite-based mobile voice and data communications services based on revenue, and the only commercial provider of communications services offering true global coverage. Our satellite network provides communications services to regions of the world where telecommunications networks do not exist or are impaired, including extremely remote or rural land areas, airways, open ocean, the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters.\n \u2022 specified minimum cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads on our satellites measured each December 31 and June 30 from June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2017; \nFollowing the completion of the Iridium NEXT constellation, we may prepay the borrowings subject to the payment of interest makeup costs. We may not subsequently borrow any amounts that we repay. We must repay the loans in full upon a delisting of our common stock, a change in control of our company or our ceasing to own 100% of any of the other obligors, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. We must apply all or a portion of specified capital raise proceeds, insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds and proceeds from the disposal of any interests in Aireon to the prepayment of the loans. The Credit Facility includes customary representations, events of default, covenants and conditions precedent to our drawing of funds.\nWe provide voice and data communications services to businesses, the U.S. and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers via our satellite network, which has an architecture of 66 operational satellites with in-orbit spares and related ground infrastructure. We utilize an interlinked mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks. This unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation, which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence.\n \u2022 improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings; \n \u2022 demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services; \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had borrowed a total of $1,777.8 million under the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was $22.2 million, and the Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017. Under the terms of the\nGovernment Service Revenue\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of $7.00 and $16.875 per share, respectively. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. For each full quarter that the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, is outstanding, and assuming that no shares have been converted into common stock, we are required to pay cash dividends of $1.75 million and $2.1 million, respectively. We expect that we will satisfy dividend requirements, if and when declared, from internally generated cash flows.\nIn March 2010, we entered into an agreement with Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, as the primary launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The contract price under the SpaceX agreement is $468.1 million, which includes the exercise of our reflight option in the event of launch failure. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is configured to carry ten Iridium NEXT satellites to orbit with each launch. In November 2016, we entered into an additional agreement with SpaceX for an eighth Falcon 9 launch for a contract price of $67.9 million. Although we are the customer of record with SpaceX, we have contracted separately with GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, or GFZ, for $31.8 million to share the launch of NASA's two Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On satellites on a specially designed dispenser on the Falcon 9 rocket. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $394.0 million to SpaceX, and received $16.5 million from GFZ. We also maintain a $1.5 million refundable deposit for the reservation of an additional future launch with SpaceX, which is not included in the total contract price.\n \u2022 regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services; \nCost of subscriber equipment increased by $3.5 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a decline in the warranty provision for our Iridium OpenPort terminal during the year ended December 31, 2015 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining cost increase is due to a higher volume of Iridium\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet Income\n \u2022 specified minimum cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads on our satellites, measured each December 31 and June 30, from June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2017; \nCommercial Service Revenue\n \u2022 a debt service coverage ratio, measured during the repayment period, of not less than 1 to 1.5; and \nThe covenants regarding capital expenditures, operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flows are calculated in connection with a measurement, which we refer to as available cure amount, that is derived using a complex calculation based on overall cash flows, as adjusted by numerous measures specified in the Credit Facility. In a period in which our capital expenditures exceed, or our operational EBITDA or hosted payload cash flows falls short of, the amount specified in the respective covenant, we would be permitted to allocate available cure amount, if any, to prevent a breach of the applicable covenant. As of December 31, 2016, we had no available cure amount, although it was not necessary for us to apply any available cure amount to maintain compliance with the covenants. The available cure amount has fluctuated significantly from one measurement period to the next, and we expect that it will continue to do so.\nOur available cash balance, as defined by the Credit Facility, was $382.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 0.51 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. We were also in compliance with the operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flow covenants and the annual capital expenditure covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nIn addition to changes made during 2014, we updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives in each of the first three quarters of 2015. Based on the results of the analyses and the refinement of the Iridium NEXT launch schedule and deployment plan, the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites were extended and are consistent with the expected deployment of Iridium NEXT. These changes in estimated useful life resulted in a $10.6 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. We will continue to evaluate the useful lives of our first-generation satellites through the full deployment of Iridium NEXT as the satellites are placed into service. Also contributing to the decrease in depreciation expense was a $2.2 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to three of our in-orbit satellites with which we lost communication during the year ended December 31, 2014. We have since replaced the lost satellites with in-orbit spares. We did not lose any satellites in 2015. The decreases described above were partially offset by increases in depreciation expense resulting from additions to property and equipment for ground infrastructure compatible with Iridium NEXT.\nOur industry and customer base has historically grown as a result of:\nIn anticipation of potential delays in receipt of the Aireon hosting payments, we entered into discussions with our Credit Facility lenders and Thales to delay or reduce our payment obligations. We have received terms from our lenders to delay our contributions to the cash reserve account for debt repayment, or DSRA, and from Thales to delay some of the construction milestone payments that we otherwise anticipate making in 2017 and 2018 under our full scale development contract, or FSD; however, we would need full payment of the Aireon hosting fees or other financing arrangements by the first quarter of 2019 in order to make these deferred payments. The terms from our lenders also contemplate the temporary suspension of dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, but do not include any requirements that we raise additional equity. These terms would permit us to maintain liquidity well into 2108.\n (3) The total premium is $117.9 million, and as of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $31.5 million. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments are based on SpaceX's targeted launch schedule to complete the NEXT constellation in mid-2018. \nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 specified maximum leverage levels during the repayment period that decline from a ratio of 4.73 to 1 for the twelve months ending June 30, 2018 to a ratio of 2.36 to 1 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024. \nNet income was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $67.9 million, or 91%, from the prior year. This decrease in net income was driven by an $87.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and a $24.5 million increase in our provision for income taxes. The decrease was partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in service revenue, primarily due to the $9.5 million favorable impact of the EMSS contract and a $9.2 million favorable subscriber equipment margin. Also adding to the offset was the $20.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the change in our first-generation satellites' estimated remaining useful lives and completion of amortization related to certain definite-lived intangible assets in 2014.\nWe believe that our liquidity sources will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCredit Facility\nA portion of our intangible assets consists of our spectrum licenses and trade names which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. We reevaluate the indefinite life determination for these assets periodically to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life.\nSubscriber Equipment Revenue\n \u2022 reliance on single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of our subscriber equipment and for some of the components required in the manufacture of our end-user subscriber equipment and our ability to purchase parts that are periodically subject to shortages resulting from surges in demand, natural disasters or other events; and \nSelling, General and Administrative\nIn addition to the changes made in prior quarters, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives based on the refinement of the launch schedule, health of the first-generation satellites, and deployment plan for our next-generation satellite constellation. As a result, the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites have been extended and are consistent with the expected deployment of Iridium NEXT. We began deployment of our next-generation satellite constellation in January 2017, and, based on the current launch schedule, we expect the final launch to occur in 2018. If our actual operational results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may experience changes in depreciation and amortization expense that could be material to our results of operations. In the event there are changes to the launch schedule of Iridium NEXT satellites, the period of intended use for our first-generation satellites could be affected, also resulting in changes to depreciation and amortization expense that could be material to our results of operations.\nWe assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived assets on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist. Historically, we have assessed the possibility of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. We made assumptions and applied judgment in estimating the fair value based on quoted market prices and various other valuation techniques, including replacement costs, discounted cash flows methods and other market multiple analyses. The various valuation techniques require\nOther Expense\n \u2022 our ability to generate sufficient internal cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads, to fund a portion of the remaining costs associated with Iridium NEXT and to support our ongoing business; \n \u2022 competition from other mobile satellite service providers and, to a lesser extent, from the expansion of terrestrial-based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures; \nRevenue\nWe capitalize the costs of acquiring, developing and testing software to meet our internal needs. Capitalization of costs associated with software obtained or developed for internal use commences when the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Capitalized costs include external direct cost of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and devote time to, the internal-use software project. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point in time at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Internal use software costs are amortized once the software is placed in service using the straight-line method over periods ranging from three to seven years. Judgments and estimates are required in the determination of when development costs should be capitalized. We evaluate and estimate, based on engineering data, when the preliminary project stage is completed and the point when the project is substantially complete and ready for use.\nOur results of operations have been subject to seasonal usage changes for commercial customers, and our results will be affected by similar seasonality going forward. March through October are typically the peak months for commercial voice services revenue and related subscriber equipment sales. U.S. government revenue and commercial M2M revenue have been less subject to seasonal usage changes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we reported $1,657.1 million in borrowings under the Credit Facility in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, net of $120.7 million of deferred financing costs, for an aggregate balance of $1,777.8 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was $22.2 million. In February 2017, we borrowed the remaining portion of the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, we maintain the DSRA. As of December 31, 2016, the DSRA balance was $113.0 million, which is classified as restricted cash in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The DSRA requirement is scheduled to increase to $189.0 million in 2017. In addition to the minimum debt service levels, financial covenants under the Credit Facility, as amended to date, include:\nInternally Developed Software\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUndrawn Credit Facility Fees\n \u2022 geographic market expansion through the ability to offer our services in additional countries. \nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.4 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued changes in the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites, partially offset by the addition of new assets and the impairment charges that we recorded during the second quarter of 2016 as a result of two satellites having ceased operations. We updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives throughout 2016. We will continue to evaluate the useful lives of our first-generation satellites through the full deployment of Iridium NEXT as the satellites are placed into service.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nNet Income\nAs of February 23, 2017, we have fully drawn the total $1.8 billion under the Credit Facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nSeasonality\nGovernment Service Revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, total commercial revenue increased $4.9 million, or 2%, primarily due to the increase in M2M of $5.0 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year. The increase in M2M is primarily due to a 15% increase in commercial M2M billable subscribers, offset by slightly lower ARPU. Commercial voice and data remained flat due to continued declines in telephony airtime usage substantially offset by increases in Iridium OpenPort services and push-to-talk, or PTT, services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWhile the contracted cash flows from our primary hosted payload customer, Aireon, are interest-bearing if not paid on time, we expect those hosted payload payments will continue to be delayed. Aireon is working to secure contracts with ANSPs, including the FAA, for the sale of Aireon's space-based ADS-B services. Aireon is currently seeking to raise the capital it will need to fund its continued operations and our hosted payload payments. Its ability to fund our hosted payload payments in the previously anticipated timeframe has been adversely affected by delays in its sales efforts to these ANSPs, which we believe in part results from delays in the development, construction and launch of the Iridium NEXT system.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was an increase in cash of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The exchange rate changes were primarily due to a modest strengthening of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar throughout 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents balance was $371.2 million, and our marketable securities balance was $39.3 million. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, internally generated cash flows, and, until it was fully drawn in February 2017, the Credit Facility. Our principal liquidity requirements over the next twelve months are to meet capital expenditure needs, principally the continued deployment of Iridium NEXT, as well as for working capital, interest and debt service reserve payments on the Credit Facility, and dividends payable on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $20.9 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. Of the total decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015, $11.7 million was related to depreciation and the remaining $9.2 million decrease related to amortization.\n \u2022 our reliance on a single primary commercial gateway and a primary satellite network operations center; \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n (1) Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period. \nInterest Income, Net\nThe following table shows our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of network engineering and operations staff, including contractors, software maintenance, product support services and cost of services for government and commercial engineering and support service revenue.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $197.0 million primarily due to the increase in net sales of marketable securities of $107.9 million and the $89.1 million decrease in capital expenditures related to the construction of Iridium NEXT.\nOther Expense\nDirect and incremental costs incurred in connection with securing debt financing are deferred on our balance sheet and amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. The effective interest rate calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates in determining estimated periodic interest expense. The calculation includes assumptions and estimates with respect to future borrowing dates and amounts, repayment dates and amounts, and projected future LIBOR rates. If actual borrowing amounts and dates, repayment amounts and dates, and future LIBOR rates are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes that could be material to our property and equipment, net balance (since we are capitalizing interest expense as part of the cost of Iridium NEXT), deferred financing costs balance, depreciation expense, interest expense, income from operations and net income.\n \u2022 a debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of total net debt to the aggregate of total net debt and total stockholders' equity, of no more than 0.7 to 1, measured each June 30 and December 31; \nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $2.6 million from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to changes in working capital requirements compared to the prior year.\n (1) Thales obligations consist of commitments under the FSD for the design and manufacture of satellites for Iridium NEXT. We previously used the Credit Facility to pay 85% of each invoice received from Thales under the FSD with the remaining 15% funded from cash on hand. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017, and as a result, we will pay 100% of each invoice received from Thales from cash and marketable securities on hand as well as internally generated cash flow, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $1,753.6 million to Thales. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments to Thales are based on SpaceX's targeted launch schedule to complete the NEXT constellation in mid-2018. \n (2) SpaceX obligations consist of remaining payments to secure SpaceX as the primary launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The total price for seven launches and a reflight option in the event of launch failure is $468.1 million. In November 2016, we entered into an eighth launch with SpaceX to launch five spare satellites and share the services with GFZ. The total price under the SpaceX Agreement for the eighth launch is $67.9 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $394.0 million to SpaceX. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments to SpaceX are based on SpaceX's targeted launch schedule to complete the NEXT constellation in mid-2018. \nWe do not currently have, nor have we had in the last three years, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nexpected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nProperty and Equipment\n \u2022 an available cash balance of at least $25 million; \nWe estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related infrastructure upgrades through 2018 to be approximately $3 billion. Our funding plan for these costs includes the substantial majority of the funds available under the Credit Facility, which is now fully drawn as of February 2017, together with cash and marketable securities on hand, and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads. Now that our Credit Facility is fully drawn, we expect to pay each invoice received from Thales and all interest and debt service reserve payments under the Credit Facility from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand, and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads.\nSubscriber equipment revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 6%, to $73.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to decreased unit sales of established handsets, Iridium GO!\u00ae handsets, and Iridium Pilot\u00ae terminals. The decrease was partially offset by higher M2M device unit sales and the sales of our Iridium Extreme PTT handsets which were introduced in 2015.\nFull Scale Development and Launch Services Agreements\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and professional fees, partially offset by lower supplier transition expenses and lower non-income taxes.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of accounts receivable, useful lives of property and equipment, long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, inventory, internally developed software, deferred financing costs, asset retirement obligations, income taxes, stock-based compensation, warranty expenses, loss contingencies, and other estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nEngineering and support service revenue increased by $3.9 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a DoD contract entered into in late 2015 to adapt the Iridium Extreme\u00ae handset for DoD use.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nOther Income (Expense), net\nSubscriber equipment revenue increased by $0.6 million, or 1%, to $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of Iridium Pilot\u00ae terminals and M2M devices partially offset by fewer sales of handsets and L-Band transceivers.\nAssets under construction primarily consist of costs incurred associated with the design, development and launch of the Iridium NEXT satellites, upgrades to our current infrastructure and ground systems and internal software development costs. Once these assets are placed in service, they will be depreciated using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. We capitalize interest on the Credit Facility during the construction period of Iridium NEXT. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of our next-generation satellites.\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our income tax provision was $67.1 million compared to $66.0 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 90.3% for the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of a one-time non-cash impairment of goodwill in the prior year as well as an increased benefit related to the impact of the Arizona tax law changes (both tax rate and apportionment method) and state apportionment changes in other jurisdictions compared to the prior year. As our current estimates change in future periods, the impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities may change correspondingly.\nInterest income, net, decreased by $0.6 million, or 16%, to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to more timely customer collections resulting in lower customer finance charges.\nOverview of Our Business\n\nResearch and Development\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $4.7 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in scope of work for government sponsored contracts, partially offset by lower costs incurred to manage the first-generation satellites.\nUndrawn Credit Facility Fees\n (6) Debt obligations include amounts drawn under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016. We included the $22.2 million February 2017 draw. We have included interest payments to be made on our fixed and variable rate tranches of the Credit Facility. Interest payments for variable rate debt have been estimated based on the six-month LIBOR forward contracts. We did not include the increase to the DSRA of $76.0 million, as required under the terms of the Credit Facility, from $113.0 million, as of December 31, 2016, to $189.0 million in 2017. The DSRA is classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet \nIn November 2016, we restructured our relationship with Boeing. We entered into an insourcing agreement, pursuant to which we hired, as of January 3, 2017, the majority of the Boeing team that performed the operations and maintenance on our system. This transition will allow us to more directly manage our network and optimize operational expenses going forward. As part of this arrangement, we agreed to pay Boeing a fee of $5.5 million, of which one-half was paid in December 2016 and the remainder will be paid in December 2017. In addition, we entered into a separate development services contract with Boeing, which will dedicate key Boeing personnel to continue the design and growth required for bringing new services and capabilities to the Iridium NEXT network. After the completion of the Boeing insourcing, as of January 3, 2017, we had 393 full-time employees.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n \u2022 our ability to maintain the health, capacity, control and level of service of our first-generation satellites through the completion of Iridium NEXT; \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWe were initially formed in 2007 as GHL Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company. In 2009, we acquired all the outstanding equity in Iridium Holdings LLC and changed our name to Iridium Communications Inc.\nRevenue associated with some of our fixed-price engineering services arrangements is recognized when the services are rendered, typically on a proportional performance method of accounting based on our estimate of total costs expected to complete the contract, and the related costs are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue on cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangements to the extent of actual costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned, where such estimated fees are determined using a partial performance method calculation. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes to earned and unearned revenue that could be material to our results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.8 million for the prior year. The decrease of the commitment fee on the undrawn portion directly relates to the increase in the amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility as we finance the development of Iridium NEXT.\n (1) Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period. \nOur available cash balance, as defined by the Credit Facility, was $382.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 0.51 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. We were also in compliance with the operational EBITDA covenant, the annual capital expenditure covenant and the cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 and the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash and Indebtedness\nWe recognize revenue from both the provision of services and the sale of equipment. Service revenue represented 77% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Voice, data and M2M data service revenue have historically generated higher gross margins than subscriber equipment revenue.\n\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nThe contractual obligations table does not include future payments of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends when, as and if declared from, and including, the date of original issue at a rate of 7.00% per annum of the $100 liquidation preference per share, which is equivalent to an annual rate of $7.00 per share. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends when, as and if declared from, and including, the date of original issue at a rate of 6.75% per annum of the $250 liquidation preference per share, which is equivalent to an annual rate of $16.875 per share. Dividends on both the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. Neither the Series A Preferred Stock nor the Series B Preferred stock has a stated maturity date. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may convert some or all of their outstanding shares to common stock at the stated conversion rate. On or after October 3, 2017, we may at our option cause some or all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into shares of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate if specified conditions are satisfied. On or after May 15, 2019, we may, at our option, convert some or all of the Series B Preferred Stock into the number of shares of common stock that are issuable at the then-applicable conversion rate, subject to specified conditions. We cannot forecast the conversions, if any, of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock to common stock and thus cannot forecast with certainty the amounts of future dividend payments on outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2016, there were 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 500,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding.\nIncome Taxes\nNonetheless, we face a number of challenges and uncertainties in operating our business, including:\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $1.4 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the completion of certain product development activities such as PTT, partially offset by an increase in Iridium NEXT projects including development costs associated with enabling faster data speeds on our network and subscriber equipment.\n (1) Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period. \n \u2022 regulatory requirements in existing and new geographic markets; \nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $7.7 million from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to improvements in net income, excluding the 2015 non-cash goodwill impairment, and a decrease in certain product inventory during 2016 as a result of improved inventory management. These changes were offset by payments for the in-orbit portion of insurance to support the Iridium NEXT launch campaign.\n (9) Unconditional purchase obligations include our agreement with a supplier for the manufacturing of our devices and various commitments with other vendors that are enforceable, legally binding and have specified terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, minimum or variable price provisions, and a fixed timeline. Unconditional purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable by us without penalty. \nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $5.1 million primarily due to the $21.1 million increase in borrowings under the credit facility, offset by the $17.0 million increase in the restricted cash balance related to the DSRA.\n (2) ARPU is calculated by dividing revenue in the respective period by the average of the number of billable subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number of billable subscribers at the end of the period and then dividing the result by the number of months in the period. \nThe commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.3 million for the prior year. The decrease of the commitment fee on the undrawn portion directly relates to the increase in the amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility as we continue to finance the development of Iridium NEXT. As we are fully drawn on the Credit Facility as of February 2017, the undrawn portion and related fees will decrease to zero beginning in the second quarter of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in non-income taxes and equipment supplier transition costs.\nIn June 2010, we executed a primarily fixed price full scale development contract, or FSD, with Thales Alenia Space France, or Thales, for the design and manufacture of satellites for Iridium NEXT. The total price under the FSD will be approximately $2.3 billion, and we expect our payment obligations under the FSD to extend through 2018. As of December 31, 2016, we had made total payments of $1,753.6 million to Thales, of which $1,490.6 million were from borrowings under the Credit Facility, which are classified within property and equipment, net, in our consolidated balance sheet included in this report. We have used the Credit Facility to pay 85% of each invoice received from Thales under the FSD with the remaining 15% funded from cash on hand. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017 and, as a result, we will now pay 100% of each invoice received from Thales from\nIn addition, amortization expense decreased by $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to the completion of amortization of certain definite-lived intangibles in 2014. These definite-lived intangible assets included customer relationships, core developed technology and software from our 2009 acquisition of Iridium Holdings LLC. These assets were amortized over useful lives of five years.\nEngineering and Support Service Revenue\nCredit Facility, we were required to maintain a minimum cash reserve for debt service of $113.0 million as of December 31, 2016, which is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. This minimum cash reserve requirement will increase over the term of the Credit Facility to $189.0 million in 2017.\n (2) Average monthly revenue per unit, or ARPU, is calculated by dividing revenue in the respective period by the average of the number of billable subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number of billable subscribers at the end of the period and then dividing the result by the number of months in the period. ARPU excludes revenue from our non-subscriber satellite, timing, and location service that was launched in the second quarter of 2016. \nCost of Subscriber Equipment\nBoeing Insourcing Agreement\nCost of subscriber equipment decreased by $13.8 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.1 million decline in the warranty provision, primarily related to fewer expected returns of Iridium Pilot units and a decrease in the average repair costs compared to the prior year. The decrease in the warranty provision also included a $0.8 million reduction in expenses resulting from an initiative to replace older Iridium OpenPort units. The remaining decrease in cost of subscriber equipment was due to lower overall sales volume of equipment. The decrease in cost was proportionally greater than the decrease in revenue due to equipment manufacturing efficiencies.\nIn June 2011, we entered into an agreement with International Space Company Kosmotras, or Kosmotras, as a supplemental launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The Kosmotras agreement originally provided for the purchase of up to six launches with options to purchase additional launches. Each launch can carry two satellites. In June 2013, we exercised an option for one launch to carry two Iridium NEXT satellites. If we do not exercise any additional options, the total cost under the Kosmotras agreement including this single launch will be $51.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $36.8 million to Kosmotras, which were capitalized as construction in process within property and equipment, net. The option to purchase two dedicated launches expired as of December 31, 2013, and in June 2015, we agreed with Kosmotras to replace the remaining options with a new set of options to purchase six dedicated launches. Kosmotras has to date been unable to obtain permission to launch our satellites. We may be unable to recover the amounts already paid to Kosmotras.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOperating Expenses\n (5) Boeing obligations represent a new five-year take-or-pay commitment with the execution of the Development Services Agreement and the final payment for the acquisition of the assembled workforce due in December 2017. \nCost of subscriber equipment includes the direct costs of equipment sold, which consist of manufacturing costs, allocation of overhead, and warranty costs.\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n \u2022 specified minimum levels of consolidated operational earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or operational EBITDA, for the 12-month periods ending each December 31 and June 30 through December 31, 2017; \nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\n\n \u2022 a broad wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets; \nDeferred Financing Costs\nPilot terminal sales and M2M device sales, partially offset by decreased sales of handsets and L-Band transceivers and by reduced costs on certain products due to manufacturing cost efficiencies.\nIn connection with each draw made under the Credit Facility, we borrowed an additional amount equal to 6.49% of such draw to cover the premium for the COFACE insurance. We also paid a commitment fee of 0.80% per year, in semi-annual installments, on any undrawn portion of the Credit Facility. The commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.3 million and is included in other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Funds drawn under the Credit Facility have been used to pay 85% of each invoice issued by Thales under the FSD. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017.\n \u2022 a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services and subscriber equipment; and \nSubscriber Equipment Revenue\nComparison of Our Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThere can be no assurance that our internally generated cash flows, including those from hosted payloads on our Iridium NEXT satellites, will meet our current expectations. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows, or if the cost of implementing Iridium NEXT or the other elements of our business plan are higher than anticipated, we may need further external funding. Our ability to obtain additional funding may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including global economic conditions, and such funding may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we are not able to secure such funding in a timely manner, our ability to maintain our network, to design, build and launch Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure, products and services, and to pursue additional growth opportunities will be impaired, and we would likely need to delay some elements of our Iridium NEXT development. Our liquidity and our ability to fund our liquidity requirements also depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGovernment service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to $75.1 million from $65.5 million in the prior year as a result of the scheduled price increase under the EMSS contract. As we continue to innovate and better meet the needs of our customers, additional services not contemplated under the EMSS contract may be provided in future periods at an amount mutually agreed upon by both parties.\nWe account for stock-based compensation, which consists of stock options and restricted stock units, based on the grant date estimated fair value. In the case of restricted stock units, grant date fair value is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The expected vesting of our performance-based RSUs is based upon the probability that we achieve the defined performance goals. The level of achievement of performance goals, if any, is determined by the compensation committee. In the case of stock options, grant date fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recognize stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term of the options. If any of the assumptions we use in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, commercial M2M data revenue increased by $2.9 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year primarily due to a 10% increase in commercial M2M billable subscribers, offset by slightly lower ARPU.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This approach requires that we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon enacted tax rates for the period in which the deferred tax items are expected to reverse. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in various jurisdictions are reflected in the period of change. Significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resulting tax liabilities as well as our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Our estimates of future taxable income and any changes to such estimates can significantly affect our tax provision in a given period. Significant judgment is required in determining our ability to realize our deferred tax assets related to federal, state and foreign tax attributes within their carryforward periods including estimating the amount and timing of the future reversal of deferred tax items in our projections of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize in the future. We also recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions only when we estimate that it is more likely than not\u201d that the position will be sustainable based on its technical merits. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, this may result in material changes to our income tax provision.\nIn 2015, we began construction on gateway and ground stations in Russia to support our voice and data satellite communications services to commercial and government subscribers through a local subsidiary and its authorized Russian service providers. Construction on the gateway and ground stations was completed in 2016.\nsignificant assumptions about future cash flows, replacement cost, revenue growth, capital expenditures, working capital fluctuations, asset life and incremental borrowing rates. In our annual analysis performed in 2016, we chose the optional qualitative assessment to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The qualitative assessment permits companies to assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If a company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, it would not have to quantitatively determine the assets' fair value. Based on the results of this analysis, it was not more likely than not that the intangible assets not subject to amortization were impaired. Therefore, a quantitative analysis was not necessary, and no impairment charge was recorded during the period.\n \u2022 changes in general economic, business and industry conditions, including the effects of currency exchange rates; \nThe accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of these significant accounting policies.\n \u2022 our ability to develop new and innovative products and services for Iridium NEXT; \nOperating Expenses\nFor revenue arrangements with multiple elements in which we determine, based on judgment, that the elements qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate the guaranteed minimum arrangement price among the various contract elements based on each element's relative selling price. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence when available, third-party evidence when vendor-specific evidence is not available, or the Company's estimate of selling price when neither vendor-specific evidence nor third-party evidence is available. We determine vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price by assessing sales prices of subscriber equipment, airtime and other services when they are sold to customers on a stand-alone basis. Our determination of best estimate of selling price is consistent with our determination of vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price and we assess qualitative and quantitative market factors and entity-specific factors when estimating the selling price. We recognize revenue for each element based on the specific characteristics of that element.\n \u2022 specified maximum leverage levels during the repayment period that decline from a ratio of 4.73 to 1 for the twelve months ending June 30, 2018 to a ratio of 2.36 to 1 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024. \n \u2022 specified maximum levels of annual capital expenditures (excluding expenditures on the construction of Iridium NEXT satellites) through the year ending December 31, 2024; \n \u2022 a debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of total net debt to the aggregate of total net debt and total stockholders' equity, of no more than 0.7 to 1, measured each June 30 and December 31; \nAt December 31, 2016, our total cash equivalents balance was $371.2 million, our total marketable securities balance was $39.3 million, and we had an aggregate of $1,657.1 million of external indebtedness related to borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n\nBackground\n \u2022 Aireon's ability to raise sufficient funds to pay hosting fees to us; \nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $186.9 million primarily due to the increase in net sales of marketable securities by $240.6 million, offset by a $53.7 million increase in capital expenditures related to the construction of Iridium NEXT.\n \u2022 specified minimum levels of consolidated operational earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or operational EBITDA, for the 12-month periods ending each December 31 and June 30 through December 31, 2017; \nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in millions):\nCash Flows - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and the Year Ended December 31, 2015",
    "item_7_text": "We sell our products and services to commercial end users through a wholesale distribution network, encompassing approximately 65 service providers, approximately 195 value-added resellers, or VARs, and approximately 80 value-added manufacturers, or VAMs, who either sell directly to the end user or indirectly through other service providers, VARs or dealers. These distributors often integrate our products and services with other complementary hardware and software and have developed a broad suite of applications for our products and services targeting specific lines of business.\nBoeing has operated and maintained our satellite constellation under an operations and maintenance agreement since our inception. During 2016, Boeing provided these services to us pursuant to the terms of the Iridium NEXT support services agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, Boeing provided personnel services in support of the development of Iridium NEXT and agreed to operate and maintain Iridium NEXT, including a transitional period that began on January 1, 2015, during which Boeing supported a hybrid operations mode involving network elements from both the first-generation Iridium system and the Iridium NEXT system. Boeing provided these services on a time-and-materials fee basis.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n \u2022 specified maximum levels of annual capital expenditures (excluding expenditures on the construction of Iridium NEXT satellites) through the year ending December 31, 2024; \nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $241.7 million primarily due to the receipt of net proceeds of $219.7 million from the sale of our common stock and Series B Preferred Stock during the second quarter of 2014; no similar proceeds were received in 2015. In addition, borrowings under the Credit Facility decreased by $21.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year.\nGovernment service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased to $88.0 million from $75.1 million in the prior year as a result of the scheduled price increase under the EMSS contract.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe covenants also place limitations on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to carry out mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets, grant security interests, declare, make or pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates incur additional indebtedness, or make loans, guarantees or indemnities. If we are not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility, after any opportunity to cure such non-compliance, or we otherwise experience an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Facility. It is unlikely we would have adequate funds to repay such amounts prior to the scheduled maturity of the Credit Facility. If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the Credit Facility, which include substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries.\n \u2022 reliance on a few significant customers, particularly agencies of the U.S. government, for a substantial portion of our revenue, as a result of which the loss or decline in business with any of these customers may negatively impact our revenue and collectability of related accounts receivable. \nScheduled semi-annual principal repayments will begin six months after the earlier of (i) the successful deployment of a specified number of Iridium NEXT satellites or (ii) September 30, 2017. The Credit Facility will mature seven years after the start of the principal repayment period. During this repayment period, we will pay interest on the same date as the principal repayments. Prior to the repayment period, interest payments are due on a semi-annual basis in April and October. Interest incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 was $77.7 million. We capitalize all interest costs incurred pursuant to the Credit Facility during the construction period of the assets; accordingly, we capitalized $77.7 million in interest incurred in 2016. We pay interest on each semi-annual due date through a combination of a cash payment and a deemed additional loan. The $77.7 million in interest incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016 consisted of $33.3 million payable in cash, of which $19.2 million was paid during the year and $14.1 million was accrued at year end, and $44.4 million payable by deemed loans, all of which was paid during the year.\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) decreased by $1.8 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year, primarily due to lower costs related to government contracts and satellite operations.\nWe believe that our liquidity sources will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.\n \u2022 an available cash balance of at least $25 million; \n \u2022 Aireon LLC's ability to successfully deploy and market its space-based ADS-B, global aviation monitoring service to be carried as a hosted payload on the Iridium NEXT system; \nTotal revenue increased to $411.4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $408.6 million for the prior year. This increase in total revenue was primarily due to a $7.6 million increase in service revenue. Government service revenue increased by $9.5 million primarily due to the price increase in the Enhanced Mobile Satellite Services, or EMSS, fixed-price government contract. The increases were partially offset by a decrease in subscriber equipment revenue of $4.5 million.\ncash and marketable securities on hand as well as internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads.\nWe are currently devoting a substantial part of our resources to develop Iridium NEXT, our next-generation satellite constellation, along with the development of new product and service offerings, upgrades to our current services, and hardware and software upgrades to maintain our ground infrastructure. We estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure upgrades through 2018 to be approximately $3 billion. We expect to fund the costs of Iridium NEXT with the substantial majority of the funds from our $1.8 billion loan facility, or the Credit Facility, which was fully drawn in February 2017, as well as cash on hand and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads.\nComparison of Our Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 and Combined Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2014\n \u2022 increased demand for communications services by disaster and relief agencies, and emergency first responders; \nThe covenants regarding capital expenditures, operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flows are calculated in connection with a measurement, which we refer to as available cure amount, that is derived using a complex calculation based on overall cash flows, as adjusted by numerous measures specified in the Credit Facility. In a period in which our capital expenditures exceed, or our operational EBITDA or hosted payload cash flows falls short of, the amount specified in the respective covenant, we would be permitted to allocate available cure amount, if any, to prevent a breach of the applicable covenant. As of December 31, 2016, we had no available cure amount, although it was not necessary for us to apply any available cure amount to maintain compliance with the covenants. The available cure amount has fluctuated significantly from one measurement period to the next, and we expect that it will continue to do so.\nIn addition to the minimum debt service reserve levels, financial covenants under the Credit Facility include:\nWe sell prepaid services in the form of e-vouchers and prepaid cards. A liability is established equal to the cash paid upon purchase for the e-voucher or prepaid card. We recognize revenue from the prepaid services upon the use of the e-voucher or prepaid card by the customer or, if unused, upon the expiration of the right to access the prepaid service. While the terms of prepaid e-vouchers can be extended by the purchase of additional e-vouchers, prepaid e-vouchers may not be extended beyond three or four years, dependent on the initial expiry period when purchased. We do not offer refunds for unused prepaid services.\n \u2022 reliance on our wholesale distribution network to market and sell our products, services and applications effectively; \nCost of Subscriber Equipment\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include sales and marketing costs as well as legal, finance, information technology, facilities, billing and customer care expenses.\n\nOther expense, net was $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $4.3 million for the prior year. This change primarily resulted from our share of the 2014 loss from our investment in Aireon LLC. Aireon is accounted for as an equity method investment. As of June 30, 2014, due to our cumulative recognition of our share of Aireon's reported losses, our investment balance in Aireon was zero. To the extent that Aireon continues to incur losses, we will suspend recognition of these losses on our condensed consolidated statement of operations until such time that future Aireon income exceeds cumulative accrued preferred dividends and accumulated suspended losses.\n \u2022 Tranche A - $1,537,500,000 at a fixed rate of 4.96%; and \n(1)Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period.\nSelling, General and Administrative\nNet income was $111.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $103.9 million from the prior year. This increase in net income was driven by an $87.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge taken in 2015 and the $22.3 million increase in total revenue, which was primarily related to the $12.9 million increase from the EMSS contract. The increase was partially offset by a $5.0 million increase in costs of services as described above.\nIn October 2010, we entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of bank lenders, which we amended and restated in May 2014. We refer to this amended and restated credit facility, as further amended to date, as the Credit Facility. Ninety-five percent of our obligations under the Credit Facility are insured by Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Ext\u00e9rieur, or COFACE. The Credit Facility consists of two tranches, with draws and repayments applied pro rata in respect of each tranche:\nCommercial Service Revenue\n (7) Operating lease obligations do not include payments to landlords covering real estate taxes, common area maintenance and other charges, as such fees are not determinable based upon the provisions of our lease agreements. \n \u2022 a debt service coverage ratio, measured during the repayment period, of not less than 1 to 1.5; and \nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, commercial voice and data revenue decreased $4.9 million, or 3%, primarily due to continued declines in airtime usage, partially offset by higher telephony access fees due to a higher weighted-average number of subscribers in 2015 than in 2014. Also offsetting the decline in airtime usage was higher Iridium OpenPort service revenue.\nThe following table shows our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\nThe covenants also place limitations on our ability and that of our subsidiaries to carry out mergers and acquisitions, dispose of assets, grant security interests, declare, make or pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur additional indebtedness, or make loans, guarantees or indemnities. If we are not in compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Facility, after any opportunity to cure such non-compliance, or we otherwise experience an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may require repayment in full of all principal and interest outstanding under the Credit Facility. It is unlikely we would have adequate funds to repay such amounts prior to the scheduled maturity of the Credit Facility. If we fail to repay such amounts, the lenders may foreclose on the assets we have pledged under the Credit Facility, which include substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries.\n \u2022 market acceptance of our products; \n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, our income tax provision was $66.0 million compared to $41.5 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 90.3% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 35.6% for the prior year. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of a one-time non-cash impairment of goodwill as well as lower benefit for the impact of the Arizona tax law changes (both tax rate and apportionment method). As our current estimates change in future periods, the impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities may change correspondingly.\n \u2022 a growing number of new products and services and related applications; \nWe depreciate our satellites over the shorter of their potential operational life or the period of their expected use. The appropriateness of the useful lives is evaluated on a quarterly basis or as events occur that require additional assessment. Our first-generation satellites are depreciated on a straight-line basis through the earlier of their estimated remaining useful life or the date they are expected to be replaced by Iridium NEXT satellites, which defines the period of their expected use, because we expect this will occur before the end of their operational lives.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had approximately 850,000 billable subscribers worldwide, an increase of 68,000, or 9%, from approximately 782,000 billable subscribers at December 31, 2015. We have a diverse customer base, including end users in the following lines of business: land mobile; machine-to-machine, or M2M; maritime; aviation; and government.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Property and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. We apply judgment in determining the useful lives based on factors such as engineering data, our long-term strategy for using the assets, contractual terms related to the assets, laws and regulations that could impact the useful lives of the assets and other economic factors. In evaluating the useful lives of our satellites, we assess the current estimated operational life of the satellites, including the potential impact of environmental factors on the satellites, ongoing operational enhancements and software upgrades. Additionally, we review engineering data relating to the operation and performance of our satellite network.\n \u2022 our ability to continue to develop and launch Iridium NEXT; \n (8) As of December 31, 2016, we estimated our uncertain tax positions to be $0.9 million, including penalties and interest. However, we are unable to reasonably estimate the period of the possible future payments for the remaining balance, and therefore the remaining balance has not been reflected in a specified period. \n \u2022 Tranche B - $262,500,000 at a floating rate equal to the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus 1.95%. \n\n \u2022 rapid and significant technological changes in the telecommunications industry; \nWe provide Iridium airtime and airtime support to U.S. government and other authorized customers pursuant to a five-year EMSS contract executed in October 2013 and managed by DISA. The EMSS contract replaced our previous EMSS contract which we originally entered into in April 2008. Under the terms of this agreement, authorized customers utilize Iridium airtime services provided through the U.S. Department of Defense's, or DoD's, dedicated gateway. These services include unlimited global secure and unsecure voice, low and high-speed data, paging, broadcast and Distributed Tactical Communications System, or DTCS, services for an unlimited number of DoD and other federal subscribers. DTCS is a service that provides beyond-line-of-sight, netted tactical radio service for user-defined groups. The service fee under the EMSS contract is $88 million per year for the remaining term.\n (4) Kosmotras obligations consist of remaining payments to purchase one launch. In June 2013, we exercised an option for one launch to carry two Iridium NEXT satellites. If we do not exercise any additional options, the total cost under the contract including this single launch will be $51.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $36.8 million to Kosmotras. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments to Kosmotras are based on the earliest date we plan to include Kosmotras into our launch profile. \nWe are engaged primarily in providing mobile voice and data communications services using a constellation of orbiting satellites. We are the second largest provider of satellite-based mobile voice and data communications services based on revenue, and the only commercial provider of communications services offering true global coverage. Our satellite network provides communications services to regions of the world where telecommunications networks do not exist or are impaired, including extremely remote or rural land areas, airways, open ocean, the polar regions and regions where the telecommunications infrastructure has been affected by political conflicts or natural disasters.\n \u2022 specified minimum cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads on our satellites measured each December 31 and June 30 from June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2017; \nFollowing the completion of the Iridium NEXT constellation, we may prepay the borrowings subject to the payment of interest makeup costs. We may not subsequently borrow any amounts that we repay. We must repay the loans in full upon a delisting of our common stock, a change in control of our company or our ceasing to own 100% of any of the other obligors, or the sale of all or substantially all of our assets. We must apply all or a portion of specified capital raise proceeds, insurance proceeds, condemnation proceeds and proceeds from the disposal of any interests in Aireon to the prepayment of the loans. The Credit Facility includes customary representations, events of default, covenants and conditions precedent to our drawing of funds.\nWe provide voice and data communications services to businesses, the U.S. and foreign governments, non-governmental organizations and consumers via our satellite network, which has an architecture of 66 operational satellites with in-orbit spares and related ground infrastructure. We utilize an interlinked mesh architecture to route traffic across the satellite constellation using radio frequency crosslinks. This unique architecture minimizes the need for ground facilities to support the constellation, which facilitates the global reach of our services and allows us to offer services in countries and regions where we have no physical presence.\n \u2022 improved data transmission speeds for mobile satellite service offerings; \n \u2022 demand for remote and reliable mobile communications services; \n\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had borrowed a total of $1,777.8 million under the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was $22.2 million, and the Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017. Under the terms of the\nGovernment Service Revenue\nHolders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at an annual rate of $7.00 and $16.875 per share, respectively. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on each March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15. For each full quarter that the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock, as applicable, is outstanding, and assuming that no shares have been converted into common stock, we are required to pay cash dividends of $1.75 million and $2.1 million, respectively. We expect that we will satisfy dividend requirements, if and when declared, from internally generated cash flows.\nIn March 2010, we entered into an agreement with Space Exploration Technologies Corp., or SpaceX, as the primary launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The contract price under the SpaceX agreement is $468.1 million, which includes the exercise of our reflight option in the event of launch failure. The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is configured to carry ten Iridium NEXT satellites to orbit with each launch. In November 2016, we entered into an additional agreement with SpaceX for an eighth Falcon 9 launch for a contract price of $67.9 million. Although we are the customer of record with SpaceX, we have contracted separately with GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, or GFZ, for $31.8 million to share the launch of NASA's two Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On satellites on a specially designed dispenser on the Falcon 9 rocket. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $394.0 million to SpaceX, and received $16.5 million from GFZ. We also maintain a $1.5 million refundable deposit for the reservation of an additional future launch with SpaceX, which is not included in the total contract price.\n \u2022 regulatory mandates requiring the use of mobile satellite services; \nCost of subscriber equipment increased by $3.5 million, or 9%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to a decline in the warranty provision for our Iridium OpenPort terminal during the year ended December 31, 2015 that did not recur in the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining cost increase is due to a higher volume of Iridium\nProvision for Income Taxes\nNet Income\n \u2022 specified minimum cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads on our satellites, measured each December 31 and June 30, from June 30, 2016 through December 31, 2017; \nCommercial Service Revenue\n \u2022 a debt service coverage ratio, measured during the repayment period, of not less than 1 to 1.5; and \nThe covenants regarding capital expenditures, operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flows are calculated in connection with a measurement, which we refer to as available cure amount, that is derived using a complex calculation based on overall cash flows, as adjusted by numerous measures specified in the Credit Facility. In a period in which our capital expenditures exceed, or our operational EBITDA or hosted payload cash flows falls short of, the amount specified in the respective covenant, we would be permitted to allocate available cure amount, if any, to prevent a breach of the applicable covenant. As of December 31, 2016, we had no available cure amount, although it was not necessary for us to apply any available cure amount to maintain compliance with the covenants. The available cure amount has fluctuated significantly from one measurement period to the next, and we expect that it will continue to do so.\nOur available cash balance, as defined by the Credit Facility, was $382.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 0.51 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. We were also in compliance with the operational EBITDA and hosted payload cash flow covenants and the annual capital expenditure covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nIn addition to changes made during 2014, we updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives in each of the first three quarters of 2015. Based on the results of the analyses and the refinement of the Iridium NEXT launch schedule and deployment plan, the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites were extended and are consistent with the expected deployment of Iridium NEXT. These changes in estimated useful life resulted in a $10.6 million decrease in depreciation expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 when compared to the prior year. We will continue to evaluate the useful lives of our first-generation satellites through the full deployment of Iridium NEXT as the satellites are placed into service. Also contributing to the decrease in depreciation expense was a $2.2 million impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2014 related to three of our in-orbit satellites with which we lost communication during the year ended December 31, 2014. We have since replaced the lost satellites with in-orbit spares. We did not lose any satellites in 2015. The decreases described above were partially offset by increases in depreciation expense resulting from additions to property and equipment for ground infrastructure compatible with Iridium NEXT.\nOur industry and customer base has historically grown as a result of:\nIn anticipation of potential delays in receipt of the Aireon hosting payments, we entered into discussions with our Credit Facility lenders and Thales to delay or reduce our payment obligations. We have received terms from our lenders to delay our contributions to the cash reserve account for debt repayment, or DSRA, and from Thales to delay some of the construction milestone payments that we otherwise anticipate making in 2017 and 2018 under our full scale development contract, or FSD; however, we would need full payment of the Aireon hosting fees or other financing arrangements by the first quarter of 2019 in order to make these deferred payments. The terms from our lenders also contemplate the temporary suspension of dividend payments on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock, but do not include any requirements that we raise additional equity. These terms would permit us to maintain liquidity well into 2108.\n (3) The total premium is $117.9 million, and as of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $31.5 million. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments are based on SpaceX's targeted launch schedule to complete the NEXT constellation in mid-2018. \nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 specified maximum leverage levels during the repayment period that decline from a ratio of 4.73 to 1 for the twelve months ending June 30, 2018 to a ratio of 2.36 to 1 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024. \nNet income was $7.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of $67.9 million, or 91%, from the prior year. This decrease in net income was driven by an $87.0 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge and a $24.5 million increase in our provision for income taxes. The decrease was partially offset by a $7.6 million increase in service revenue, primarily due to the $9.5 million favorable impact of the EMSS contract and a $9.2 million favorable subscriber equipment margin. Also adding to the offset was the $20.9 million decrease in depreciation and amortization primarily due to the change in our first-generation satellites' estimated remaining useful lives and completion of amortization related to certain definite-lived intangible assets in 2014.\nWe believe that our liquidity sources will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months.\nCredit Facility\nA portion of our intangible assets consists of our spectrum licenses and trade names which are indefinite-lived intangible assets. We reevaluate the indefinite life determination for these assets periodically to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite life.\nSubscriber Equipment Revenue\n \u2022 reliance on single-source suppliers for the manufacture of most of our subscriber equipment and for some of the components required in the manufacture of our end-user subscriber equipment and our ability to purchase parts that are periodically subject to shortages resulting from surges in demand, natural disasters or other events; and \nSelling, General and Administrative\nIn addition to the changes made in prior quarters, in the fourth quarter of 2016, we updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives based on the refinement of the launch schedule, health of the first-generation satellites, and deployment plan for our next-generation satellite constellation. As a result, the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites have been extended and are consistent with the expected deployment of Iridium NEXT. We began deployment of our next-generation satellite constellation in January 2017, and, based on the current launch schedule, we expect the final launch to occur in 2018. If our actual operational results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may experience changes in depreciation and amortization expense that could be material to our results of operations. In the event there are changes to the launch schedule of Iridium NEXT satellites, the period of intended use for our first-generation satellites could be affected, also resulting in changes to depreciation and amortization expense that could be material to our results of operations.\nWe assess the recoverability of indefinite-lived assets on an annual basis or when indicators of impairment exist. Historically, we have assessed the possibility of impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of the indefinite-lived asset is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized. We made assumptions and applied judgment in estimating the fair value based on quoted market prices and various other valuation techniques, including replacement costs, discounted cash flows methods and other market multiple analyses. The various valuation techniques require\nOther Expense\n \u2022 our ability to generate sufficient internal cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads, to fund a portion of the remaining costs associated with Iridium NEXT and to support our ongoing business; \n \u2022 competition from other mobile satellite service providers and, to a lesser extent, from the expansion of terrestrial-based cellular phone systems and related pricing pressures; \nRevenue\nWe capitalize the costs of acquiring, developing and testing software to meet our internal needs. Capitalization of costs associated with software obtained or developed for internal use commences when the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Capitalized costs include external direct cost of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal-use software as well as payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and devote time to, the internal-use software project. Capitalization of these costs ceases no later than the point in time at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. Internal use software costs are amortized once the software is placed in service using the straight-line method over periods ranging from three to seven years. Judgments and estimates are required in the determination of when development costs should be capitalized. We evaluate and estimate, based on engineering data, when the preliminary project stage is completed and the point when the project is substantially complete and ready for use.\nOur results of operations have been subject to seasonal usage changes for commercial customers, and our results will be affected by similar seasonality going forward. March through October are typically the peak months for commercial voice services revenue and related subscriber equipment sales. U.S. government revenue and commercial M2M revenue have been less subject to seasonal usage changes.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we reported $1,657.1 million in borrowings under the Credit Facility in our condensed consolidated balance sheet, net of $120.7 million of deferred financing costs, for an aggregate balance of $1,777.8 million outstanding under the Credit Facility. The unused portion of the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 was $22.2 million. In February 2017, we borrowed the remaining portion of the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, we maintain the DSRA. As of December 31, 2016, the DSRA balance was $113.0 million, which is classified as restricted cash in our condensed consolidated balance sheet. The DSRA requirement is scheduled to increase to $189.0 million in 2017. In addition to the minimum debt service levels, financial covenants under the Credit Facility, as amended to date, include:\nInternally Developed Software\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nUndrawn Credit Facility Fees\n \u2022 geographic market expansion through the ability to offer our services in additional countries. \nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.4 million, or 5%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to continued changes in the estimated useful lives of the first-generation satellites, partially offset by the addition of new assets and the impairment charges that we recorded during the second quarter of 2016 as a result of two satellites having ceased operations. We updated our analysis of the first-generation satellites' remaining useful lives throughout 2016. We will continue to evaluate the useful lives of our first-generation satellites through the full deployment of Iridium NEXT as the satellites are placed into service.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nNet Income\nAs of February 23, 2017, we have fully drawn the total $1.8 billion under the Credit Facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nSeasonality\nGovernment Service Revenue\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, total commercial revenue increased $4.9 million, or 2%, primarily due to the increase in M2M of $5.0 million, or 8%, compared to the prior year. The increase in M2M is primarily due to a 15% increase in commercial M2M billable subscribers, offset by slightly lower ARPU. Commercial voice and data remained flat due to continued declines in telephony airtime usage substantially offset by increases in Iridium OpenPort services and push-to-talk, or PTT, services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWhile the contracted cash flows from our primary hosted payload customer, Aireon, are interest-bearing if not paid on time, we expect those hosted payload payments will continue to be delayed. Aireon is working to secure contracts with ANSPs, including the FAA, for the sale of Aireon's space-based ADS-B services. Aireon is currently seeking to raise the capital it will need to fund its continued operations and our hosted payload payments. Its ability to fund our hosted payload payments in the previously anticipated timeframe has been adversely affected by delays in its sales efforts to these ANSPs, which we believe in part results from delays in the development, construction and launch of the Iridium NEXT system.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents was an increase in cash of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. The exchange rate changes were primarily due to a modest strengthening of the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar throughout 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total cash and cash equivalents balance was $371.2 million, and our marketable securities balance was $39.3 million. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, internally generated cash flows, and, until it was fully drawn in February 2017, the Credit Facility. Our principal liquidity requirements over the next twelve months are to meet capital expenditure needs, principally the continued deployment of Iridium NEXT, as well as for working capital, interest and debt service reserve payments on the Credit Facility, and dividends payable on our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $20.9 million, or 29%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. Of the total decrease for the year ended December 31, 2015, $11.7 million was related to depreciation and the remaining $9.2 million decrease related to amortization.\n \u2022 our reliance on a single primary commercial gateway and a primary satellite network operations center; \nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n (1) Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period. \nInterest Income, Net\nThe following table shows our consolidated cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities for the years ended December 31 (in millions):\n\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) includes the cost of network engineering and operations staff, including contractors, software maintenance, product support services and cost of services for government and commercial engineering and support service revenue.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $197.0 million primarily due to the increase in net sales of marketable securities of $107.9 million and the $89.1 million decrease in capital expenditures related to the construction of Iridium NEXT.\nOther Expense\nDirect and incremental costs incurred in connection with securing debt financing are deferred on our balance sheet and amortized as additional interest expense using the effective interest method over the term of the related debt. The effective interest rate calculation requires us to make assumptions and estimates in determining estimated periodic interest expense. The calculation includes assumptions and estimates with respect to future borrowing dates and amounts, repayment dates and amounts, and projected future LIBOR rates. If actual borrowing amounts and dates, repayment amounts and dates, and future LIBOR rates are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes that could be material to our property and equipment, net balance (since we are capitalizing interest expense as part of the cost of Iridium NEXT), deferred financing costs balance, depreciation expense, interest expense, income from operations and net income.\n \u2022 a debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of total net debt to the aggregate of total net debt and total stockholders' equity, of no more than 0.7 to 1, measured each June 30 and December 31; \nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $2.6 million from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to changes in working capital requirements compared to the prior year.\n (1) Thales obligations consist of commitments under the FSD for the design and manufacture of satellites for Iridium NEXT. We previously used the Credit Facility to pay 85% of each invoice received from Thales under the FSD with the remaining 15% funded from cash on hand. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017, and as a result, we will pay 100% of each invoice received from Thales from cash and marketable securities on hand as well as internally generated cash flow, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $1,753.6 million to Thales. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments to Thales are based on SpaceX's targeted launch schedule to complete the NEXT constellation in mid-2018. \n (2) SpaceX obligations consist of remaining payments to secure SpaceX as the primary launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The total price for seven launches and a reflight option in the event of launch failure is $468.1 million. In November 2016, we entered into an eighth launch with SpaceX to launch five spare satellites and share the services with GFZ. The total price under the SpaceX Agreement for the eighth launch is $67.9 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $394.0 million to SpaceX. The timing of a portion of the contractual obligation payments to SpaceX are based on SpaceX's targeted launch schedule to complete the NEXT constellation in mid-2018. \nWe do not currently have, nor have we had in the last three years, any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nexpected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nProperty and Equipment\n \u2022 an available cash balance of at least $25 million; \nWe estimate the aggregate costs associated with the design, build and launch of Iridium NEXT and related infrastructure upgrades through 2018 to be approximately $3 billion. Our funding plan for these costs includes the substantial majority of the funds available under the Credit Facility, which is now fully drawn as of February 2017, together with cash and marketable securities on hand, and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads. Now that our Credit Facility is fully drawn, we expect to pay each invoice received from Thales and all interest and debt service reserve payments under the Credit Facility from cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand, and internally generated cash flows, including contracted cash flows from hosted payloads.\nSubscriber equipment revenue decreased by $4.5 million, or 6%, to $73.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily due to decreased unit sales of established handsets, Iridium GO!\u00ae handsets, and Iridium Pilot\u00ae terminals. The decrease was partially offset by higher M2M device unit sales and the sales of our Iridium Extreme PTT handsets which were introduced in 2015.\nFull Scale Development and Launch Services Agreements\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.1 million, or 1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily due to increases in employee-related expenses and professional fees, partially offset by lower supplier transition expenses and lower non-income taxes.\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, collectability of accounts receivable, useful lives of property and equipment, long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, inventory, internally developed software, deferred financing costs, asset retirement obligations, income taxes, stock-based compensation, warranty expenses, loss contingencies, and other estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nEngineering and support service revenue increased by $3.9 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year primarily as a result of a DoD contract entered into in late 2015 to adapt the Iridium Extreme\u00ae handset for DoD use.\nMaterial Trends and Uncertainties\nOther Income (Expense), net\nSubscriber equipment revenue increased by $0.6 million, or 1%, to $74.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year. This increase was primarily due to increased unit sales of Iridium Pilot\u00ae terminals and M2M devices partially offset by fewer sales of handsets and L-Band transceivers.\nAssets under construction primarily consist of costs incurred associated with the design, development and launch of the Iridium NEXT satellites, upgrades to our current infrastructure and ground systems and internal software development costs. Once these assets are placed in service, they will be depreciated using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful lives. We capitalize interest on the Credit Facility during the construction period of Iridium NEXT. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of our next-generation satellites.\nEffect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, our income tax provision was $67.1 million compared to $66.0 million for the prior year. Our effective tax rate was approximately 37.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 90.3% for the prior year. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily related to the impact of a one-time non-cash impairment of goodwill in the prior year as well as an increased benefit related to the impact of the Arizona tax law changes (both tax rate and apportionment method) and state apportionment changes in other jurisdictions compared to the prior year. As our current estimates change in future periods, the impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities may change correspondingly.\nInterest income, net, decreased by $0.6 million, or 16%, to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to more timely customer collections resulting in lower customer finance charges.\nOverview of Our Business\n\nResearch and Development\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) increased by $4.7 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in scope of work for government sponsored contracts, partially offset by lower costs incurred to manage the first-generation satellites.\nUndrawn Credit Facility Fees\n (6) Debt obligations include amounts drawn under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016. We included the $22.2 million February 2017 draw. We have included interest payments to be made on our fixed and variable rate tranches of the Credit Facility. Interest payments for variable rate debt have been estimated based on the six-month LIBOR forward contracts. We did not include the increase to the DSRA of $76.0 million, as required under the terms of the Credit Facility, from $113.0 million, as of December 31, 2016, to $189.0 million in 2017. The DSRA is classified as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet \nIn November 2016, we restructured our relationship with Boeing. We entered into an insourcing agreement, pursuant to which we hired, as of January 3, 2017, the majority of the Boeing team that performed the operations and maintenance on our system. This transition will allow us to more directly manage our network and optimize operational expenses going forward. As part of this arrangement, we agreed to pay Boeing a fee of $5.5 million, of which one-half was paid in December 2016 and the remainder will be paid in December 2017. In addition, we entered into a separate development services contract with Boeing, which will dedicate key Boeing personnel to continue the design and growth required for bringing new services and capabilities to the Iridium NEXT network. After the completion of the Boeing insourcing, as of January 3, 2017, we had 393 full-time employees.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n \u2022 our ability to maintain the health, capacity, control and level of service of our first-generation satellites through the completion of Iridium NEXT; \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWe were initially formed in 2007 as GHL Acquisition Corp., a special purpose acquisition company. In 2009, we acquired all the outstanding equity in Iridium Holdings LLC and changed our name to Iridium Communications Inc.\nRevenue associated with some of our fixed-price engineering services arrangements is recognized when the services are rendered, typically on a proportional performance method of accounting based on our estimate of total costs expected to complete the contract, and the related costs are expensed as incurred. We recognize revenue on cost-plus-fixed-fee arrangements to the extent of actual costs incurred plus an estimate of the applicable fees earned, where such estimated fees are determined using a partial performance method calculation. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes to earned and unearned revenue that could be material to our results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $5.8 million for the prior year. The decrease of the commitment fee on the undrawn portion directly relates to the increase in the amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility as we finance the development of Iridium NEXT.\n (1) Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period. \nOur available cash balance, as defined by the Credit Facility, was $382.0 million as of December 31, 2016. Our debt-to-equity ratio was 0.51 to 1 as of December 31, 2016. We were also in compliance with the operational EBITDA covenant, the annual capital expenditure covenant and the cumulative cash flow requirements from customers who have hosted payloads covenant as of December 31, 2016.\nCash Flows - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 and the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nCash and Indebtedness\nWe recognize revenue from both the provision of services and the sale of equipment. Service revenue represented 77% of total revenue for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Voice, data and M2M data service revenue have historically generated higher gross margins than subscriber equipment revenue.\n\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\nThe contractual obligations table does not include future payments of dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends when, as and if declared from, and including, the date of original issue at a rate of 7.00% per annum of the $100 liquidation preference per share, which is equivalent to an annual rate of $7.00 per share. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends when, as and if declared from, and including, the date of original issue at a rate of 6.75% per annum of the $250 liquidation preference per share, which is equivalent to an annual rate of $16.875 per share. Dividends on both the Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock are payable quarterly in arrears, on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year. Neither the Series A Preferred Stock nor the Series B Preferred stock has a stated maturity date. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock may convert some or all of their outstanding shares to common stock at the stated conversion rate. On or after October 3, 2017, we may at our option cause some or all of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be automatically converted into shares of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate if specified conditions are satisfied. On or after May 15, 2019, we may, at our option, convert some or all of the Series B Preferred Stock into the number of shares of common stock that are issuable at the then-applicable conversion rate, subject to specified conditions. We cannot forecast the conversions, if any, of Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock to common stock and thus cannot forecast with certainty the amounts of future dividend payments on outstanding Series A Preferred Stock. As of December 31, 2016, there were 1,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 500,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock outstanding.\nIncome Taxes\nNonetheless, we face a number of challenges and uncertainties in operating our business, including:\nResearch and development expenses decreased by $1.4 million, or 8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to the completion of certain product development activities such as PTT, partially offset by an increase in Iridium NEXT projects including development costs associated with enabling faster data speeds on our network and subscriber equipment.\n (1) Billable subscriber numbers shown are at the end of the respective period. \n \u2022 regulatory requirements in existing and new geographic markets; \nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $7.7 million from the prior year. This increase was primarily due to improvements in net income, excluding the 2015 non-cash goodwill impairment, and a decrease in certain product inventory during 2016 as a result of improved inventory management. These changes were offset by payments for the in-orbit portion of insurance to support the Iridium NEXT launch campaign.\n (9) Unconditional purchase obligations include our agreement with a supplier for the manufacturing of our devices and various commitments with other vendors that are enforceable, legally binding and have specified terms, including fixed or minimum quantities, minimum or variable price provisions, and a fixed timeline. Unconditional purchase obligations do not include agreements that are cancelable by us without penalty. \nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $5.1 million primarily due to the $21.1 million increase in borrowings under the credit facility, offset by the $17.0 million increase in the restricted cash balance related to the DSRA.\n (2) ARPU is calculated by dividing revenue in the respective period by the average of the number of billable subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number of billable subscribers at the end of the period and then dividing the result by the number of months in the period. \nThe commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility was $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.3 million for the prior year. The decrease of the commitment fee on the undrawn portion directly relates to the increase in the amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility as we continue to finance the development of Iridium NEXT. As we are fully drawn on the Credit Facility as of February 2017, the undrawn portion and related fees will decrease to zero beginning in the second quarter of 2017.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased by $2.8 million, or 4%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year primarily due to an increase in non-income taxes and equipment supplier transition costs.\nIn June 2010, we executed a primarily fixed price full scale development contract, or FSD, with Thales Alenia Space France, or Thales, for the design and manufacture of satellites for Iridium NEXT. The total price under the FSD will be approximately $2.3 billion, and we expect our payment obligations under the FSD to extend through 2018. As of December 31, 2016, we had made total payments of $1,753.6 million to Thales, of which $1,490.6 million were from borrowings under the Credit Facility, which are classified within property and equipment, net, in our consolidated balance sheet included in this report. We have used the Credit Facility to pay 85% of each invoice received from Thales under the FSD with the remaining 15% funded from cash on hand. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017 and, as a result, we will now pay 100% of each invoice received from Thales from\nIn addition, amortization expense decreased by $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year due to the completion of amortization of certain definite-lived intangibles in 2014. These definite-lived intangible assets included customer relationships, core developed technology and software from our 2009 acquisition of Iridium Holdings LLC. These assets were amortized over useful lives of five years.\nEngineering and Support Service Revenue\nCredit Facility, we were required to maintain a minimum cash reserve for debt service of $113.0 million as of December 31, 2016, which is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet. This minimum cash reserve requirement will increase over the term of the Credit Facility to $189.0 million in 2017.\n (2) Average monthly revenue per unit, or ARPU, is calculated by dividing revenue in the respective period by the average of the number of billable subscribers at the beginning of the period and the number of billable subscribers at the end of the period and then dividing the result by the number of months in the period. ARPU excludes revenue from our non-subscriber satellite, timing, and location service that was launched in the second quarter of 2016. \nCost of Subscriber Equipment\nBoeing Insourcing Agreement\nCost of subscriber equipment decreased by $13.8 million, or 25%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to an $8.1 million decline in the warranty provision, primarily related to fewer expected returns of Iridium Pilot units and a decrease in the average repair costs compared to the prior year. The decrease in the warranty provision also included a $0.8 million reduction in expenses resulting from an initiative to replace older Iridium OpenPort units. The remaining decrease in cost of subscriber equipment was due to lower overall sales volume of equipment. The decrease in cost was proportionally greater than the decrease in revenue due to equipment manufacturing efficiencies.\nIn June 2011, we entered into an agreement with International Space Company Kosmotras, or Kosmotras, as a supplemental launch services provider for Iridium NEXT. The Kosmotras agreement originally provided for the purchase of up to six launches with options to purchase additional launches. Each launch can carry two satellites. In June 2013, we exercised an option for one launch to carry two Iridium NEXT satellites. If we do not exercise any additional options, the total cost under the Kosmotras agreement including this single launch will be $51.8 million. As of December 31, 2016, we had made aggregate payments of $36.8 million to Kosmotras, which were capitalized as construction in process within property and equipment, net. The option to purchase two dedicated launches expired as of December 31, 2013, and in June 2015, we agreed with Kosmotras to replace the remaining options with a new set of options to purchase six dedicated launches. Kosmotras has to date been unable to obtain permission to launch our satellites. We may be unable to recover the amounts already paid to Kosmotras.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOperating Expenses\n (5) Boeing obligations represent a new five-year take-or-pay commitment with the execution of the Development Services Agreement and the final payment for the acquisition of the assembled workforce due in December 2017. \nCost of subscriber equipment includes the direct costs of equipment sold, which consist of manufacturing costs, allocation of overhead, and warranty costs.\nCost of Services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)\n \u2022 specified minimum levels of consolidated operational earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or operational EBITDA, for the 12-month periods ending each December 31 and June 30 through December 31, 2017; \nRecoverability of Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives\n\n \u2022 a broad wholesale distribution network with access to diverse and geographically dispersed niche markets; \nDeferred Financing Costs\nPilot terminal sales and M2M device sales, partially offset by decreased sales of handsets and L-Band transceivers and by reduced costs on certain products due to manufacturing cost efficiencies.\nIn connection with each draw made under the Credit Facility, we borrowed an additional amount equal to 6.49% of such draw to cover the premium for the COFACE insurance. We also paid a commitment fee of 0.80% per year, in semi-annual installments, on any undrawn portion of the Credit Facility. The commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the Credit Facility for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.3 million and is included in other income (expense) in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income. Funds drawn under the Credit Facility have been used to pay 85% of each invoice issued by Thales under the FSD. The Credit Facility was fully drawn in February 2017.\n \u2022 a general reduction in prices of mobile satellite services and subscriber equipment; and \nSubscriber Equipment Revenue\nComparison of Our Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThere can be no assurance that our internally generated cash flows, including those from hosted payloads on our Iridium NEXT satellites, will meet our current expectations. If we do not generate sufficient cash flows, or if the cost of implementing Iridium NEXT or the other elements of our business plan are higher than anticipated, we may need further external funding. Our ability to obtain additional funding may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including global economic conditions, and such funding may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we are not able to secure such funding in a timely manner, our ability to maintain our network, to design, build and launch Iridium NEXT and related ground infrastructure, products and services, and to pursue additional growth opportunities will be impaired, and we would likely need to delay some elements of our Iridium NEXT development. Our liquidity and our ability to fund our liquidity requirements also depend on our future financial performance, which is subject to general economic, financial, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGovernment service revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to $75.1 million from $65.5 million in the prior year as a result of the scheduled price increase under the EMSS contract. As we continue to innovate and better meet the needs of our customers, additional services not contemplated under the EMSS contract may be provided in future periods at an amount mutually agreed upon by both parties.\nWe account for stock-based compensation, which consists of stock options and restricted stock units, based on the grant date estimated fair value. In the case of restricted stock units, grant date fair value is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant. The expected vesting of our performance-based RSUs is based upon the probability that we achieve the defined performance goals. The level of achievement of performance goals, if any, is determined by the compensation committee. In the case of stock options, grant date fair value is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. We recognize stock-based compensation on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions, including expected volatility and expected term of the options. If any of the assumptions we use in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were to change significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, commercial M2M data revenue increased by $2.9 million, or 5%, compared to the prior year primarily due to a 10% increase in commercial M2M billable subscribers, offset by slightly lower ARPU.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach. This approach requires that we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded based upon enacted tax rates for the period in which the deferred tax items are expected to reverse. Changes in tax laws or tax rates in various jurisdictions are reflected in the period of change. Significant judgment is required in the calculation of our tax provision and the resulting tax liabilities as well as our ability to realize our deferred tax assets. Our estimates of future taxable income and any changes to such estimates can significantly affect our tax provision in a given period. Significant judgment is required in determining our ability to realize our deferred tax assets related to federal, state and foreign tax attributes within their carryforward periods including estimating the amount and timing of the future reversal of deferred tax items in our projections of future taxable income. A valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts we expect to realize in the future. We also recognize tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions only when we estimate that it is more likely than not\u201d that the position will be sustainable based on its technical merits. If actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, this may result in material changes to our income tax provision.\nIn 2015, we began construction on gateway and ground stations in Russia to support our voice and data satellite communications services to commercial and government subscribers through a local subsidiary and its authorized Russian service providers. Construction on the gateway and ground stations was completed in 2016.\nsignificant assumptions about future cash flows, replacement cost, revenue growth, capital expenditures, working capital fluctuations, asset life and incremental borrowing rates. In our annual analysis performed in 2016, we chose the optional qualitative assessment to test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment. The qualitative assessment permits companies to assess whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If a company concludes based on the qualitative assessment that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, it would not have to quantitatively determine the assets' fair value. Based on the results of this analysis, it was not more likely than not that the intangible assets not subject to amortization were impaired. Therefore, a quantitative analysis was not necessary, and no impairment charge was recorded during the period.\n \u2022 changes in general economic, business and industry conditions, including the effects of currency exchange rates; \nThe accounting policies we believe to be most critical to understanding our financial results and condition and that require complex and subjective management judgments are discussed below. Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 in Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d Please see the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a full discussion of these significant accounting policies.\n \u2022 our ability to develop new and innovative products and services for Iridium NEXT; \nOperating Expenses\nFor revenue arrangements with multiple elements in which we determine, based on judgment, that the elements qualify as separate units of accounting, we allocate the guaranteed minimum arrangement price among the various contract elements based on each element's relative selling price. The selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence when available, third-party evidence when vendor-specific evidence is not available, or the Company's estimate of selling price when neither vendor-specific evidence nor third-party evidence is available. We determine vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price by assessing sales prices of subscriber equipment, airtime and other services when they are sold to customers on a stand-alone basis. Our determination of best estimate of selling price is consistent with our determination of vendor-specific objective evidence of selling price and we assess qualitative and quantitative market factors and entity-specific factors when estimating the selling price. We recognize revenue for each element based on the specific characteristics of that element.\n \u2022 specified maximum leverage levels during the repayment period that decline from a ratio of 4.73 to 1 for the twelve months ending June 30, 2018 to a ratio of 2.36 to 1 for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024. \n \u2022 specified maximum levels of annual capital expenditures (excluding expenditures on the construction of Iridium NEXT satellites) through the year ending December 31, 2024; \n \u2022 a debt-to-equity ratio, which is calculated as the ratio of total net debt to the aggregate of total net debt and total stockholders' equity, of no more than 0.7 to 1, measured each June 30 and December 31; \nAt December 31, 2016, our total cash equivalents balance was $371.2 million, our total marketable securities balance was $39.3 million, and we had an aggregate of $1,657.1 million of external indebtedness related to borrowings under the Credit Facility.\n\nBackground\n \u2022 Aireon's ability to raise sufficient funds to pay hosting fees to us; \nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $186.9 million primarily due to the increase in net sales of marketable securities by $240.6 million, offset by a $53.7 million increase in capital expenditures related to the construction of Iridium NEXT.\n \u2022 specified minimum levels of consolidated operational earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or operational EBITDA, for the 12-month periods ending each December 31 and June 30 through December 31, 2017; \nThe following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016 (in millions):\nCash Flows - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2016 and the Year Ended December 31, 2015",

    "summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Iridium sells products and services for mobile voice and data communications using satellites. They are the second largest provider of satellite-based mobile communications services. \n\n- Revenue was $411.4 million in 2015, up from $408.6 million in 2014. The increase was driven by higher service revenue, especially from government contracts. This was partially offset by lower equipment sales.\n\n- Net income fell to $7.1 million in 2015, down 91% from $75.0 million in 2014. This was primarily due to a $87 million goodwill impairment charge and higher income taxes. \n\n- Cash flow from operations was $217.5 million in 2015, up slightly from $214.9 million in 2014. Cash used in investing activities fell to $439.4 million from $626.3 million, due to less capital spending on satellites. \n\n- Iridium is developing its next generation satellite network, Iridium NEXT, which is estimated to cost $3 billion through 2018. This is being funded by a $1.8 billion credit facility, cash on hand, and internally generated cash flows.\n\n- Key challenges include reliance on US government contracts for a substantial part of revenue, competition, pricing pressures, regulatory requirements, and reliance on a limited number of suppliers.\n\nIn summary, Iridium grew revenue slightly but net income dropped sharply in 2015 due to a goodwill impairment charge. The company is spending heavily on its next generation satellite network but has financing in place. It faces ongoing challenges from competition and regulation."
