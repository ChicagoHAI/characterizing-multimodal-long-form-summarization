Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in this Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an asset management firm offering yield solutions to retail and institutional investors. We focus on credit-related investment strategies, primarily originating senior secured loans to private middle market companies in the U.S. that have revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. We generally hold these loans to maturity. Our national direct origination franchise, with over 85 people, provides capital to the middle market in the U.S. Over the past 15 years, we have provided capital to over 350 companies across 35 industries in North America.\nWe manage two permanent capital vehicles, both of which are BDCs, as well as long-dated private funds and SMAs, focusing on senior secured credit.\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Permanent capital vehicles: MCC and SIC, have a total AUM of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Long-dated private funds and SMAs: MOF II, MOF III, MCOF, Aspect and SMAs, have a total AUM of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had over $5.3 billion of AUM in two business development companies, MCC and SIC, as well as private investment vehicles. Our year over year AUM growth as of December 31, 2016 was 12% and was driven in large part by the growth of our long-dated private funds and SMAs. Our compounded annual AUM growth rate from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2016 was 32% and our compounded annual Fee Earning AUM growth rate of 23%, both of which have been driven in large part by the growth in our permanent capital vehicles. Since September 2015, we received over $1.5 billion of new institutional capital commitments, bringing AUM to over $5.3 billion. Typically the investment periods of our institutional commitments range from 18 to 24 months and we expect our Fee Earning AUM to increase as capital commitments included in AUM are invested.\nIn general, our institutional investors do not have the right to withdraw capital commitments and, to date, we have not experienced any withdrawals of capital commitments. For a description of the risk factor associated with capital commitments, see Risk Factors - Third-party investors in our private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.\u201d\nDirect origination, careful structuring and active monitoring of the loan portfolios we manage are important success factors in our business, which can be adversely affected by difficult market and political conditions, such as the turmoil in the global capital markets from 2007 to 2009. Since our inception in 2006, we have adhered to a disciplined investment process that employs these principles with the goal of delivering strong risk-adjusted investment returns while protecting investor capital. We believe that our ability to directly originate, structure and lead deals enables us to consistently lend at higher yields with better terms. In addition, the loans we manage generally have a contractual maturity of between three and seven years and are typically floating rate, which we believe positions our business well for rising interest rates.\nOur senior management team has, on average, over 20 years of experience in credit, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. We have made significant investments in our corporate infrastructure and have over 85 employees, including over 45 investment, origination and credit management professionals, and over 40 operations, accounting, legal, compliance and marketing professionals, each with extensive experience in their respective disciplines.\nThe significant majority of our revenue is derived from management fees, which include base management fees earned on all of our investment products as well as Part I incentive fees earned from our permanent capital vehicles and from certain of our long-dated private funds. Our base management fees are generally calculated based upon fee earning assets and paid quarterly in cash. Our Part I incentive fees are typically calculated based upon net investment income, subject to a hurdle rate, and are also paid quarterly in cash.\nWe also generally earn performance fees from our long-dated private funds and SMAs. Typically, these performance fees are 15.0% to 20.0% of the total return above a hurdle rate. These performance fees are accrued quarterly and paid after return of all invested capital and an amount sufficient to achieve the hurdle rate of return.\nWe also receive incentive fees related to realized capital gains in our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds that we refer to as Part II incentive fees. Part II incentive fees are payable annually and are calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (i) the sum of cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from (ii) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains. If the amount calculated is positive, then the Part II incentive fee for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of Part II incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then no Part II incentive fee will be payable for such year. As our investment strategy is focused on generating yield from senior secured credit, historically we have not generated Part II incentive fees.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 89%, 89% and 88%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from management fees and performance fees derived primarily from net interest income on senior secured loans.\nOur primary expenses are compensation to our employees, performance fee compensation and general, administrative and other expenses. Compensation includes salaries, discretionary bonuses, stock-based compensation and benefits paid and payable to our employees. Performance fee compensation is related to performance fees, generally consisting of incentive allocations in our long-dated private funds that we grant to certain of our professionals. General and administrative expenses include costs primarily related to professional services, office rent and related expenses, expense support agreement expenses related to SIC, depreciation and amortization, travel and related expenses, information technology, communication and information services, placement fees and third-party marketing expenses and other general operating items.\nRegistered Public Offering of Medley LLC Notes\nOn August 9, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $25.0 million of an aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount. On October 18, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $28.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 at a public offering price of $24.45 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. The notes mature on August 15, 2026 and interest is payable quarterly. The notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at Medley's option on or after August 15, 2019 at a redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan Facility. The notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades thereon under the trading symbol MDLX.\u201d\nOn January 18, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2024 at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount of notes. On February 22, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes at a public offering price of $25.25 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. The notes mature on January 30, 2024 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on April 30, 2017. The notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at Medley's option on or after January 30, 2020 at a redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes. The notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLQ.\u201d\nMedley LLC Reorganization\nIn connection with the initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of Medley Management Inc. on September 29, 2014, Medley LLC amended and restated its limited liability agreement to modify its capital structure by reclassifying the 23,333,333 interests held by the pre-IPO members into a single new class of units ( LLC Units\u201d). The pre-IPO members also entered into an exchange agreement under which they (or certain permitted transferees thereof) have the right, subject to the terms of the exchange agreement, to exchange their LLC Units for shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. In addition, pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability agreement, Medley Management Inc. became the sole managing member of Medley LLC.\nThe pre-IPO owners, are, subject to limited exceptions, prohibited from transferring any LLC Units held by them or any shares of Class A common stock received upon exchange of such LLC Units, until the third anniversary of the date of the closing of the IPO of Medley Management Inc. without the consent of the managing member. Thereafter and prior to the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the closing of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., such holders may not transfer more than 33 1/3% and 66 2/3%, respectively, of the number of LLC Units held by them, together with the number of any shares of Class A common stock received by them upon exchange therefor, without the consent of the managing member.\nOur Structure\nMedley LLC is a partially owned subsidiary of Medley Management Inc., a holding company whose sole asset is its controlling equity interest in Medley LLC. Medley Management Inc. owns 100% of the voting interests in Medley LLC and 19.93% of the issued and outstanding LLC Units of Medley LLC. The remaining LLC Units (80.07%) are held by the Senior Management Owners. The LLC Units do not have voting rights. Medley Management Inc. and the Senior Management Owners have also entered into an exchange agreement under which the Senior Management Owners (or certain permitted transferees) have the right (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), to exchange their equity interests in Medley LLC for shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications.\nMedley Group LLC, an entity wholly-owned by the pre-IPO owners, holds all 100 issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. For so long as the pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel hold at least 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units (excluding those LLC Units held by Medley Management Inc.), which we refer to as the Substantial Ownership Requirement,\u201d the Class B common stock entitles Medley Group LLC, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by it, to a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC that do not themselves hold shares of Class B common stock and entitle each other holder of Class B common stock, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by such other holder, to a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the number of LLC Units held by such holder. For purposes of calculating the Substantial Ownership Requirement, (1) shares of Class A common stock deliverable to the pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel pursuant to outstanding equity awards will be deemed then outstanding and (2) shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units held by any estate, trust, partnership or limited liability company or other similar entity of which any pre-IPO owner or then-current Medley personnel, or any immediate family member thereof, is a trustee, partner, member or similar party will be considered held by such pre-IPO owner or other then-current Medley personnel. From and after the time that the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer satisfied, the Class B common stock will entitle Medley Group LLC, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by it, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC that do not themselves hold shares of Class B common stock and entitle each other holder of Class B common stock, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by such other holder, to a number of votes that is equal to the number of LLC Units held by such holder. At the completion of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., the pre-IPO owners were comprised of all of the non-managing members of Medley LLC. However, Medley LLC may in the future admit additional non-managing members that would not constitute pre-IPO owners. If at any time the ratio at which LLC Units are exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock changes from one-for-one as set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the number of votes to which Class B common stockholders are entitled will be adjusted accordingly. Holders of shares of our Class B common stock will vote together with holders of our Class A common stock as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law.\nHolders of equity interests in Medley LLC (other than Medley Management Inc.) were, subject to limited exceptions, prohibited from transferring any such equity interests that were held by them as of September 23, 2014 (the date of consummation of the IPO of Medley Management Inc.), or any shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock received upon exchange of such LLC equity interests, until September 23, 2017 without Medley Management Inc.'s consent. Thereafter and prior to September 23, 2018 and September 23, 2019, such holders may not transfer more than 33 1/3% and 66 2/3%, respectively, of the number of any shares of Medley LLC's equity interests held by them as of September 23, 2014, together with the number of any shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock received by them upon exchange therefor, without Medley Management Inc.'s consent. While this agreement could be amended or waived by Medley Management Inc., the holders of the equity interests in Medley LLC (other than Medley Management Inc.) have advised us that they do not intend to seek any waivers of these restrictions.\nThe diagram below depicts our organizational structure (excluding those operating subsidiaries with no material operations or assets) as of March 15, 2017:\n____________\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The Class B common stock provides Medley Group LLC with a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC.

Our results of operations, including the fair value of our AUM, are affected by a variety of factors, including conditions in the global financial markets as well as economic and political environments, particularly in the U.S.\nDuring the first half of fiscal year 2016, economic conditions continued to be unpredictable and volatile as it was during fiscal year 2015. However, during the second half of fiscal year 2016, broad economic markets showed stability and loan volumes across the lending spectrum improved. Loan funds received significant inflows while CLO issuances continued to increase in the second half of 2016. Both these factors drove significant volume in the loan market and drove pricing lower. As a result, the opportunity set for appropriate risk-adjusted investments reduced. Our platform provides us the ability to lend across the capital structure and at varying interest rates providing our firm access to a larger borrower subset over time; however, we believe the deployment of capital during fiscal year 2016, was prudent and cautious in-light of the prevailing market conditions.\nIn addition to these macroeconomic trends and market factors, our future performance is dependent on our ability to attract new capital. We believe the following factors will influence our future performance:\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The extent to which investors favor directly originated private credit investments. Our ability to attract additional capital is dependent on investors' views of directly originated private credit investments relative to traditional assets. We believe fundraising efforts will continue to be impacted by certain fundamental asset management trends that include: (i) the increasing importance of directly originated private credit investment strategies for institutional investors; (ii) increasing demand for directly originated private credit investments from retail investors; (iii) recognition by the consultant channel, which serves endowment and pension fund investors, that directly originated private credit is an important component of asset allocation; (iv) increasing demand from insurance companies seeking alternatives to investing in the liquid credit markets; and (v) de-leveraging of the global banking system, bank consolidation and increased bank regulatory requirements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our ability to generate strong, stable returns and retain investor capital throughout market cycles. The capital we are able to attract and retain drives the growth of our AUM, fee earning AUM and management fees. We believe we are well positioned to invest through market cycles given our AUM is in either permanent capital vehicles or long-dated private funds and SMAs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our ability to grow our revenue is dependent on our continued ability to source attractive investments and deploy the capital that we have raised. We believe that the current economic environment provides attractive investment opportunities. Our ability to identify attractive investments and execute on those investments is dependent on a number of factors, including the general macroeconomic environment, valuation, size and the liquidity of these investment opportunities. A significant decrease in the quality or quantity of investment opportunities in the directly originated private credit market, a substantial increase in corporate default rates, an increase in competition from new entrants providing capital to the private debt market and a decrease in recovery rates of directly originated private credit could adversely affect our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The attractiveness of our product offering to investors. We believe defined contribution plans, retail investors, public institutional investors, pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies are increasing exposure to directly originated private credit investment products to seek differentiated returns and current yield. Our permanent capital vehicles and long-dated private funds and SMAs benefit from this demand by offering institutional and retail investors the ability to invest in our private credit investment strategy. We believe that the breadth, diversity and number of investment vehicles we offer allow us to maximize our reach with investors.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The strength of our investment process, operating platform and client servicing capabilities. Following the most recent financial crisis, investors in alternative investments, including those managed by us, have heightened their focus on matters such as manager due diligence, reporting transparency and compliance infrastructure. Since inception, we have invested heavily in our investment monitoring systems, compliance and enterprise risk management systems to proactively address investor expectations and the evolving regulatory landscape. We believe these investments in operating infrastructure will continue to support our growth in AUM.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nManagement Fees. Management fees include both base management fees as well as Part I incentive fees.\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Base Management Fees. Base management fees are generally based on a defined percentage of (i) average or total gross assets, including assets acquired with leverage, (ii) total commitments, (iii) net invested capital, (iv) NAV or (v) lower of cost or market value of a fund's portfolio investments. These fees are calculated quarterly and are paid in cash in advance or in arrears depending on each specific fund. Base management fees are recognized as revenue in the period advisory services are rendered, subject to our assessment of collectability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, we also receive non asset-based management fees that may include special fees such as origination fees, transaction fees and similar fees paid to us in connection with portfolio investments of our funds. These fees are specific to particular transactions and the contractual terms of the portfolio investments, and are recognized when earned.\nTable 178: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Part I Incentive Fees. We also include Part I incentive fees that we receive from our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds in management fees. Part I incentive fees are paid quarterly, in cash, and are driven primarily by net interest income on senior secured loans. Effective January 1, 2016, as it relates to MCC, these fees are subject to netting against realized and unrealized losses. We are primarily an asset manager of yield-oriented products and our incentive fees are primarily derived from spread income rather than trading or capital gains. In addition, we also carefully manage interest rate risk. We are generally positioned to benefit from a raising rate environment, which should benefit fees paid to us from our vehicles and funds.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance Fees. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs may have industry standard carried interest performance fee structures and are typically 15% to 20% of the total return over a 6.0% to 8.0% annualized preferred return. We record these fees on an accrual basis, to the extent such amounts are contractually due but not paid, and we present this revenue as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations. These fees are subject to repayment (clawback).\nThe timing and amount of performance fees generated by our funds is uncertain. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods. Refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d\nGenerally, if at the termination of a fund (and sometimes at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. Medley had not received any distributions of performance fees through December 31, 2016, other than tax distributions, a portion of which is subject to clawback. As of December 31, 2016, we accrued $7.1 million for clawback obligations that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Our actual obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund's life.\nFor any given period, performance fee revenue on our consolidated statements of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not reverse previously recognized performance fees. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reversed $24.0 million of previously recognized performance fees. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reversed $4.4 million and $2.3 million of previously recognized performance fees on a standalone and consolidated basis, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized cumulative performance fees of $7.1 million.\nTable 179: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Part II Incentive Fees. For our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds, Part II incentive fees generally represent 20.0% of each fund's cumulative realized capital gains (net of realized capital\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nlosses and unrealized capital depreciation). We have not received these fees historically, and do not expect such fees to be material in the future given our focus on senior secured lending.\nOther Revenues and Fees. We provide administrative services to certain of our vehicles that are reported as other revenues and fees. Such fees are recognized as revenue in the period that administrative services are rendered. These fees are generally based on expense reimbursements for the portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by certain professionals directly attributable to each respective fund. These fees are reported within total revenues in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nIn certain cases, the entities that receive management and incentive fees from our funds are owned by Medley LLC together with other persons. See Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the manner in which management fees, performance fees and other fees are generated.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits generally includes salaries, discretionary bonuses and benefits paid and payable to our employees. Compensation also includes stock-based compensation associated with the grants of equity-based awards to our employees. Compensation expense relating to restricted stock units that are expected to vest are measured at fair value as of the grant date, and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nGuaranteed payments made to our senior professionals who are members of Medley LLC are recognized as compensation expense. The guaranteed payments to our Co-Chief Executive Officers are performance based and periodically set subject to maximums based on our total assets under management. Such maximums aggregated to $5.0 million, $3.0 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, neither of our Co-Chief Executive Officers received any guaranteed payments.\nPerformance Fee Compensation. Performance fee compensation includes compensation related to performance fees, which generally consists of profit interests that we grant to our employees. Depending on the nature of each fund, the performance fee participation is generally structured as a fixed percentage or as an annual award. The liability is recorded subject to the vesting of the profit interests granted and is calculated based upon the net present value of the projected performance fees. Payments to profit interest holders are payable when the performance fees are paid to Medley LLC by the respective fund. It is possible that we may record performance fee compensation during a period in which we do not record any performance fee revenue or we have a reversal of previously recognized performance fee revenue. We have an obligation to pay our employees a portion of the performance fees earned from certain funds.\nConsolidated Funds Expenses. Consolidated Funds expenses consist primarily of costs incurred by our Consolidated Funds during the year ended December 31, 2014, including professional fees, research expenses, trustee fees and other costs associated with administering these funds. These expenses are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and are allocated to non-controlling interests. As such, these expenses have no material impact on the net income attributable to Medley and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General and administrative expenses include costs primarily related to professional services, office rent, depreciation and amortization, general insurance, recruiting, travel and related expenses, information technology, communication and information services, placement fees, SIC expenses under an investment advisory and expense support and reimbursement agreements and other general operating items.\nOther Income (Expense)\nDividend Income. Dividend income consists of dividends associated with our equity method investment in SIC and our available-for-sale securities. Dividends are recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are declared and expected to be collected.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense relating to debt incurred by us.\nOther Income (Expenses), Net. Other income (expenses), net consists primarily of expenses associated with our revenue share payable, equity income (loss) and unrealized gains (losses) associated with our equity method investments.\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds relates to interest and dividend income generated from the underlying investments securities. Interest and other income are recognized on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. These sources of revenue are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and are allocated to non-controlling interests. As such, these sources of revenue have no direct material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\nInterest Expense of Consolidated Funds. Interest expense of Consolidated Funds relates to interest and dividend income generated from the underlying investments securities attributable to the counterparty to the loan participations. Interest expense on secured borrowings of our Consolidated Funds is recognized on the same basis as the underlying interest and other income. As such, this interest expense has no direct material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments of Consolidated Funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds consists of realized gains and losses arising from dispositions of investments held by our Consolidated Funds. Substantially all of the net investment gains (losses) of our Consolidated Funds are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and allocated to non-controlling interests.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments of Consolidated Funds. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of Consolidated Funds reflects both unrealized gains and losses on investments from periodic changes in fair value of investments held by our Consolidated Funds and the reversal upon disposition of investments of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for those investments. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of Consolidated Funds is generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and allocated to non-controlling interests.\nNet Change in Unrealized Depreciation (Appreciation) on Secured Borrowings of Consolidated Funds. Net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on secured borrowings of Consolidated Funds reflects both unrealized gains and losses from periodic changes in the fair value of these secured borrowings attributable to loan participations of our Consolidated Funds and the reversal upon repayments of these secured borrowings of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for these secured borrowings. The net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on secured borrowings of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the counterparty to the loan participations. As such, these unrealized gains and losses have no material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\nProvision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes. We are treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and are therefore not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. To the extent it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is provided to offset their benefit.\nWe recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit is recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in Consolidated Funds that are consolidated in our financial statements.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests and Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. Net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in our consolidated subsidiaries.\nOur private funds are closed-end funds, and accordingly do not permit investors to redeem their interests other than in limited circumstances that are beyond our control, such as instances in which retaining the limited partnership interest could cause the limited partner to violate a law, regulation or rule. In addition, SMAs for a single investor may allow such investor to terminate\nthe investment management agreement at the discretion of the investor pursuant to the terms of the applicable documents. We manage assets for MCC and SIC, both of which are BDCs. The capital managed by MCC and SIC is permanently committed to these funds and cannot be redeemed by investors.\nManaging Business Performance\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also makes operating decisions and assesses business performance based on the financial and operating metrics and data that are presented without the impact of consolidation of any funds. Core Net Income, Core EBITDA, Core Net Income Per Share and Core Net Income Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management to assess the performance of our business. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and these measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under \u2018\u2018- Results of Operations,'' which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, such measures may be inconsistent with measures presented by other companies. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP, see \u2018\u2018- Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures to Consolidated U.S. GAAP Financial Measures.''\nCore Net Income. Core Net Income is an income measure that is used by management to assess the performance of our business through the removal of non-core items, as well as non-recurring expenses associated with the IPO of Medley Management Inc. It is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to Medley LLC to exclude reimbursable expenses associated with the launch of funds, amortization of stock-based compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock units at the time of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., other non-core items, the income tax impact of these adjustments and, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, adjustments to reverse the effect of the consolidation of Consolidated Funds.\nCore Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Core EBITDA). Core EBITDA is an income measure also used by management to assess the performance of our business. Core EBITDA is calculated as Core Net Income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nCore Net Income Margin. Core Net Income Margin equals Core Net Income divided by total revenue, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, total standalone revenue.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, under U.S. GAAP, we were required to consolidate entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity, including affiliated funds, for which we are the general partner and are presumed to have control, and entities that we conclude are VIEs, for which we are deemed the primary beneficiary. See Critical Accounting Policies - Principles of Consolidation\u201d and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We refer to standalone financial information\u201d or information presented on a standalone basis\u201d as information derived from our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations for periods prior to January 1, 2015 that has been adjusted to eliminate the effects of the Consolidated Funds on our statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014 , revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income on a standalone basis were greater than those presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP because certain revenues recognized from Consolidated Funds were eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, for that year, expenses on a standalone basis were lower than related amounts presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP due to the exclusion of the expenses of the Consolidated Funds.\nKey Performance Indicators\nWhen we review our performance we focus on the indicators described below:\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in thousands, except AUM, share and per share amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated Financial Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Medley LLC\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,002\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Income Margin(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Net Income(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,888\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41,598\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,481\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,721\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,957\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core Net Income Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other Data (at period end, in millions):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,335\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee Earning AUM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,058\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Net Income Margin equals Net income attributable to Medley LLC divided by total revenue and, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, total standalone revenue.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>With respect to the year ended December 31, 2014, Core Net Income includes a pro-forma adjustment to reflect guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members as compensation expense.

Effective January 1, 2015, we deconsolidated our Consolidated Funds as a result of the early adoption of ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we consolidated funds where through our management contract and other interests we were deemed to have the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. As previously described, the consolidation of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds, but had no net effect on the net income attributable to our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 212: <table><tr><td>

Performance fees increased to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a reversal of performance fees of $15.7 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was due to an increase in SMA performance fees accrual for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a reversal of performance fees of MOF II and SMAs for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was the result of a decline in the underlying fund values.\nOther Revenues and Fees. Other revenues and fees increased by $0.7 million, or 9%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in administrative fees from our permanent capital vehicles.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.0 million, or 4% to $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries, that resulted from an increase in headcount, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense, partly offset by a decrease in discretionary compensation during the year ended December 31, 2016\nPerformance Fee Compensation. There was a reversal in performance fee compensation of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a reversal of performance fee compensation of $8.0 million for the same period in 2015. The variance in performance fee compensation was due primarily to changes in projected future payments.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $11.7 million to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in expense support agreement expenses related to SIC. The expense support agreement with SIC expired on December 31, 2016, as such, we will no longer be responsible for expenses under the expense support agreement relating to SIC.\nOther Income (Expense)\nDividend Income. Dividend income increased by $0.4 million to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due to dividend income from our investment in available-for-sale securities which were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 9%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an acceleration of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount relating to prepayments made on our Term Loan Facility as a result of the refinancing of our indebtedness from the issuance of senior unsecured debt. Average debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $106.0 million and $105.9 million, respectively.\nOther Income (Expenses), net. Other expenses, net decreased by $0.6 million to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to changes in fair value of our investment in SIC.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 4.2% and 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as permanent differences and income allocated to non-controlling interests which is not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The increase in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributed to the variance in the reversal of performance compensation which is not included in taxable income as well as a New York City unincorporated business tax carryforward that was recorded during 2016.\nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interests and Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries\nNet income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries increased by $3.4 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to a reversal of MOF II performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015, a portion of which was allocated to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nRevenues\nManagement Fees. Total management fees increased by $14.4 million, or 24%, to $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our permanent capital vehicles generated an additional $12.4 million in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Management fees from SIC increased $12.7 million due to a 43% increase in fee earning AUM over that period and due to an increase in Part I incentive fees. Management fees from MCC decreased $0.2 million due to a decrease in Part I incentive fees, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in base management fees over that period.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Our management fees from long-dated private funds and SMAs increased by $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. As previously discussed, the adoption of new consolidation guidance led to the deconsolidation of our Consolidated Funds effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the deconsolidation, management fees increased by $4.5 million compared to the same period in 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in origination fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees decreased by $17.7 million to $(15.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to the reversal of MOF II performance fees as a result of a decrease in the asset values within the underlying MOF II portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $5.8 million in performance fees as a result of the deconsolidation of our Consolidated Funds for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nOther Revenues and Fees. Other revenues and fees decreased by $1.4 million, or 16%, to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to a $3.8 million decrease in reimbursements from SIC for organizational and offering expense. As of October 31, 2014, we were fully reimbursed by SIC, as such there was no revenue associated with these reimbursements during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in administrative fees from our permanent capital vehicles.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits increased by $6.4 million, or 32% to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due primarily to increases in base salaries, stock compensation incurred with the grant of restricted stock units in connection with the IPO of Medley Management Inc. and compensation associated with guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members that, prior to the Company's Reorganization and the IPO of Medley Management Inc., were recorded as distributions from members' capital. The increase in base salaries were primarily the result of a 20% increase in average headcount for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nPerformance Fee Compensation. Performance fee compensation decreased by $6.5 million to $(8.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The variance in performance fee compensation was due primarily to a decrease in our performance fee compensation payable that resulted from a decrease in projected future payments.\nConsolidated Funds Expenses. Consolidated Funds expenses decreased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There were no Consolidated Funds expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 3%, to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase in expense support agreement expenses related to SIC and an overall increase in general, administrative and other expenses due to an overall growth of our business. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in organization and offering expenses of SIC as a result of Medley not being liable for these expenses as of June 2, 2014.\nOther Income (Expense)\nWhen evaluating the changes in other income (expense), we separately analyze the returns generated by our investment portfolio from the investment returns generated by our Consolidated Funds.\nDividend Income. Dividend income of $0.9 million remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $2.9 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was a direct result of our $110.0 million debt refinancing with Credit Suisse AG Cayman Islands Branch. Average debt outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $105.9 million and $70.5 million, respectively.\nOther Income (Expenses), net. Other income (expenses), net decreased by $0.1 million to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease in expense associated with our revenue share payable and a decrease in loss from our investments in MOF I. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in unrealized loss from our investment in SIC.\nInvestments of Consolidated Funds\nInterest and other income of Consolidated Funds, excluding the amount attributable to loan participations, decreased by $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There were no Consolidated Funds expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet unrealized and realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds, excluding the amount attributable to loan participations, decreased by $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There was no unrealized or realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective income tax rate was 1.7% and 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to losses incurred by MOF I during the year ended December 31, 2013 for which there was no benefit taken as MOF I was not subject to New York City unincorporated business tax. The Company is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds decreased by $29.7 million to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same\nperiod in 2014. As a result of the deconsolidation of our Consolidated Funds effective January 1, 2015, we no longer record net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries decreased by $2.8 million to $(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reversal of performance fees of MOF II.\nReconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures to Consolidated U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also makes operating decisions and assesses business performance based on the financial and operating metrics and data that are presented without the impact of the consolidation of any funds. Management believes that these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding our underlying operating performance and our business, as they remove the impact of items management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. These non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. Additionally, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide another tool for investors to use in comparing our results with other companies in our industry, many of whom use similar non-GAAP measures. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and these measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below. Furthermore, such measures may be inconsistent with measures presented by other companies.\nNet income attributable to Medley LLC is the U.S. GAAP financial measure most comparable to Core Net Income and Core EBITDA.

As of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $49.6 million and our restricted cash equivalents balance was $4.9 million.\nOur material source of cash from our operations is management fees, which are collected quarterly. We primarily use cash flows from operations to pay compensation and benefits, general, administrative and other expenses, debt service costs and income and tax distributions to our members. Our cash flows, together with the proceeds from equity and debt issuances, are also used to fund investments in limited partnerships, purchase of available-for-sale securities, acquisition of fixed assets and other capital items. If cash flow from operations were insufficient to fund distributions, we expect that we would suspend paying such distributions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our consolidated financial statements reflect the cash flows of our operating business, and the results of our Consolidated Funds. The assets of our Consolidated Funds, on a gross basis, are significantly larger than the assets of our operating business and therefore have a substantial effect on our reported cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our Consolidated Funds include: (i) raising capital from third-party investors, which is reflected as non-controlling interests of our Consolidated Funds; (ii) purchasing and selling investment securities; (iii) collecting interest and dividend income; (iv) generating cash through the realization of certain investments; and (v) distributing cash to investors. Our Consolidated Funds are treated as investment companies for financial accounting purposes under U.S. GAAP; therefore, the character and classification of all Consolidated Fund transactions are presented as cash flows from operations.\nDebt Instruments\nSenior Unsecured Debt\n2026 Notes\nOn August 9, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $25.0 million of an aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d) at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount. On October 18, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $28.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes at a public offering price of $24.45 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. We used the net proceeds from these offerings to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility. Collectively, these offerings compose the senior unsecured debt balance as of December 31, 2016\nThe 2026 Notes mature on August 15, 2026 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on November 15, 2016. The 2026 Notes are subject to redemption in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at our option, on or after August 15, 2019 at a redemption price per security equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. The 2026 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLX.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2016, the outstanding senior unsecured debt balance was $49.8 million, which is reflected net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $3.8 million.\n2024 Notes\nOn January 18, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d) at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount of notes. On February 22, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes at a public offering price of $25.25 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes.\nThe 2024 Notes mature on January 30, 2024 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on April 30, 2017. The senior unsecured debt is subject to redemption in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at our option, on or after January 30, 2020 at a redemption price per security equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. The 2024 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLQ.\u201d\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn August 19, 2014, we entered into a $15.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with City National Bank (as amended, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent thereunder, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, which will mature on August 19, 2017, with a one-year extension at the option of the borrower, provided certain conditions are met. On May 3, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to permit us to issue additional indebtedness. The amendment also provided for the creation and funding of certain future funds, as well as for certain other technical changes to the Revolving Credit Facility. We intend to use any proceeds of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, including funding our working capital needs. We have not incurred any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility through the date of this filing.\nTerm Loan Facility\nOn August 14, 2014, we entered into a $110.0 million senior secured term loan credit facility (as amended, the Term Loan Facility\u201d) with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent thereunder, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as bookrunner and lead arranger, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, which was scheduled to mature on June 15, 2019. On May 3, 2016, the Term Loan Facility was amended to permit us to issue additional indebtedness with proceeds of such indebtedness to be used to prepay loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. The amendment also provided for the creation and funding of certain future funds, as well as for certain other technical changes to the Term Loan Facility. Medley LLC was the borrower under the Term Loan Facility.\nIn February 2017, borrowings under this facility were paid off using the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, without penalty, which resulted in the termination of the Term Loan Facility.\nInterest Rate and Fees\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (1) a Eurodollar margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate or (2) a base rate margin over an adjusted base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the term loan administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%; and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0%. The applicable margins for the Revolving Credit Facility are (i) if the ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA is less than 1.0 to 1.0, 1.5% in the case of adjusted base rate loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar loans, (x) 3.0% until maturity; and (ii) if the ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0, 2.50% in the case of adjusted base rate loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar loans, (x) 3.25% until maturity. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay an unused line fee of 0.25% per annum of the unused portion of the commitments.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) a Eurodollar margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate (with a floor\u201d of 1.0%) or (ii) a base rate margin over an adjusted base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the term loan administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%; and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0%. The applicable margins for the Term Loan Facility was 5.5%, in the case of Eurodollar loans and 4.5%, in the case of adjusted base rate loans.\nGuarantees and Collateral\nAny obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by certain of Medley LLC's subsidiaries, including Medley Capital LLC, MOF II Management LLC, MOF III Management LLC, Medley SMA Advisors LLC, Medley GP Holdings LLC, and Medley GP LLC (the credit agreement guarantors\u201d). In addition, any outstanding borrowings are collateralized by first priority or equivalent security interests in (i) all the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the borrower and each of the borrower's and credit agreement guarantors' direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each of the borrower's or any subsidiary guarantors' direct wholly owned first-tier restricted foreign subsidiaries, and (ii) certain tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and the credit agreement guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications).\nNone of our non-wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are obligated to guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility. Such subsidiaries include MCC Advisors LLC, SIC Advisors LLC, MOF II GP LLC and MOF III GP LLC.\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of significant affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. Such covenants, among other things, will limit or restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to:\nTable 228: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>incur additional indebtedness, make guarantees and enter into hedging arrangements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>create liens on assets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>enter into sale and leaseback transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in mergers or consolidations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make fundamental changes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 234: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>engage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make changes in the nature of their business; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>make prepayments of junior debt.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain, with respect to each four quarter period, a ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. The ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility is calculated using our financial results and includes the adjustments made to calculate Core EBITDA.\nOur Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lender under the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions,\nincluding the acceleration of any amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.\nNon-Recourse Promissory Notes\nIn April 2012, we borrowed $5.0 million under a non-recourse promissory note with a foundation, and $5.0 million under a non-recourse promissory note with a trust. Proceeds from the borrowings were used to purchase 1,108,033 shares of common stock of SIC, which were pledged as collateral for the obligations. Interest on the notes is paid monthly and is equal to the dividends received by us related to the pledged shares. We may prepay the notes in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The notes are scheduled to mature in March 2019. The proceeds from the notes were recorded net of issuance costs of $3.8 million and are being accrued, using the effective interest method, over the term of the non-recourse promissory notes.\nNotes Payable\nIn March 2014, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $2.5 million to a former Medley member in connection with the purchase of his membership interests. The promissory note carried no interest, had quarterly amortization payments of $0.3 million and matured in March 2016.\nCash Flows\nThe significant captions and amounts from our consolidated financial statements, which for the year ended December 31, 2014, include the effects of our Consolidated Funds in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are summarized below. Negative amounts represent a net outflow, or use of cash.\nTable 238: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of cash flows data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>15,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(196,202\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>(17,072\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(299\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(521\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>(15,256\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42,599\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>277,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(16,837\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(14,706\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities was $15.5 million, $28.2 million and $(196.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash flow provided by operating activities was due to net income of $10.6 million, $22.3 million and $70.1 million, respectively, non-cash adjustments of $6.5 million, $18.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(1.5) million, $(12.1) million and $5.9 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash flow used in operating activities also includes net purchases of investments by our Consolidated Funds, of $293.7 million and change in cash and cash equivalents of the Consolidated Funds of $22.2 million. These amounts represent the significant variances between net income and cash flows from operations and are reflected as operating activities pursuant to investment company accounting guidance. The growth of our business is reflected by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of our core segment, while the fund-related activities requirements vary based upon the specific investment activities being conducted during such period. The movements within our Consolidated Funds do not adversely impact our liquidity or earnings trends. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations provides us the necessary liquidity to manage short-term fluctuations in working capital as well as to meet our short-term commitments.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions of fixed assets, distributions received from our equity method investments and, in 2016, purchases of available-for-sale securities. Purchases of fixed assets were $1.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Distributions received from equity\nmethod investments were $1.7 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Purchases of available-for-sale securities were $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no purchases of available-for-sale securities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nFinancing Activities\nDistributions to members and redeemable non-controlling interests are presented as a use of cash from financing activities and were $30.0 million, $40.2 million and $120.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.. Capital contributions from non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests resulted in an inflow of cash of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Repurchases of LLC Units represented a use of cash from financing activities of $1.2 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOn August 9, 2016, we completed our first registered public offering of senior unsecured debt and on October 18, 2016 we completed our second registered public offering of senior unsecured debt. The proceeds from these offerings, net of offering expenses payable by us, amounted to $49.7 million. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility. Repayments of debt obligations resulted in an outflow of cash of $50.5 million, $1.3 million and $51.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of debt obligations provided an inflow of cash of $52.6 million and $123.9 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014, respectively. There were no proceeds from issuance of debt obligations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net contributions from non-controlling interests in our Consolidated Funds were $131.4 million and net proceeds from secured borrowings were $100.6 million. There was no impact on our cash flows relating to our Consolidated Funds for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nOn September 29, 2014, we completed the IPO of Medley Management Inc. pursuant to which we sold 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $18.00 per share. Total proceeds from the offering, net of offering expenses payable by us, were $96.7 million and were recorded as contributions from members.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nOur sources of liquidity are (i) cash on hand, (ii) net working capital, (iii) cash flows from operations, (iv) realizations on our investments, (v) net proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of publicly-registered debt and (vi) other potential financings. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments in the foreseeable future. We expect that our primary liquidity needs will be comprised of cash to (i) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing investment management business, (ii) fund our commitments to funds that we advise, (iii) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into business that are complementary to our existing investment management business, (iv) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees , (v) fund capital expenditures, (vi) pay income taxes, and (vii) make distributions to our unitholders.\nWe intend to use a portion of our available liquidity to fund cash distributions to our unitholders on a quarterly basis. Our ability to fund cash distributions to our unitholders is dependent on a myriad of factors, including among others: general economic and business conditions; our strategic plans and prospects; our business and investment opportunities; timing of capital calls by our funds in support of our commitments; our financial condition and operating results; working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs; contractual restrictions and obligations; legal, tax and regulatory restrictions; restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us; and other relevant factors.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nIn accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate those entities where we have a direct and indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. As such, we consolidate entities that we conclude are VIEs, for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity.\nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the consolidation analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We elected to early adopt this new guidance using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we determined that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of the funds. Therefore, we deconsolidated certain funds that had been previously consolidated under previous guidance effective January 1, 2015. Restatement of periods prior to January 1, 2015 was not required.\nFor legal entities evaluated for consolidation, we must determine whether the interests that it holds and fees paid to it qualify as a variable interest in an entity. This includes an evaluation of the management fees and performance fees paid to us when acting as a decision maker or service provider to the entity being evaluated. Under the new guidance, fees received by us that are customary and commensurate with the level of services provided, and we don't hold other economic interests in the entity that would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the expected losses or returns of the entity, would not be considered a variable interest. We factor in all economic interests including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if fees are considered a variable interest. Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance, these fees were considered variable interests by us.\nAn entity in which we hold a variable interest is a VIE if any one of the following conditions exist: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) the holders of equity investment at risk have the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the legal entity's economic performance, (c) the voting rights of some investors are disproportionate to their obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from a legal entity. Under the new guidance, for limited partnerships and other similar entities, non-controlling investors must have substantive rights to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner ( kick-out rights\u201d) in order to qualify as a VIE.\nFor those entities that qualify as a VIE, the primary beneficiary is generally defined as the party who has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. We are generally deemed to have a controlling financial interest if we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time we become initially involved with the VIE and we reconsider that conclusion continuously. The primary beneficiary evaluation is generally performed qualitatively on the basis of all facts and circumstances. However, quantitative information may also be considered in the analysis, as appropriate. These assessments require judgments. Each entity is assessed for consolidation on a case-by-case basis.\nFor those entities evaluated under the voting interest model, we consolidate the entity if we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity ( VOE\u201d) if we own a majority voting interest in the entity. Prior to the new guidance, we consolidated VOE's where we were the general partner and as such, were presumed to have control, regardless of our ownership.\nConsolidated Funds\nWith respect to the Consolidated Funds, which represent limited partnerships, Medley LLC earns a fixed management fee based on either (i) limited partners' capital commitments to the funds, (ii) invested capital, (iii) NAV, or (iv) lower of cost or market value of a fund's portfolio investments. In addition, Medley earns a performance fee based upon the investment returns in excess of a stated hurdle rate. We considered the accounting treatment under ASU 2010-10, Amendments for Certain Investment Funds, and determined that the funds were not VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2014. However, as the general partner, and due to the lack of substantive kick out or participating rights of the limited partners, these funds were consolidated under the voting interest model in accordance with ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDeconsolidated Funds\nCertain funds that have historically been consolidated in the financial statements are no longer consolidated. We had consolidated MOF I in our consolidated financial statements under the voting interest model in accordance with ASC 810-20, as we were the general partner and the limited partners lacked substantive kick out or participating rights. Effective January 1, 2015, we completed our role as investment manager of this fund and transitioned the management of the residual assets of this fund to another asset manager. As a result of this transition, we deconsolidated the financial statements of this fund, on January 1, 2015. There was no gain or loss recognized upon deconsolidation. In addition, on January 1, 2015, we deconsolidated the one remaining consolidated fund as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02.\nPerformance Fees\nPerformance fees are based on certain specific hurdle rates as defined in the funds' applicable investment management or partnership agreements. Performance fees are recorded on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are contractually due.\nWe have elected to adopt Method 2 of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, for revenue based on a formula. Under this method, we are entitled to performance-based fees that can amount to as much as 20.0% of a fund's profits, subject to certain hurdles. Performance-based fees are assessed as a percentage of the investment performance of the funds. The performance fee for any period is based upon an assumed liquidation of the fund's net assets on the reporting date, and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the fund 's income allocation provisions. The performance fees may be subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees recorded exceeds the amount due to the general partner or investment manager based on a fund's cumulative investment returns.\nPerformance fees receivable is presented separately in our audited consolidated statements of financial condition included in this Form 10-K and represents performance fees recognized but not yet collected. The timing of the payment of performance fees due to the general partner or investment manager varies depending on the terms of the applicable fund agreements.\nIf applicable, we record an accrual for the potential repayment of previously received performance fees which represents amounts that would need to be repaid to the underlying funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds' investments as of the reporting date. Our actual obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund's life.\nPerformance Fee Compensation Payable\nWe have an obligation to pay our professionals a portion of the performance fees earned from certain funds. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as performance fee compensation payable. Performance fee compensation is recognized in the same period that the related performance fees are recognized. Performance fee compensation can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and are therefore not subject to U.S. federal, sates and local corporate income taxes. We are subject to the New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions and other tax matters as a component of income tax expense. For interim periods, we account for income taxes based on its estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in its estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period they occur.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on us can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, we may engage in off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in guarantees, commitments, indemnifications and potential contingent repayment obligations.\nSee Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nTable 239: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4 - 5\nyears\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medley Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,263\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans payable (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Senior unsecured debt (3)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,595\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest obligations on debt (4)\n</td> <td>6,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,712\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue share payable\n</td> <td>1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital commitments to funds (5)\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>75,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>175,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________\nTable 240: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We lease office space in New York and San Francisco under non-cancelable lease agreements.

Holders of Medley LLC Units (other than Medley Management Inc.) may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions applicable to such members as set forth in the operating agreement of Medley LLC, from and after the first anniversary of the date of the completion of the IPO (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock of Medley Management Inc. on a one-for-one basis. Medley LLC intends to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the Code\u201d) effective for each taxable year in which an exchange of LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock occurs, which is expected to result in increases to the tax basis of the assets of Medley LLC at the time of an exchange of LLC Units. The exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Medley LLC. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that Medley Management Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the holders of LLC Units that provides for the payment by Medley Management Inc. to exchanging holders of LLC Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Medley Management Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of\nthese increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of Medley Management Inc. and not of Medley LLC. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of Medley Management Inc. (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that Medley Management Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of Medley LLC as a result of the exchanges and had Medley Management Inc. not entered into the tax receivable agreement. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income. See Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions - Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d described in our Prospectus. We anticipate that we will account for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the tax receivable agreement arising from future exchanges as follows:\nTable 245: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we will record an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the exchange;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>we will record 85% of the estimated realizable tax benefit (which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under the tax receivable agreement and the remaining 15% of the estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to additional paid-in capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAll of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the exchange will be included in net income. Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income.\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain indemnities for our affiliates, persons acting on our behalf or such affiliates and third parties. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the maximum exposure under these arrangements, if any, cannot be determined and has neither been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, we have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.\nContingent Obligations\nThe partnership documents governing our funds generally include a clawback provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to investors. Therefore, performance fee revenue, generally, is subject to reversal in the event that the funds incur future losses. These losses are limited to the extent of the cumulative performance fee revenue recognized in income to date, net of a portion of taxes paid. Due in part to our investment performance and the fact that our performance fee revenue is generally determined on a liquidation basis, as of December 31, 2016, we accrued $7.1 million for clawback obligations that would need to be paid had the funds been liquidated as of that date. There can be no assurance that we will not incur additional clawback obligations in the future. If all of the existing investments were valued at $0, the amount of cumulative performance fee revenue that have been recognized would be reversed. We believe that the possibility of all of the existing investments becoming worthless is remote. At December 31, 2016, had we assumed all existing investments were valued at $0, the net amount of performance fee revenue subject to additional reversal would have been approximately $7.1 million.\nPerformance fee revenue is also affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that we advise. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, bond yields and industry trading multiples. Under the governing agreements of certain of our funds, we may have to fund additional amounts on account of clawback obligations beyond what we received in performance fee compensation on account of distributions of performance fee payments made to current or former professionals from such funds if they do not fund their respective shares of such clawback obligations. We will generally retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations.\nAdditionally, at the end of the life of the funds, there could be a payment due to a fund by us if we have recognized more performance fee revenue than was ultimately earned. The general partner obligation amount, if any, will depend on final realized values of investments at the end of the life of the fund.", "item_7_truncated": "Total fee earning AUM increased by $243 million, or 8%, to $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to total fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2014 and was due primarily to increased commitments from SIC and SMAs.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, under U.S. GAAP, we were required to consolidate entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity, including affiliated funds, for which we are the general partner and are presumed to have control, and entities that we conclude are VIEs, for which we are deemed the primary beneficiary.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income on a standalone basis were greater than those presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP because certain revenues recognized from Consolidated Funds were eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, for that year, expenses on a standalone basis were lower than related amounts presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP due to the exclusion of the expenses of the Consolidated Funds.\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized Net Total Return(2):\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized Realized Losses on Invested Capital:\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Recovery(3):\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Long-Dated Private Funds\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Portfolio Internal Rate of Return(4):\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Investor Internal Rate of Return(7):\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annualized Realized Losses on Invested Capital:\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average Recovery(3):\n</td> <td>NM\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 engage in mergers or consolidations; \nTable 194: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Amounts in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee earning AUM based on gross asset value\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee earning AUM based on capital commitments\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fee earning AUM based on invested capital or NAV\n</td> <td>870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fee earning AUM\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe pre-IPO owners, are, subject to limited exceptions, prohibited from transferring any LLC Units held by them or any shares of Class A common stock received upon exchange of such LLC Units, until the third anniversary of the date of the closing of the IPO of Medley Management Inc. without the consent of the managing member.

Our ability to attract additional capital is dependent on investors' views of directly originated private credit investments relative to traditional assets. We believe fundraising efforts will continue to be impacted by certain fundamental asset management trends that include: (i) the increasing importance of directly originated private credit investment strategies for institutional investors; (ii) increasing demand for directly originated private credit investments from retail investors; (iii) recognition by the consultant channel, which serves endowment and pension fund investors, that directly originated private credit is an important component of asset allocation; (iv) increasing demand from insurance companies seeking alternatives to investing in the liquid credit markets; and (v) de-leveraging of the global banking system, bank consolidation and increased bank regulatory requirements. \nFinancing Activities\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) a Eurodollar margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate (with a floor\u201d of 1.0%) or (ii) a base rate margin over an adjusted base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the term loan administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%; and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0%.

For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income on a standalone basis were greater than those presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP because certain revenues recognized from Consolidated Funds were eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, during this period, expenses on a standalone basis were lower than related amounts presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP due to the exclusion of the expenses of the Consolidated Funds.\nOur calculations of fee earning AUM and AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by others.

Compensation includes salaries, discretionary bonuses, stock-based compensation and benefits paid and payable to our employees. Performance fee compensation is related to performance fees, generally consisting of incentive allocations in our long-dated private funds that we grant to certain of our professionals.

Part II incentive fees are payable annually and are calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (i) the sum of cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from (ii) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains. If the amount calculated is positive, then the Part II incentive fee for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of Part II incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then no Part II incentive fee will be payable for such year. As our investment strategy is focused on generating yield from senior secured credit, historically we have not generated Part II incentive fees.\nOn August 9, 2016, we completed our first registered public offering of senior unsecured debt and on October 18, 2016 we completed our second registered public offering of senior unsecured debt. The proceeds from these offerings, net of offering expenses payable by us, amounted to $49.7 million. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility. Repayments of debt obligations resulted in an outflow of cash of $50.5 million, $1.3 million and $51.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of debt obligations provided an inflow of cash of $52.6 million and $123.9 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014, respectively. There were no proceeds from issuance of debt obligations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nThe performance of MCOF and Aspect as of December 31, 2016 is not meaningful given the funds' limited operations and capital invested to date.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nAll of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the exchange will be included in net income.

With respect to long-dated private funds and SMAs, represents new commitments or gross inflows, respectively, as well as any increases in available undrawn borrowings. \nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the consolidation analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We elected to early adopt this new guidance using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we determined that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of the funds. Therefore, we deconsolidated certain funds that had been previously consolidated under previous guidance effective January 1, 2015. Restatement of periods prior to January 1, 2015 was not required.\nTax Receivable Agreement. Holders of Medley LLC Units (other than Medley Management Inc.) may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions applicable to such members as set forth in the operating agreement of Medley LLC, from and after the first anniversary of the date of the completion of the IPO (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock of Medley Management Inc. on a one-for-one basis. Medley LLC intends to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the Code\u201d) effective for each taxable year in which an exchange of LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock occurs, which is expected to result in increases to the tax basis of the assets of Medley LLC at the time of an exchange of LLC Units. The exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Medley LLC. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that Medley Management Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the holders of LLC Units that provides for the payment by Medley Management Inc. to exchanging holders of LLC Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Medley Management Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of\n \u2022 Our management fees from long-dated private funds and SMAs decreased by $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in origination fees, partly offset by an increase in base management fees. \nGenerally, if at the termination of a fund (and sometimes at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. Medley had not received any distributions of performance fees through December 31, 2016, other than tax distributions, a portion of which is subject to clawback. As of December 31, 2016, we accrued $7.1 million for clawback obligations that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Our actual obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund's life.\n \u2022 Our management fees from long-dated private funds and SMAs increased by $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. As previously discussed, the adoption of new consolidation guidance led to the deconsolidation of our Consolidated Funds effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the deconsolidation, management fees increased by $4.5 million compared to the same period in 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in origination fees. \nPerformance Fees\n (5) Pursuant to the Master Investment Agreement among Medley LLC, Medley Seed Funding I LLC, Medley Seed Funding II LLC, Medley Seed Funding III LLC, DB MED Investor I LLC and DB MED Investor II LLC, dated June 3, 2016, Medley LLC holds 100% of the outstanding Common Interest and DB MED Investor I LLC holds 100% of the outstanding Preferred Interest in this entity. \nWhen evaluating the changes in other income (expense), we separately analyze the returns generated by our investment portfolio from the investment returns generated by our Consolidated Funds.\n \u2022 Long-dated private funds and SMAs: MOF II, MOF III, MCOF, Aspect and SMAs, have a total AUM of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. \nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits generally includes salaries, discretionary bonuses and benefits paid and payable to our employees. Compensation also includes stock-based compensation associated with the grants of equity-based awards to our employees. Compensation expense relating to restricted stock units that are expected to vest are measured at fair value as of the grant date, and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nThe table below presents the roll forward of Fee Earning AUM.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits increased by $6.4 million, or 32% to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due primarily to increases in base salaries, stock compensation incurred with the grant of restricted stock units in connection with the IPO of Medley Management Inc. and compensation associated with guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members that, prior to the Company's Reorganization and the IPO of Medley Management Inc., were recorded as distributions from members' capital. The increase in base salaries were primarily the result of a 20% increase in average headcount for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nPerformance Fee Compensation. Performance fee compensation includes compensation related to performance fees, which generally consists of profit interests that we grant to our employees. Depending on the nature of each fund, the performance fee participation is generally structured as a fixed percentage or as an annual award. The liability is recorded subject to the vesting of the profit interests granted and is calculated based upon the net present value of the projected performance fees. Payments to profit interest holders are payable when the performance fees are paid to Medley LLC by the respective fund. It is possible that we may record performance fee compensation during a period in which we do not record any performance fee revenue or we have a reversal of previously recognized performance fee revenue. We have an obligation to pay our employees a portion of the performance fees earned from certain funds.\nOur net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities was $15.5 million, $28.2 million and $(196.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash flow provided by operating activities was due to net income of $10.6 million, $22.3 million and $70.1 million, respectively, non-cash adjustments of $6.5 million, $18.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(1.5) million, $(12.1) million and $5.9 million, respectively.\nCore Net Income Margin. Core Net Income Margin equals Core Net Income divided by total revenue, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, total standalone revenue.\nInterest and other income of Consolidated Funds, excluding the amount attributable to loan participations, decreased by $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There were no Consolidated Funds expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n (2) Represents a pro-forma adjustment for the amortization of stock based compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock units at the time of the IPO of Medley Management Inc. \n \u2022 Our ability to generate strong, stable returns and retain investor capital throughout market cycles. The capital we are able to attract and retain drives the growth of our AUM, fee earning AUM and management fees. We believe we are well positioned to invest through market cycles given our AUM is in either permanent capital vehicles or long-dated private funds and SMAs. \nTrends Affecting Our Business\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nManagement Fees. Total management fees increased by $14.4 million, or 24%, to $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nWe launched Medley Credit Opportunity Fund ( MCOF\u201d) in July 2016 to meet the current demand for equity capital solutions in the traditional corporate debt-backed collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) market. Its investment objective is to generate current income, and also to generate capital appreciation through investing in CLO equity, as well as, equity and junior debt tranches trading in the secondary market.\nManagement Fees. Total management fees decreased by $10.2 million, or 13%, to $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\n____________\n____________\n2024 Notes\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries decreased by $2.8 million to $(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reversal of performance fees of MOF II.\nIn connection with the initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of Medley Management Inc. on September 29, 2014, Medley LLC amended and restated its limited liability agreement to modify its capital structure by reclassifying the 23,333,333 interests held by the pre-IPO members into a single new class of units ( LLC Units\u201d). The pre-IPO members also entered into an exchange agreement under which they (or certain permitted transferees thereof) have the right, subject to the terms of the exchange agreement, to exchange their LLC Units for shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. In addition, pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability agreement, Medley Management Inc. became the sole managing member of Medley LLC.\n \u2022 Our management fees from permanent capital vehicles decreased by $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Management fees from SIC increased by $7.6 million due to an increase in Part I incentive fees and an 16% increase in average fee earning AUM for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Management fees from MCC decreased by $15.7 million due to a decrease in Part I incentive fees and a 14% decrease in average fee earning AUM for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. \n\nDirect origination, careful structuring and active monitoring of the loan portfolios we manage are important success factors in our business, which can be adversely affected by difficult market and political conditions, such as the turmoil in the global capital markets from 2007 to 2009. Since our inception in 2006, we have adhered to a disciplined investment process that employs these principles with the goal of delivering strong risk-adjusted investment returns while protecting investor capital. We believe that our ability to directly originate, structure and lead deals enables us to consistently lend at higher yields with better terms. In addition, the loans we manage generally have a contractual maturity of between three and seven years and are typically floating rate, which we believe positions our business well for rising interest rates.\nConsolidated Funds Expenses. Consolidated Funds expenses consist primarily of costs incurred by our Consolidated Funds during the year ended December 31, 2014, including professional fees, research expenses, trustee fees and other costs associated with administering these funds. These expenses are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and are allocated to non-controlling interests. As such, these expenses have no material impact on the net income attributable to Medley and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nRegistered Public Offering of Medley LLC Notes\nMedley Capital Corporation (MCC)\nTerm Loan Facility\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. To the extent it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is provided to offset their benefit.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions of fixed assets, distributions received from our equity method investments and, in 2016, purchases of available-for-sale securities. Purchases of fixed assets were $1.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Distributions received from equity\n (1) Annualized Net Total Return for SIC represents the annualized return assuming an investment at the initial public offering price, reinvestments of all dividends and distributions at prices obtained under SIC's dividend reinvestment plan and selling at the NAV as of the measurement date. \nWe launched SIC, our first public non-traded permanent capital vehicle, in April 2012. SIC primarily focuses on direct lending to middle market borrowers in the U.S. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 253 investments and have invested a total of $1.6 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM was $1.2 billion. The performance for SIC as of December 31, 2016 is summarized below:\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds relates to interest and dividend income generated from the underlying investments securities. Interest and other income are recognized on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. These sources of revenue are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and are allocated to non-controlling interests. As such, these sources of revenue have no direct material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions and other tax matters as a component of income tax expense. For interim periods, we account for income taxes based on its estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in its estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period they occur.\n \u2022 create liens on assets; \nOur effective income tax rate was 4.2% and 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as permanent differences and income allocated to non-controlling interests which is not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The increase in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributed to the variance in the reversal of performance compensation which is not included in taxable income as well as a New York City unincorporated business tax carryforward that was recorded during 2016.\n \u2022 the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund-level, including amounts subject to restrictions); and \n\nThe 2024 Notes mature on January 30, 2024 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on April 30, 2017. The senior unsecured debt is subject to redemption in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at our option, on or after January 30, 2020 at a redemption price per security equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. The 2024 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLQ.\u201d\nWe have elected to adopt Method 2 of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, for revenue based on a formula. Under this method, we are entitled to performance-based fees that can amount to as much as 20.0% of a fund's profits, subject to certain hurdles. Performance-based fees are assessed as a percentage of the investment performance of the funds. The performance fee for any period is based upon an assumed liquidation of the fund's net assets on the reporting date, and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the fund's income allocation provisions. The performance fees may be subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees recorded exceeds the amount due to the general partner or investment manager based on a fund's cumulative investment returns.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in Consolidated Funds that are consolidated in our financial statements.\nNotes Payable\nMOF II is a long-dated private investment fund that we launched in December 2010. MOF II lends to middle market private borrowers, with a focus on providing senior secured loans. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 68 investments and have invested a total of $903 million. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM was $409 million. MOF II is currently fully invested and actively managing its assets. The performance for MOF II as of December 31, 2016, is summarized below:\nInvestments of Consolidated Funds\nWith respect to the Consolidated Funds, which represent limited partnerships, Medley LLC earns a fixed management fee based on either (i) limited partners' capital commitments to the funds, (ii) invested capital, (iii) NAV, or (iv) lower of cost or market value of a fund's portfolio investments. In addition, Medley earns a performance fee based upon the investment returns in excess of a stated hurdle rate. We considered the accounting treatment under ASU 2010-10, Amendments for Certain Investment Funds, and determined that the funds were not VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2014. However, as the general partner, and due to the lack of substantive kick out or participating rights of the limited partners, these funds were consolidated under the voting interest model in accordance with ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nOur effective income tax rate was 1.7% and 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to losses incurred by MOF I during the year ended December 31, 2013 for which there was no benefit taken as MOF I was not subject to New York City unincorporated business tax. The Company is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nSeparately Managed Accounts (SMAs)\nNet income attributable to Medley LLC is the U.S. GAAP financial measure most comparable to Core Net Income and Core EBITDA. The following table is a reconciliation of net income attributable to Medley LLC on a consolidated basis to Core Net Income and Core EBITDA.\nOur senior management team has, on average, over 20 years of experience in credit, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. We have made significant investments in our corporate infrastructure and have over 85 employees, including over 45 investment, origination and credit management professionals, and over 40 operations, accounting, legal, compliance and marketing professionals, each with extensive experience in their respective disciplines.\nPerformance fee revenue is also affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that we advise. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, bond yields and industry trading multiples. Under the governing agreements of certain of our funds, we may have to fund additional amounts on account of clawback obligations beyond what we received in performance fee compensation on account of distributions of performance fee payments made to current or former professionals from such funds if they do not fund their respective shares of such clawback obligations. We will generally retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations.\nFee Earning AUM\nOther Income (Expenses), net. Other income (expenses), net decreased by $0.1 million to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease in expense associated with our revenue share payable and a decrease in loss from our investments in MOF I. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in unrealized loss from our investment in SIC.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $2.9 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was a direct result of our $110.0 million debt refinancing with Credit Suisse AG Cayman Islands Branch. Average debt outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $105.9 million and $70.5 million, respectively.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established.\nInterest Expense of Consolidated Funds. Interest expense of Consolidated Funds relates to interest and dividend income generated from the underlying investments securities attributable to the counterparty to the loan participations. Interest expense on secured borrowings of our Consolidated Funds is recognized on the same basis as the underlying interest and other income. As such, this interest expense has no direct material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\n (3) Represents a pro-forma adjustment to reflect guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members as compensation expense. Prior to the Company's Reorganization and IPO, these payments were recorded as distributions from members' capital. \nPerformance Fee Compensation. Performance fee compensation decreased by $6.5 million to $(8.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The variance in performance fee compensation was due primarily to a decrease in our performance fee compensation payable that resulted from a decrease in projected future payments.\nGuarantees and Collateral\nCertain funds that have historically been consolidated in the financial statements are no longer consolidated. We had consolidated MOF I in our consolidated financial statements under the voting interest model in accordance with ASC 810-20, as we were the general partner and the limited partners lacked substantive kick out or participating rights. Effective January 1, 2015, we completed our role as investment manager of this fund and transitioned the management of the residual assets of this fund to another asset manager. As a result of this transition, we deconsolidated the financial statements of this fund, on January 1, 2015. There was no gain or loss recognized upon deconsolidation. In addition, on January 1, 2015, we deconsolidated the one remaining consolidated fund as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02.\nThe partnership documents governing our funds generally include a clawback provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to investors. Therefore, performance fee revenue, generally, is subject to reversal in the event that the funds incur future losses. These losses are limited to the extent of the cumulative performance fee revenue recognized in income to date, net of a portion of taxes paid. Due in part to our investment performance and the fact that our performance fee revenue is generally determined on a liquidation basis, as of December 31, 2016, we accrued $7.1 million for clawback obligations that would need to be paid had the funds been liquidated as of that date. There can be no assurance that we will not incur additional clawback obligations in the future. If all of the existing investments were valued at $0, the amount of cumulative performance fee revenue that have been recognized would be reversed. We believe that the possibility of all of the existing investments becoming worthless is remote. At December 31, 2016, had we assumed all existing investments were valued at $0, the net amount of performance fee revenue subject to additional reversal would have been approximately $7.1 million.\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees increased to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a reversal of performance fees of $15.7 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was due to an increase in SMA performance fees accrual for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a reversal of performance fees of MOF II and SMAs for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was the result of a decline in the underlying fund values.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nAUM increased by $1.1 billion, or 30%, to $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to AUM as of December 31, 2014. Our permanent capital vehicles increased AUM by $293.0 million, or 13%, primarily associated with new equity issuances at SIC and increased leverage capacity at both MCC and SIC during the period. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs increased AUM by $804.3 million, or 56%, primarily associated with new capital commitments from our SMAs.\nThe following section sets forth historical performance for our active funds.\n \u2022 Permanent capital vehicles: MCC and SIC, have a total AUM of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock; \nWe are treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and are therefore not subject to U.S. federal, sates and local corporate income taxes. We are subject to the New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (3) Represents distributions of income, return of capital and return of portfolio investment capital to the fund. \nIn addition to these macroeconomic trends and market factors, our future performance is dependent on our ability to attract new capital. We believe the following factors will influence our future performance:\n \u2022 for our permanent capital vehicles, the average or total gross asset value, including assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage (see Fee earning AUM based on gross asset value\u201d in the Components of Fee Earning AUM\u201d table below for the amount of this component of fee earning AUM as of each period); \n____________\n \u2022 incur additional indebtedness, make guarantees and enter into hedging arrangements; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our consolidated financial statements reflect the cash flows of our operating business, and the results of our Consolidated Funds. The assets of our Consolidated Funds, on a gross basis, are significantly larger than the assets of our operating business and therefore have a substantial effect on our reported cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our Consolidated Funds include: (i) raising capital from third-party investors, which is reflected as non-controlling interests of our Consolidated Funds; (ii) purchasing and selling investment securities; (iii) collecting interest and dividend income; (iv) generating cash through the realization of certain investments; and (v) distributing cash to investors. Our Consolidated Funds are treated as investment companies for financial accounting purposes under U.S. GAAP; therefore, the character and classification of all Consolidated Fund transactions are presented as cash flows from operations.\nOther Revenues and Fees. Other revenues and fees increased by $0.7 million, or 9%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in administrative fees from our permanent capital vehicles.\n (4) Includes interest income, realized and unrealized gains (losses), fees and/or expenses. \nThe significant majority of our revenue is derived from management fees, which include base management fees earned on all of our investment products as well as Part I incentive fees earned from our permanent capital vehicles and from certain of our long-dated private funds. Our base management fees are generally calculated based upon fee earning assets and paid quarterly in cash. Our Part I incentive fees are typically calculated based upon net investment income, subject to a hurdle rate, and are also paid quarterly in cash.\nIn the normal course of business, we may engage in off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in guarantees, commitments, indemnifications and potential contingent repayment obligations.\n\nThe timing and amount of performance fees generated by our funds is uncertain. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods. Refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d\nOther Revenues and Fees. Other revenues and fees decreased by $1.4 million, or 16%, to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to a $3.8 million decrease in reimbursements from SIC for organizational and offering expense. As of October 31, 2014, we were fully reimbursed by SIC, as such there was no revenue associated with these reimbursements during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in administrative fees from our permanent capital vehicles.\nMedley LLC Reorganization\nIndemnifications\n \u2022 for certain funds within the investment period in the long-dated private funds, the amount of limited partner capital commitments (see Fee earning AUM based on capital commitments\u201d in the Components of Fee Earning AUM\u201d table below for the amount of this component of fee earning AUM as of each period); and \nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $11.7 million to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in expense support agreement expenses related to SIC. The expense support agreement with SIC expired on December 31, 2016, as such, we will no longer be responsible for expenses under the expense support agreement relating to SIC.\nProvision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes. We are treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and are therefore not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nTotal fee earning AUM decreased by $112.2 million, or 3%, to $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 compared to total fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2015, due primarily to distributions of income and return of capital by our long-dated private funds and SMAs as some of our vehicles are no longer in the investment period.\nthe investment management agreement at the discretion of the investor pursuant to the terms of the applicable documents. We manage assets for MCC and SIC, both of which are BDCs. The capital managed by MCC and SIC is permanently committed to these funds and cannot be redeemed by investors.\nWe recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit is recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n (5) Assumes that all our pre-tax earnings, including adjustments above, are subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes. In determining corporate income taxes, we used a combined effective corporate tax rate of 43.0% and presented the calculation as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u2022 Part I Incentive Fees. We also include Part I incentive fees that we receive from our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds in management fees. Part I incentive fees are paid quarterly, in cash, and are driven primarily by net interest income on senior secured loans. Effective January 1, 2016, as it relates to MCC, these fees are subject to netting against realized and unrealized losses. We are primarily an asset manager of yield-oriented products and our incentive fees are primarily derived from spread income rather than trading or capital gains. In addition, we also carefully manage interest rate risk. We are generally positioned to benefit from a raising rate environment, which should benefit fees paid to us from our vehicles and funds. \nOther Income (Expense)\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nOn January 18, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d) at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount of notes. On February 22, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes at a public offering price of $25.25 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 Gross asset values or NAV of such funds; \nIn April 2012, we borrowed $5.0 million under a non-recourse promissory note with a foundation, and $5.0 million under a non-recourse promissory note with a trust. Proceeds from the borrowings were used to purchase 1,108,033 shares of common stock of SIC, which were pledged as collateral for the obligations. Interest on the notes is paid monthly and is equal to the dividends received by us related to the pledged shares. We may prepay the notes in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The notes are scheduled to mature in March 2019. The proceeds from the notes were recorded net of issuance costs of $3.8 million and are being accrued, using the effective interest method, over the term of the non-recourse promissory notes.\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nDistributions to members and redeemable non-controlling interests are presented as a use of cash from financing activities and were $30.0 million, $40.2 million and $120.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.. Capital contributions from non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests resulted in an inflow of cash of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Repurchases of LLC Units represented a use of cash from financing activities of $1.2 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe launched Aspect-Medley Investment Platform A LP ( Aspect\u201d) in November 2016 to meet the current demand for equity capital solutions in the traditional corporate debt-backed collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) market. Its investment objective is to generate current income, and also to generate capital appreciation through investing in CLO equity, as well as, equity and junior debt tranches trading in the secondary market.\nCore Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Core EBITDA). Core EBITDA is an income measure also used by management to assess the performance of our business. Core EBITDA is calculated as Core Net Income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAn entity in which we hold a variable interest is a VIE if any one of the following conditions exist: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) the holders of equity investment at risk have the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the legal entity's economic performance, (c) the voting rights of some investors are disproportionate to their obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from a legal entity. Under the new guidance, for limited partnerships and other similar entities, non-controlling investors must have substantive rights to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner ( kick-out rights\u201d) in order to qualify as a VIE.\n (1) With respect to permanent capital vehicles, represents increases or temporary reductions during the period through equity and debt offerings, as well as any increases in capital commitments. With respect to long-dated private funds and SMAs, represents new commitments or gross inflows, respectively. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nDebt Instruments\nFor those entities evaluated under the voting interest model, we consolidate the entity if we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity ( VOE\u201d) if we own a majority voting interest in the entity. Prior to the new guidance, we consolidated VOE's where we were the general partner and as such, were presumed to have control, regardless of our ownership.\n (3) Strategic Capital Advisory Services, LLC owns 20% of SIC Advisors LLC and is entitled to receive distributions of up to 20% of the gross cash proceeds received by SIC Advisors LLC from the management and incentive fees payable by Sierra Income Corporation to SIC Advisors LLC, net of certain expenses, as well as 20% of the returns of the investments held at SIC Advisors LLC. \nFee earning AUM refers to assets under management on which we directly earn base management fees. We view fee earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn management fees. Our fee earning AUM is the\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also makes operating decisions and assesses business performance based on the financial and operating metrics and data that are presented without the impact of the consolidation of any funds. Management believes that these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding our underlying operating performance and our business, as they remove the impact of items management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. These non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. Additionally, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide another tool for investors to use in comparing our results with other companies in our industry, many of whom use similar non-GAAP measures. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and these measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below. Furthermore, such measures may be inconsistent with measures presented by other companies.\nCore Net Income. Core Net Income is an income measure that is used by management to assess the performance of our business through the removal of non-core items, as well as non-recurring expenses associated with the IPO of Medley Management Inc. It is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to Medley LLC to exclude reimbursable expenses associated with the launch of funds, amortization of stock-based compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock units at the time of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., other non-core items, the income tax impact of these adjustments and, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, adjustments to reverse the effect of the consolidation of Consolidated Funds.\nWe launched Medley SBIC in March 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of MCC. Medley SBIC lends to smaller middle market private borrowers that we otherwise would not target in our other funds, due primarily to size. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 31 investments and have invested a total of $330 million. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM was $237 million. The performance for Medley SBIC fund as of December 31, 2016 is summarized below:\nMedley LLC is a partially owned subsidiary of Medley Management Inc., a holding company whose sole asset is its controlling equity interest in Medley LLC. Medley Management Inc. owns 100% of the voting interests in Medley LLC and 19.93% of the issued and outstanding LLC Units of Medley LLC. The remaining LLC Units (80.07%) are held by the Senior Management Owners. The LLC Units do not have voting rights. Medley Management Inc. and the Senior Management Owners have also entered into an exchange agreement under which the Senior Management Owners (or certain permitted transferees) have the right (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), to exchange their equity interests in Medley LLC for shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications.\nRevenues\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain, with respect to each four quarter period, a ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. The ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility is calculated using our financial results and includes the adjustments made to calculate Core EBITDA.\nDividend Income. Dividend income consists of dividends associated with our equity method investment in SIC and our available-for-sale securities. Dividends are recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are declared and expected to be collected.\nContingent Obligations\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAUM increased by $555.2 million, or 12%, to $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 compared to AUM as of December 31, 2015. Our permanent capital vehicles remained consistent at $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs increased AUM by $575.1 million, or 26%, primarily associated with new capital commitments from our long-dated private funds and SMAs, partly offset by distributions by our long-dated private funds and SMAs as some of our vehicles are no longer in the investment period.\nOn August 19, 2014, we entered into a $15.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with City National Bank (as amended, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent thereunder, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, which will mature on August 19, 2017, with a one-year extension at the option of the borrower, provided certain conditions are met. On May 3, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to permit us to issue additional indebtedness. The amendment also provided for the creation and funding of certain future funds, as well as for certain other technical changes to the Revolving Credit Facility. We intend to use any proceeds of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, including funding our working capital needs. We have not incurred any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility through the date of this filing.\nThe consolidated financial statements of Medley have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, for the year ended December 31, 2014, our results of operations included the impact of our Consolidated Funds. Effective January 1, 2015, we deconsolidated our Consolidated Funds as a result of the early adoption of ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we consolidated funds where through our management contract and other interests we were deemed to have the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. As previously described, the consolidation of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds, but had no net effect on the net income attributable to our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nWe are an asset management firm offering yield solutions to retail and institutional investors. We focus on credit-related investment strategies, primarily originating senior secured loans to private middle market companies in the U.S. that have revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. We generally hold these loans to maturity. Our national direct origination franchise, with over 85 people, provides capital to the middle market in the U.S. Over the past 15 years, we have provided capital to over 350 companies across 35 industries in North America.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's standalone results to its consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n (4) For MOF II, SMAs and Medley SBIC, the Gross Portfolio Internal Rate of Return represents the cumulative investment performance from inception of each respective fund through December 31, 2016. The Gross Portfolio Internal Rate of Return includes both realized and unrealized investments and excludes the impact of base management fees, incentive fees and other fund related expenses. For realized investments, the investment returns were calculated based on the actual cash outflows and inflows for each respective investment and include all interest, principal and fee note repayments, dividends and transactions fees, if applicable. For unrealized investments, the investment returns were calculated based on the actual cash outflows and inflows for each respective investment and include all interest, principal and fee note repayments, dividends and transactions fees, if applicable. The investment return assumes that the remaining unrealized portion of the investment is realized at the investment's most recent fair value, as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There can be no assurance that the investments will be realized at these fair values and actual results may differ significantly. \nNet Income Margin is the U.S. GAAP financial measure most comparable to Core Net Income Margin. Net Income margin is equal to Net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC divided by total revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2014, total standalone revenue. The following table is a reconciliation of Net Income Margin to Core Net Income Margin.\nOther Revenues and Fees. We provide administrative services to certain of our vehicles that are reported as other revenues and fees. Such fees are recognized as revenue in the period that administrative services are rendered. These fees are generally based on expense reimbursements for the portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by certain professionals directly attributable to each respective fund. These fees are reported within total revenues in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n \u2022 make changes in the nature of their business; and \nIncome Taxes\nIn March 2014, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $2.5 million to a former Medley member in connection with the purchase of his membership interests. The promissory note carried no interest, had quarterly amortization payments of $0.3 million and matured in March 2016.\nWe have an obligation to pay our professionals a portion of the performance fees earned from certain funds. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as performance fee compensation payable. Performance fee compensation is recognized in the same period that the related performance fees are recognized. Performance fee compensation can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized.\nInvesting Activities\nOther Income (Expenses), Net. Other income (expenses), net consists primarily of expenses associated with our revenue share payable, equity income (loss) and unrealized gains (losses) associated with our equity method investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Depreciation (Appreciation) on Secured Borrowings of Consolidated Funds. Net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on secured borrowings of Consolidated Funds reflects both unrealized gains and losses from periodic changes in the fair value of these secured borrowings attributable to loan participations of our Consolidated Funds and the reversal upon repayments of these secured borrowings of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for these secured borrowings. The net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on secured borrowings of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the counterparty to the loan participations. As such, these unrealized gains and losses have no material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nPerformance fees receivable is presented separately in our audited consolidated statements of financial condition included in this Form 10-K and represents performance fees recognized but not yet collected. The timing of the payment of performance fees due to the general partner or investment manager varies depending on the terms of the applicable fund agreements.\nAUM refers to the assets of our funds. We view AUM as a metric to measure our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets generally at fair value plus available uncalled capital. For our funds, our AUM equals the sum of the following:\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.0 million, or 4% to $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries, that resulted from an increase in headcount, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense, partly offset by a decrease in discretionary compensation during the year ended December 31, 2016\n (3) Average Recovery includes only those realized investments in which we experience a loss of principal on a cumulative cash flow basis and is calculated by dividing the total actual cash inflows for each respective investment, including all interest, principal and fee note repayments, dividends and transactions fees, if applicable, by the total actual cash outflows for each respective investment. For MCC, MOF II and the SMAs, we have presented the Average Recovery as NM\u201d or Not Meaningful\u201d because we believe the number of realized losses for each respective vehicle is not sufficient to provide an accurate representation of the expected Average Recovery for each vehicle. \n (5) Earnings from Medley SBIC are paid to MCC. The Net Internal Rate of Return for Medley SBIC was calculated based upon i) the actual cash contribution and distributions to/from MCC and Medley SBIC ii) an allocable portion of MCC's management and incentive fees and general fund related expenses and iii) assumes the NAV as of the measurement date is distributed to MCC. As of December 31, 2016, Medley SBIC Net Internal Rate of Return as described above assuming only the inclusion of management fees was 21.0%. \nPerformance Fees. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs may have industry standard carried interest performance fee structures and are typically 15% to 20% of the total return over a 6.0% to 8.0% annualized preferred return. We record these fees on an accrual basis, to the extent such amounts are contractually due but not paid, and we present this revenue as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations. These fees are subject to repayment (clawback).\n \u2022 Part II Incentive Fees. For our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds, Part II incentive fees generally represent 20.0% of each fund's cumulative realized capital gains (net of realized capital \nTotal fee earning AUM increased by $1.0 billion, or 52%, to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 compared to total fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2013 and was due primarily to increased commitments from permanent capital vehicles.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash flow used in operating activities also includes net purchases of investments by our Consolidated Funds, of $293.7 million and change in cash and cash equivalents of the Consolidated Funds of $22.2 million. These amounts represent the significant variances between net income and cash flows from operations and are reflected as operating activities pursuant to investment company accounting guidance. The growth of our business is reflected by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of our core segment, while the fund-related activities requirements vary based upon the specific investment activities being conducted during such period. The movements within our Consolidated Funds do not adversely impact our liquidity or earnings trends. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations provides us the necessary liquidity to manage short-term fluctuations in working capital as well as to meet our short-term commitments.\nAUM increased by $1.4 billion, or 61%, to $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 compared to AUM as of December 31, 2013. Our permanent capital vehicles increased AUM by $974.9 million, or 76%, primarily associated with new equity issuances and increased leverage capacity at both MCC and SIC during the period. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs increased AUM by $424.4 million, or 42%, primarily associated with new capital commitments from our SMAs.\nMedley SBIC LP (Medley SBIC)\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments of Consolidated Funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds consists of realized gains and losses arising from dispositions of investments held by our Consolidated Funds. Substantially all of the net investment gains (losses) of our Consolidated Funds are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and allocated to non-controlling interests.\n (1) Net Income Margin equals Net income attributable to Medley LLC divided by total revenue and, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, total standalone revenue. \n (4) Represents equity commitments by us to certain long-dated private funds managed by us. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. \nOur material source of cash from our operations is management fees, which are collected quarterly. We primarily use cash flows from operations to pay compensation and benefits, general, administrative and other expenses, debt service costs and income and tax distributions to our members. Our cash flows, together with the proceeds from equity and debt issuances, are also used to fund investments in limited partnerships, purchase of available-for-sale securities, acquisition of fixed assets and other capital items. If cash flow from operations were insufficient to fund distributions, we expect that we would suspend paying such distributions.\n____________\nOther Income (Expense)\nHolders of equity interests in Medley LLC (other than Medley Management Inc.) were, subject to limited exceptions, prohibited from transferring any such equity interests that were held by them as of September 23, 2014 (the date of consummation of the IPO of Medley Management Inc.), or any shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock received upon exchange of such LLC equity interests, until September 23, 2017 without Medley Management Inc.'s consent. Thereafter and prior to September 23, 2018 and September 23, 2019, such holders may not transfer more than 33 1/3% and 66 2/3%, respectively, of the number of any shares of Medley LLC's equity interests held by them as of September 23, 2014, together with the number of any shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock received by them upon exchange therefor, without Medley Management Inc.'s consent. While this agreement could be amended or waived by Medley Management Inc., the holders of the equity interests in Medley LLC (other than Medley Management Inc.) have advised us that they do not intend to seek any waivers of these restrictions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n2026 Notes\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn August 9, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $25.0 million of an aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount. On October 18, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $28.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 at a public offering price of $24.45 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. The notes mature on August 15, 2026 and interest is payable quarterly. The notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at Medley's option on or after August 15, 2019 at a redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan Facility. The notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades thereon under the trading symbol MDLX.\u201d\n \u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates; \n (3) Our future interest obligations on debt outstanding assume an interest rate of 6.5% on our Term Loan balance and an interest of 6.875% on our senior unsecured debt balance. \nMedley Opportunity Fund III LP (MOF III)\n \u2022 The attractiveness of our product offering to investors. We believe defined contribution plans, retail investors, public institutional investors, pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies are increasing exposure to directly originated private credit investment products to seek differentiated returns and current yield. Our permanent capital vehicles and long-dated private funds and SMAs benefit from this demand by offering institutional and retail investors the ability to invest in our private credit investment strategy. We believe that the breadth, diversity and number of investment vehicles we offer allow us to maximize our reach with investors. \nGuaranteed payments made to our senior professionals who are members of Medley LLC are recognized as compensation expense. The guaranteed payments to our Co-Chief Executive Officers are performance based and periodically set subject to maximums based on our total assets under management. Such maximums aggregated to $5.0 million, $3.0 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, neither of our Co-Chief Executive Officers received any guaranteed payments.\n (2) If the pre-IPO owners exchanged all of their LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock, they would hold 80.07% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, entitling them to an equivalent percentage of economic interests and voting power in Medley Management Inc., Medley Group LLC would hold no voting power or economic interests in Medley Management Inc. and Medley Management Inc. would hold 100% of outstanding LLC Units and 100% of the voting power in Medley LLC. \nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in this Form 10-K.\nthese increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of Medley Management Inc. and not of Medley LLC. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of Medley Management Inc. (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that Medley Management Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of Medley LLC as a result of the exchanges and had Medley Management Inc. not entered into the tax receivable agreement. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income. See Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions - Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d described in our Prospectus. We anticipate that we will account for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the tax receivable agreement arising from future exchanges as follows:\n\nWe manage two permanent capital vehicles, both of which are BDCs, as well as long-dated private funds and SMAs, focusing on senior secured credit.\n \u2022 Base Management Fees. Base management fees are generally based on a defined percentage of (i) average or total gross assets, including assets acquired with leverage, (ii) total commitments, (iii) net invested capital, (iv) NAV or (v) lower of cost or market value of a fund's portfolio investments. These fees are calculated quarterly and are paid in cash in advance or in arrears depending on each specific fund. Base management fees are recognized as revenue in the period advisory services are rendered, subject to our assessment of collectability. \nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 3%, to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase in expense support agreement expenses related to SIC and an overall increase in general, administrative and other expenses due to an overall growth of our business. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in organization and offering expenses of SIC as a result of Medley not being liable for these expenses as of June 2, 2014.\nNon-Recourse Promissory Notes\nInterest Rate and Fees\nWe believe that our disciplined investment philosophy contributes to the stability of our firm's performance. Our results of operations, including the fair value of our AUM, are affected by a variety of factors, including conditions in the global financial markets as well as economic and political environments, particularly in the U.S.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 89%, 89% and 88%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from management fees and performance fees derived primarily from net interest income on senior secured loans.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 9%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an acceleration of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount relating to prepayments made on our Term Loan Facility as a result of the refinancing of our indebtedness from the issuance of senior unsecured debt. Average debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $106.0 million and $105.9 million, respectively.\n (1) We lease office space in New York and San Francisco under non-cancelable lease agreements. In August 2015, the Company signed a new lease for its office space in New York City. The Company's obligations under the current terms of these leases extend through September 2023. The amounts in this table represent the minimum lease payments required over the term of the lease, and include operating leases for office equipment. \nAs of December 31, 2016, the outstanding senior unsecured debt balance was $49.8 million, which is reflected net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $3.8 million.\n (6) Net Investor Internal Rate of Return for MOF II was calculated net of all management fees and carried interest allocation since inception and was computed based on the actual dates of capital contributions and the ending aggregate partners' capital at the end of the period. \nOur primary cash flow activities involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations, which largely includes management fees; (ii) making distributions to our owners; and (iii) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under our debt facilities. As of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $49.6 million and our restricted cash equivalents balance was $4.9 million.\nIn general, our institutional investors do not have the right to withdraw capital commitments and, to date, we have not experienced any withdrawals of capital commitments. For a description of the risk factor associated with capital commitments, see Risk Factors - Third-party investors in our private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.\u201d\nIn accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate those entities where we have a direct and indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. As such, we consolidate entities that we conclude are VIEs, for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had over $5.3 billion of AUM in two business development companies, MCC and SIC, as well as private investment vehicles. Our year over year AUM growth as of December 31, 2016 was 12% and was driven in large part by the growth of our long-dated private funds and SMAs. Our compounded annual AUM growth rate from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2016 was 32% and our compounded annual Fee Earning AUM growth rate of 23%, both of which have been driven in large part by the growth in our permanent capital vehicles. Since September 2015, we received over $1.5 billion of new institutional capital commitments, bringing AUM to over $5.3 billion. Typically the investment periods of our institutional commitments range from 18 to 24 months and we expect our Fee Earning AUM to increase as capital commitments included in AUM are invested.\nFor those entities that qualify as a VIE, the primary beneficiary is generally defined as the party who has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. We are generally deemed to have a controlling financial interest if we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time we become initially involved with the VIE and we reconsider that conclusion continuously. The primary beneficiary evaluation is generally performed qualitatively on the basis of all facts and circumstances. However, quantitative information may also be considered in the analysis, as appropriate. These assessments require judgments. Each entity is assessed for consolidation on a case-by-case basis.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nAs of December 31, 2016, fee earning AUM based on gross asset value decreased by $31.5 million, or 1%, compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease in fee earning AUM based on gross asset value was due primarily to a decrease at MCC that resulted from lower leverage capacity, a decline in portfolio asset valuations and share repurchases, partly offset by new equity issuances at SIC.\n \u2022 for the aforementioned funds beyond the investment period and certain managed accounts within their investment period, the amount of limited partner invested capital or the NAV of the fund (see Fee earning AUM based on invested capital or NAV\u201d in the Components of Fee Earning AUM\u201d table below for the amount of this component of fee earning AUM as of each period). \nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments of Consolidated Funds. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of Consolidated Funds reflects both unrealized gains and losses on investments from periodic changes in fair value of investments held by our Consolidated Funds and the reversal upon disposition of investments of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for those investments. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of Consolidated Funds is generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and allocated to non-controlling interests.\nDeconsolidated Funds\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net contributions from non-controlling interests in our Consolidated Funds were $131.4 million and net proceeds from secured borrowings were $100.6 million. There was no impact on our cash flows relating to our Consolidated Funds for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nReturns\nWe also generally earn performance fees from our long-dated private funds and SMAs. Typically, these performance fees are 15.0% to 20.0% of the total return above a hurdle rate. These performance fees are accrued quarterly and paid after return of all invested capital and an amount sufficient to achieve the hurdle rate of return.\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also makes operating decisions and assesses business performance based on the financial and operating metrics and data that are presented without the impact of consolidation of any funds. Core Net Income, Core EBITDA, Core Net Income Per Share and Core Net Income Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management to assess the performance of our business. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and these measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under \u2018\u2018- Results of Operations,'' which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, such measures may be inconsistent with measures presented by other companies. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP, see \u2018\u2018- Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures to Consolidated U.S. GAAP Financial Measures.''\nOn January 18, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2024 at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount of notes. On February 22, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes at a public offering price of $25.25 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. The notes mature on January 30, 2024 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on April 30, 2017. The notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at Medley's option on or after January 30, 2020 at a redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes. The notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLQ.\u201d\n____________\nPerformance Fee Compensation. There was a reversal in performance fee compensation of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a reversal of performance fee compensation of $8.0 million for the same period in 2015. The variance in performance fee compensation was due primarily to changes in projected future payments.\nConsolidated Funds\n \u2022 to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and \nReconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures to Consolidated U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\n (7) Medley GP Holdings LLC holds 96.5% of the Class B economic interests in each of MCOF GP LLC, and Medley (Aspect) GP LLC. \nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds decreased by $29.7 million to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same\n (3) With respect to permanent capital vehicles, represents distributions of income. With respect to long-dated private funds and SMAs, represents return of capital, given our funds' stage in their respective life cycle and the prioritization of capital distributions. \n (4) For year ended December 31, 2016, other non-core items consist of a $0.6 million acceleration of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount relating to prepayments made on our Term Loan Facility as a result of the refinancing of our indebtedness from the issuance of senior unsecured debt, a $0.5 million impairment loss on our investment in CK Pearl Fund and a $0.2 million severance cost to former employees. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, other non-core items consist of severance costs to former employees. \nCash Flows\nDividend Income. Dividend income increased by $0.4 million to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due to dividend income from our investment in available-for-sale securities which were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries increased by $3.4 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to a reversal of MOF II performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015, a portion of which was allocated to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDuring the first half of fiscal year 2016, economic conditions continued to be unpredictable and volatile as it was during fiscal year 2015. However, during the second half of fiscal year 2016, broad economic markets showed stability and loan volumes across the lending spectrum improved. Loan funds received significant inflows while CLO issuances continued to increase in the second half of 2016. Both these factors drove significant volume in the loan market and drove pricing lower. As a result, the opportunity set for appropriate risk-adjusted investments reduced. Our platform provides us the ability to lend across the capital structure and at varying interest rates providing our firm access to a larger borrower subset over time; however, we believe the deployment of capital during fiscal year 2016, was prudent and cautious in-light of the prevailing market conditions.\n \u2022 The strength of our investment process, operating platform and client servicing capabilities. Following the most recent financial crisis, investors in alternative investments, including those managed by us, have heightened their focus on matters such as manager due diligence, reporting transparency and compliance infrastructure. Since inception, we have invested heavily in our investment monitoring systems, compliance and enterprise risk management systems to proactively address investor expectations and the evolving regulatory landscape. We believe these investments in operating infrastructure will continue to support our growth in AUM. \nOn September 29, 2014, we completed the IPO of Medley Management Inc. pursuant to which we sold 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $18.00 per share. Total proceeds from the offering, net of offering expenses payable by us, were $96.7 million and were recorded as contributions from members.\n____________\n (7) Net Investor Internal Rate of Return for our SMAs was calculated using the Gross Portfolio Internal Rate of Return, as described in note 4, and includes the actual management fees, incentive fees and general fund related expenses. \n (1) Represents a pro-forma adjustment for the amortization of stock-based compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock units at the time of the IPO of Medley Management Inc. \n \u2022 Our permanent capital vehicles generated an additional $12.4 million in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Management fees from SIC increased $12.7 million due to a 43% increase in fee earning AUM over that period and due to an increase in Part I incentive fees. Management fees from MCC decreased $0.2 million due to a decrease in Part I incentive fees, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in base management fees over that period. \nSee Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nComponents of Fee Earning AUM\n\n\nThe significant captions and amounts from our consolidated financial statements, which for the year ended December 31, 2014, include the effects of our Consolidated Funds in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are summarized below. Negative amounts represent a net outflow, or use of cash.\nNet unrealized and realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds, excluding the amount attributable to loan participations, decreased by $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There was no unrealized or realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur sources of liquidity are (i) cash on hand, (ii) net working capital, (iii) cash flows from operations, (iv) realizations on our investments, (v) net proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of publicly-registered debt and (vi) other potential financings. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments in the foreseeable future. We expect that our primary liquidity needs will be comprised of cash to (i) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing investment management business, (ii) fund our commitments to funds that we advise, (iii) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into business that are complementary to our existing investment management business, (iv) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, (v) fund capital expenditures, (vi) pay income taxes, and (vii) make distributions to our unitholders.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense relating to debt incurred by us.\nMedley Group LLC, an entity wholly-owned by the pre-IPO owners, holds all 100 issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. For so long as the pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel hold at least 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units (excluding those LLC Units held by Medley Management Inc.), which we refer to as the Substantial Ownership Requirement,\u201d the Class B common stock entitles Medley Group LLC, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by it, to a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC that do not themselves hold shares of Class B common stock and entitle each other holder of Class B common stock, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by such other holder, to a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the number of LLC Units held by such holder. For purposes of calculating the Substantial Ownership Requirement, (1) shares of Class A common stock deliverable to the pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel pursuant to outstanding equity awards will be deemed then outstanding and (2) shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units held by any estate, trust, partnership or limited liability company or other similar entity of which any pre-IPO owner or then-current Medley personnel, or any immediate family member thereof, is a trustee, partner, member or similar party will be considered held by such pre-IPO owner or other then-current Medley personnel. From and after the time that the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer satisfied, the Class B common stock will entitle Medley Group LLC, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by it, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC that do not themselves hold shares of Class B common stock and entitle each other holder of Class B common stock, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by such other holder, to a number of votes that is equal to the number of LLC Units held by such holder. At the completion of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., the pre-IPO owners were comprised of all of the non-managing members of Medley LLC. However, Medley LLC may in the future admit additional non-managing members that would not constitute pre-IPO owners. If at any time the ratio at which LLC Units are exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock changes from one-for-one as set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the number of votes to which Class B common stockholders are entitled will be adjusted accordingly. Holders of shares of our Class B common stock will vote together with holders of our Class A common stock as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law.\nOverview\nOur Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lender under the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions,\n (2) Represents the permanent reduction in equity or leverage during the period. \nOur Structure\nResults of Operations\n (2) With respect to the year ended December 31, 2014, Core Net Income includes a pro-forma adjustment to reflect guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members as compensation expense. Prior to the Company's Reorganization and IPO these payments were recorded as distributions from members' capital. \nFor any given period, performance fee revenue on our consolidated statements of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not reverse previously recognized performance fees. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reversed $24.0 million of previously recognized performance fees. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reversed $4.4 million and $2.3 million of previously recognized performance fees on a standalone and consolidated basis, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized cumulative performance fees of $7.1 million.\nSierra Income Corporation (SIC)\nWe intend to use a portion of our available liquidity to fund cash distributions to our unitholders on a quarterly basis. Our ability to fund cash distributions to our unitholders is dependent on a myriad of factors, including among others: general economic and business conditions; our strategic plans and prospects; our business and investment opportunities; timing of capital calls by our funds in support of our commitments; our financial condition and operating results; working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs; contractual restrictions and obligations; legal, tax and regulatory restrictions; restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us; and other relevant factors.\nOn August 9, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $25.0 million of an aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d) at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount. On October 18, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $28.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes at a public offering price of $24.45 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. We used the net proceeds from these offerings to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility. Collectively, these offerings compose the senior unsecured debt balance as of December 31, 2016\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on us can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nManaging Business Performance\nNon-Controlling Interests\nlosses and unrealized capital depreciation). We have not received these fees historically, and do not expect such fees to be material in the future given our focus on senior secured lending.\n\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (1) a Eurodollar margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate or (2) a base rate margin over an adjusted base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the term loan administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%; and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0%. The applicable margins for the Revolving Credit Facility are (i) if the ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA is less than 1.0 to 1.0, 1.5% in the case of adjusted base rate loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar loans, (x) 3.0% until maturity; and (ii) if the ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0, 2.50% in the case of adjusted base rate loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar loans, (x) 3.25% until maturity. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay an unused line fee of 0.25% per annum of the unused portion of the commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nFor legal entities evaluated for consolidation, we must determine whether the interests that it holds and fees paid to it qualify as a variable interest in an entity. This includes an evaluation of the management fees and performance fees paid to us when acting as a decision maker or service provider to the entity being evaluated. Under the new guidance, fees received by us that are customary and commensurate with the level of services provided, and we don't hold other economic interests in the entity that would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the expected losses or returns of the entity, would not be considered a variable interest. We factor in all economic interests including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if fees are considered a variable interest. Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance, these fees were considered variable interests by us.\n\n\n \u2022 we will record 85% of the estimated realizable tax benefit (which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under the tax receivable agreement and the remaining 15% of the estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to additional paid-in capital. \nAs of December 31, 2016, fee earning AUM based on invested capital or NAV decreased by $80.7 million, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease in fee earning AUM based on invested capital or NAV was due primarily to distributions of income and return of capital by our long-dated private funds and SMAs as some of our vehicles are no longer in the investment period, partly offset by new capital commitments from our long-dated private funds and SMAs.", "item_7_text": "Total fee earning AUM increased by $243 million, or 8%, to $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to total fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2014 and was due primarily to increased commitments from SIC and SMAs.\nPrior to January 1, 2015, under U.S. GAAP, we were required to consolidate entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity, including affiliated funds, for which we are the general partner and are presumed to have control, and entities that we conclude are VIEs, for which we are deemed the primary beneficiary. See Critical Accounting Policies - Principles of Consolidation\u201d and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. We refer to standalone financial information\u201d or information presented on a standalone basis\u201d as information derived from our consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations for periods prior to January 1, 2015 that has been adjusted to eliminate the effects of the Consolidated Funds on our statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income on a standalone basis were greater than those presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP because certain revenues recognized from Consolidated Funds were eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, for that year, expenses on a standalone basis were lower than related amounts presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP due to the exclusion of the expenses of the Consolidated Funds.\nOther Long-Dated Private Funds\n \u2022 engage in mergers or consolidations; \nThe pre-IPO owners, are, subject to limited exceptions, prohibited from transferring any LLC Units held by them or any shares of Class A common stock received upon exchange of such LLC Units, until the third anniversary of the date of the closing of the IPO of Medley Management Inc. without the consent of the managing member. Thereafter and prior to the fourth and fifth anniversaries of the closing of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., such holders may not transfer more than 33 1/3% and 66 2/3%, respectively, of the number of LLC Units held by them, together with the number of any shares of Class A common stock received by them upon exchange therefor, without the consent of the managing member.\nIn addition, we also receive non asset-based management fees that may include special fees such as origination fees, transaction fees and similar fees paid to us in connection with portfolio investments of our funds. These fees are specific to particular transactions and the contractual terms of the portfolio investments, and are recognized when earned.\n \u2022 The extent to which investors favor directly originated private credit investments. Our ability to attract additional capital is dependent on investors' views of directly originated private credit investments relative to traditional assets. We believe fundraising efforts will continue to be impacted by certain fundamental asset management trends that include: (i) the increasing importance of directly originated private credit investment strategies for institutional investors; (ii) increasing demand for directly originated private credit investments from retail investors; (iii) recognition by the consultant channel, which serves endowment and pension fund investors, that directly originated private credit is an important component of asset allocation; (iv) increasing demand from insurance companies seeking alternatives to investing in the liquid credit markets; and (v) de-leveraging of the global banking system, bank consolidation and increased bank regulatory requirements. \nFinancing Activities\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bore interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (i) a Eurodollar margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate (with a floor\u201d of 1.0%) or (ii) a base rate margin over an adjusted base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the term loan administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%; and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0%. The applicable margins for the Term Loan Facility was 5.5%, in the case of Eurodollar loans and 4.5%, in the case of adjusted base rate loans.\nincluding the acceleration of any amounts due under the Revolving Credit Facility and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor.\nIn certain cases, the entities that receive management and incentive fees from our funds are owned by Medley LLC together with other persons. See Critical Accounting Policies\u201d and Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the manner in which management fees, performance fees and other fees are generated.\nDividend Income. Dividend income of $0.9 million remained consistent during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nMedley Opportunity Fund II LP (MOF II)\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees decreased by $17.7 million to $(15.7) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to the reversal of MOF II performance fees as a result of a decrease in the asset values within the underlying MOF II portfolio. The decrease was partially offset by an increase of $5.8 million in performance fees as a result of the deconsolidation of our Consolidated Funds for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nThe 2026 Notes mature on August 15, 2026 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on November 15, 2016. The 2026 Notes are subject to redemption in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at our option, on or after August 15, 2019 at a redemption price per security equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. The 2026 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLX.\u201d\n (3) We have included all loans described in Note 7, Senior Unsecured Debt,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. \nRevenues\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n (2) Represents a pro-forma adjustment to reflect guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members as compensation expense. Prior to the Company's Reorganization and IPO, these payments were recorded as distributions from members' capital. \n\n (2) We have included all loans described in Note 6, Loans Payable,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K. The amounts in this table include $44.8 million relating to our Term Loan Facility which was repaid in full in February 2017 using the proceeds from the issuance of additional senior unsecured debt. \nAdditionally, at the end of the life of the funds, there could be a payment due to a fund by us if we have recognized more performance fee revenue than was ultimately earned. The general partner obligation amount, if any, will depend on final realized values of investments at the end of the life of the fund.\nMOF III is a long-dated private investment fund that we launched in December 2014. MOF III lends to middle market private borrowers in the U.S., with a focus on providing senior secured loans. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 23 investments and have invested a total of $129 million. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM was $113 million. The performance for MOF III as of December 31, 2016 is not meaningful given the fund's limited operations and capital invested to date.\nAs of December 31, 2016, fee earning AUM based on capital commitments remained consistent compared to December 31, 2015.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nThe diagram below depicts our organizational structure (excluding those operating subsidiaries with no material operations or assets) as of March 15, 2017:\nManagement Fees. Management fees include both base management fees as well as Part I incentive fees.\nWe launched MCC, our first permanent capital vehicle in January 2011. MCC primarily focuses on direct lending to private middle market borrowers in the U.S. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 173 investments and have invested a total of $1.9 billion. As of December 31, 2016, excluding Medley SBIC LP, the fee earning AUM was $796 million. The performance for MCC as of December 31, 2016 is summarized below:\n (6) As of March 1, 2017, certain employees, former employees and former members of Medley LLC hold approximately 40% of the limited liability company interests in MOF II GP LLC, the entity that serves as general partner of MOF II, entitling the holders to share the performance fees earned from MOF II. \nOther Income (Expense)\n \u2022 we will record an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the exchange; \nOther Income (Expenses), net. Other expenses, net decreased by $0.6 million to $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was due primarily to changes in fair value of our investment in SIC.\n \u2022 make prepayments of junior debt. \nOn August 14, 2014, we entered into a $110.0 million senior secured term loan credit facility (as amended, the Term Loan Facility\u201d) with Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent thereunder, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, as bookrunner and lead arranger, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, which was scheduled to mature on June 15, 2019. On May 3, 2016, the Term Loan Facility was amended to permit us to issue additional indebtedness with proceeds of such indebtedness to be used to prepay loans outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. The amendment also provided for the creation and funding of certain future funds, as well as for certain other technical changes to the Term Loan Facility. Medley LLC was the borrower under the Term Loan Facility.\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts that contain indemnities for our affiliates, persons acting on our behalf or such affiliates and third parties. The terms of the indemnities vary from contract to contract and the maximum exposure under these arrangements, if any, cannot be determined and has neither been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, we have not had prior claims or losses pursuant to these contracts and expect the risk of loss to be remote.\n \u2022 make fundamental changes; \n____________\n \u2022 uncalled committed capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). \nIn February 2017, borrowings under this facility were paid off using the proceeds from the issuance of the 2024 Notes, without penalty, which resulted in the termination of the Term Loan Facility.\n \u2022 enter into sale and leaseback transactions; \nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General and administrative expenses include costs primarily related to professional services, office rent, depreciation and amortization, general insurance, recruiting, travel and related expenses, information technology, communication and information services, placement fees, SIC expenses under an investment advisory and expense support and reimbursement agreements and other general operating items.\nNone of our non-wholly owned domestic subsidiaries are obligated to guarantee the Revolving Credit Facility. Such subsidiaries include MCC Advisors LLC, SIC Advisors LLC, MOF II GP LLC and MOF III GP LLC.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Redeemable Non-Controlling Interests and Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. Net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in our consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe refer to standalone financial information\u201d or information presented on a standalone basis\u201d as information derived from our consolidated statements of operations for the period prior to January 1, 2015 that has been adjusted to eliminate the effects of the Consolidated Funds on our consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2014, revenues from management fees, performance fees and investment income on a standalone basis were greater than those presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP because certain revenues recognized from Consolidated Funds were eliminated in consolidation. Furthermore, during this period, expenses on a standalone basis were lower than related amounts presented on a consolidated basis in accordance with U.S. GAAP due to the exclusion of the expenses of the Consolidated Funds.\nOur calculations of fee earning AUM and AUM may differ from the calculations of other asset managers and, as a result, this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by others. In addition, our calculations of fee earning AUM and AUM may not be based on any definition of fee earning AUM or AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we advise.\nsum of all the individual fee earning assets of our funds that contribute directly to our management fees and generally equals the sum of:\n \u2022 Our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. Our ability to grow our revenue is dependent on our continued ability to source attractive investments and deploy the capital that we have raised. We believe that the current economic environment provides attractive investment opportunities. Our ability to identify attractive investments and execute on those investments is dependent on a number of factors, including the general macroeconomic environment, valuation, size and the liquidity of these investment opportunities. A significant decrease in the quality or quantity of investment opportunities in the directly originated private credit market, a substantial increase in corporate default rates, an increase in competition from new entrants providing capital to the private debt market and a decrease in recovery rates of directly originated private credit could adversely affect our ability to source investments with attractive risk-adjusted returns. \nOur private funds are closed-end funds, and accordingly do not permit investors to redeem their interests other than in limited circumstances that are beyond our control, such as instances in which retaining the limited partnership interest could cause the limited partner to violate a law, regulation or rule. In addition, SMAs for a single investor may allow such investor to terminate\n (2) Represents the permanent reduction in equity or leverage during the period. \n (4) Medley LLC holds 96.5% of the Class B economic interests in each of MCOF Management LLC, and Medley (Aspect) Management LLC. \nIn the case of our SMAs, the investor, rather than us, may control the assets or investment vehicle that holds or has custody of the related investments. Certain subsidiaries of Medley LLC serve as the investment adviser for our SMAs. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 116 investments and have invested a total of $705 million. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM in our SMAs was $420 million. The aggregate performance of our SMAs as of December 31, 2016, is summarized below:\n\n (3) For year ended December 31, 2016, other non-core items consist of a $0.6 million acceleration of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount relating to prepayments made on our Term Loan Facility as a result of the refinancing of our indebtedness from the issuance of senior unsecured debt, a $0.5 million impairment loss on our investment in CK Pearl Fund and a $0.2 million severance cost to former employees. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, other non-core items consist of severance costs to former employees. \nAny obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed by certain of Medley LLC's subsidiaries, including Medley Capital LLC, MOF II Management LLC, MOF III Management LLC, Medley SMA Advisors LLC, Medley GP Holdings LLC, and Medley GP LLC (the credit agreement guarantors\u201d). In addition, any outstanding borrowings are collateralized by first priority or equivalent security interests in (i) all the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, the borrower and each of the borrower's and credit agreement guarantors' direct or indirect domestic subsidiaries and 65% of the capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each of the borrower's or any subsidiary guarantors' direct wholly owned first-tier restricted foreign subsidiaries, and (ii) certain tangible and intangible assets of the borrower and the credit agreement guarantors (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications).\nOur primary expenses are compensation to our employees, performance fee compensation and general, administrative and other expenses. Compensation includes salaries, discretionary bonuses, stock-based compensation and benefits paid and payable to our employees. Performance fee compensation is related to performance fees, generally consisting of incentive allocations in our long-dated private funds that we grant to certain of our professionals. General and administrative expenses include costs primarily related to professional services, office rent and related expenses, expense support agreement expenses related to SIC, depreciation and amortization, travel and related expenses, information technology, communication and information services, placement fees and third-party marketing expenses and other general operating items.\nOperating Activities\n\n (1) The Class B common stock provides Medley Group LLC with a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC. From and after the time that the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer satisfied, the Class B common stock will provide Medley Group LLC with a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC that do not themselves hold shares of Class B common stock. \n (2) Annualized Net Total Return for MCC, including Medley SBIC, represents the annualized return assuming an investment at the initial public offering price, reinvestments of all dividends and distributions at prices obtained under MCC's dividend reinvestment plan and selling at NAV as of the measurement date. \nPerformance fees are based on certain specific hurdle rates as defined in the funds' applicable investment management or partnership agreements. Performance fees are recorded on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are contractually due.\nRedeemable Non-Controlling Interests and Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries\nIf applicable, we record an accrual for the potential repayment of previously received performance fees which represents amounts that would need to be repaid to the underlying funds if these funds were to be liquidated based on the current fair value of the underlying funds' investments as of the reporting date. Our actual obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund's life.\n____________\nAUM\n (1) Adjustments to Net income attributable to Medley LLC to calculate Core Net Income are presented as a percentage of total revenue, and, for the year ended December 31, 2014, total standalone revenue. \n\nPerformance Fee Compensation Payable\n (4) Includes interest income, realized and unrealized gains (losses), fees and/or expenses. \nmethod investments were $1.7 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Purchases of available-for-sale securities were $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. There were no purchases of available-for-sale securities for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nConsolidated Funds Expenses. Consolidated Funds expenses decreased by $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There were no Consolidated Funds expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nperiod in 2014. As a result of the deconsolidation of our Consolidated Funds effective January 1, 2015, we no longer record net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds.\nWhen we review our performance we focus on the indicators described below:\n \u2022 make investments, loans and advances, including acquisitions; \nThe Revolving Credit Facility contains a number of significant affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. Such covenants, among other things, will limit or restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the borrower and its restricted subsidiaries to:\nWe also receive incentive fees related to realized capital gains in our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds that we refer to as Part II incentive fees. Part II incentive fees are payable annually and are calculated at the end of each applicable year by subtracting (i) the sum of cumulative realized capital losses and unrealized capital depreciation from (ii) cumulative aggregate realized capital gains. If the amount calculated is positive, then the Part II incentive fee for such year is equal to 20% of such amount, less the aggregate amount of Part II incentive fees paid in all prior years. If such amount is negative, then no Part II incentive fee will be payable for such year. As our investment strategy is focused on generating yield from senior secured credit, historically we have not generated Part II incentive fees.\nOn August 9, 2016, we completed our first registered public offering of senior unsecured debt and on October 18, 2016 we completed our second registered public offering of senior unsecured debt. The proceeds from these offerings, net of offering expenses payable by us, amounted to $49.7 million. The net proceeds from the offering were used to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility. Repayments of debt obligations resulted in an outflow of cash of $50.5 million, $1.3 million and $51.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Proceeds from the issuance of debt obligations provided an inflow of cash of $52.6 million and $123.9 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2014, respectively. There were no proceeds from issuance of debt obligations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nThe performance of MCOF and Aspect as of December 31, 2016 is not meaningful given the funds' limited operations and capital invested to date.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nAll of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the exchange will be included in net income. Similarly, the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income.\nThe table below provides the roll forward of AUM.\n\n (1) With respect to permanent capital vehicles, represents increases during the period through equity and debt offerings, subject to restrictions, as well as any increases in available undrawn borrowings or capital commitments. With respect to long-dated private funds and SMAs, represents new commitments or gross inflows, respectively, as well as any increases in available undrawn borrowings. \nIn February 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which changes the consolidation analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. We elected to early adopt this new guidance using the modified retrospective method effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02, we determined that we are no longer the primary beneficiary of the funds. Therefore, we deconsolidated certain funds that had been previously consolidated under previous guidance effective January 1, 2015. Restatement of periods prior to January 1, 2015 was not required.\nTax Receivable Agreement. Holders of Medley LLC Units (other than Medley Management Inc.) may, subject to certain conditions and transfer restrictions applicable to such members as set forth in the operating agreement of Medley LLC, from and after the first anniversary of the date of the completion of the IPO (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), exchange their LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock of Medley Management Inc. on a one-for-one basis. Medley LLC intends to make an election under Section 754 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the regulations thereunder (the Code\u201d) effective for each taxable year in which an exchange of LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock occurs, which is expected to result in increases to the tax basis of the assets of Medley LLC at the time of an exchange of LLC Units. The exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of Medley LLC. These increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that Medley Management Inc. would otherwise be required to pay in the future. We have entered into a tax receivable agreement with the holders of LLC Units that provides for the payment by Medley Management Inc. to exchanging holders of LLC Units of 85% of the benefits, if any, that Medley Management Inc. is deemed to realize as a result of\n \u2022 Our management fees from long-dated private funds and SMAs decreased by $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in origination fees, partly offset by an increase in base management fees. \nGenerally, if at the termination of a fund (and sometimes at interim points in the life of a fund), the fund has not achieved investment returns that (in most cases) exceed the preferred return threshold or (in all cases) the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement, we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled. Medley had not received any distributions of performance fees through December 31, 2016, other than tax distributions, a portion of which is subject to clawback. As of December 31, 2016, we accrued $7.1 million for clawback obligations that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at fair value as of the end of the reporting period. Our actual obligation, however, would not become payable or realized until the end of a fund's life.\n \u2022 Our management fees from long-dated private funds and SMAs increased by $2.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. As previously discussed, the adoption of new consolidation guidance led to the deconsolidation of our Consolidated Funds effective January 1, 2015. As a result of the deconsolidation, management fees increased by $4.5 million compared to the same period in 2014. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in origination fees. \nPerformance Fees\n (5) Pursuant to the Master Investment Agreement among Medley LLC, Medley Seed Funding I LLC, Medley Seed Funding II LLC, Medley Seed Funding III LLC, DB MED Investor I LLC and DB MED Investor II LLC, dated June 3, 2016, Medley LLC holds 100% of the outstanding Common Interest and DB MED Investor I LLC holds 100% of the outstanding Preferred Interest in this entity. \nWhen evaluating the changes in other income (expense), we separately analyze the returns generated by our investment portfolio from the investment returns generated by our Consolidated Funds.\n \u2022 Long-dated private funds and SMAs: MOF II, MOF III, MCOF, Aspect and SMAs, have a total AUM of $2.8 billion as of December 31, 2016. \nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits generally includes salaries, discretionary bonuses and benefits paid and payable to our employees. Compensation also includes stock-based compensation associated with the grants of equity-based awards to our employees. Compensation expense relating to restricted stock units that are expected to vest are measured at fair value as of the grant date, and are expensed over the vesting period on a straight-line basis. Bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate.\nThe table below presents the roll forward of Fee Earning AUM.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits increased by $6.4 million, or 32% to $26.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due primarily to increases in base salaries, stock compensation incurred with the grant of restricted stock units in connection with the IPO of Medley Management Inc. and compensation associated with guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members that, prior to the Company's Reorganization and the IPO of Medley Management Inc., were recorded as distributions from members' capital. The increase in base salaries were primarily the result of a 20% increase in average headcount for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nPerformance Fee Compensation. Performance fee compensation includes compensation related to performance fees, which generally consists of profit interests that we grant to our employees. Depending on the nature of each fund, the performance fee participation is generally structured as a fixed percentage or as an annual award. The liability is recorded subject to the vesting of the profit interests granted and is calculated based upon the net present value of the projected performance fees. Payments to profit interest holders are payable when the performance fees are paid to Medley LLC by the respective fund. It is possible that we may record performance fee compensation during a period in which we do not record any performance fee revenue or we have a reversal of previously recognized performance fee revenue. We have an obligation to pay our employees a portion of the performance fees earned from certain funds.\nOur net cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities was $15.5 million, $28.2 million and $(196.2) million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net cash flow provided by operating activities was due to net income of $10.6 million, $22.3 million and $70.1 million, respectively, non-cash adjustments of $6.5 million, $18.0 million and $2.4 million, respectively, and changes in operating assets and liabilities of $(1.5) million, $(12.1) million and $5.9 million, respectively.\nCore Net Income Margin. Core Net Income Margin equals Core Net Income divided by total revenue, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, total standalone revenue.\nInterest and other income of Consolidated Funds, excluding the amount attributable to loan participations, decreased by $61.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There were no Consolidated Funds expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015.\n (2) Represents a pro-forma adjustment for the amortization of stock based compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock units at the time of the IPO of Medley Management Inc. \n \u2022 Our ability to generate strong, stable returns and retain investor capital throughout market cycles. The capital we are able to attract and retain drives the growth of our AUM, fee earning AUM and management fees. We believe we are well positioned to invest through market cycles given our AUM is in either permanent capital vehicles or long-dated private funds and SMAs. \nTrends Affecting Our Business\nComponents of Our Results of Operations\nManagement Fees. Total management fees increased by $14.4 million, or 24%, to $75.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nWe launched Medley Credit Opportunity Fund ( MCOF\u201d) in July 2016 to meet the current demand for equity capital solutions in the traditional corporate debt-backed collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) market. Its investment objective is to generate current income, and also to generate capital appreciation through investing in CLO equity, as well as, equity and junior debt tranches trading in the secondary market.\nManagement Fees. Total management fees decreased by $10.2 million, or 13%, to $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\n____________\n____________\n2024 Notes\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries decreased by $2.8 million to $(0.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was primarily due to the reversal of performance fees of MOF II.\nIn connection with the initial public offering ( IPO\u201d) of Medley Management Inc. on September 29, 2014, Medley LLC amended and restated its limited liability agreement to modify its capital structure by reclassifying the 23,333,333 interests held by the pre-IPO members into a single new class of units ( LLC Units\u201d). The pre-IPO members also entered into an exchange agreement under which they (or certain permitted transferees thereof) have the right, subject to the terms of the exchange agreement, to exchange their LLC Units for shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications. In addition, pursuant to the amended and restated limited liability agreement, Medley Management Inc. became the sole managing member of Medley LLC.\n \u2022 Our management fees from permanent capital vehicles decreased by $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Management fees from SIC increased by $7.6 million due to an increase in Part I incentive fees and an 16% increase in average fee earning AUM for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. Management fees from MCC decreased by $15.7 million due to a decrease in Part I incentive fees and a 14% decrease in average fee earning AUM for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. \n\nDirect origination, careful structuring and active monitoring of the loan portfolios we manage are important success factors in our business, which can be adversely affected by difficult market and political conditions, such as the turmoil in the global capital markets from 2007 to 2009. Since our inception in 2006, we have adhered to a disciplined investment process that employs these principles with the goal of delivering strong risk-adjusted investment returns while protecting investor capital. We believe that our ability to directly originate, structure and lead deals enables us to consistently lend at higher yields with better terms. In addition, the loans we manage generally have a contractual maturity of between three and seven years and are typically floating rate, which we believe positions our business well for rising interest rates.\nConsolidated Funds Expenses. Consolidated Funds expenses consist primarily of costs incurred by our Consolidated Funds during the year ended December 31, 2014, including professional fees, research expenses, trustee fees and other costs associated with administering these funds. These expenses are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and are allocated to non-controlling interests. As such, these expenses have no material impact on the net income attributable to Medley and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nRegistered Public Offering of Medley LLC Notes\nMedley Capital Corporation (MCC)\nTerm Loan Facility\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statements carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. To the extent it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be recognized, a valuation allowance is provided to offset their benefit.\nKey Performance Indicators\nOur investing activities generally reflect cash used for acquisitions of fixed assets, distributions received from our equity method investments and, in 2016, purchases of available-for-sale securities. Purchases of fixed assets were $1.9 million, $0.8 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Distributions received from equity\n (1) Annualized Net Total Return for SIC represents the annualized return assuming an investment at the initial public offering price, reinvestments of all dividends and distributions at prices obtained under SIC's dividend reinvestment plan and selling at the NAV as of the measurement date. \nWe launched SIC, our first public non-traded permanent capital vehicle, in April 2012. SIC primarily focuses on direct lending to middle market borrowers in the U.S. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 253 investments and have invested a total of $1.6 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM was $1.2 billion. The performance for SIC as of December 31, 2016 is summarized below:\nInterest and Other Income of Consolidated Funds. Interest and other income of Consolidated Funds relates to interest and dividend income generated from the underlying investments securities. Interest and other income are recognized on an accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected. These sources of revenue are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and are allocated to non-controlling interests. As such, these sources of revenue have no direct material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach, which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized. We also recognize a tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not\u201d that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits. Our policy is to recognize interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions and other tax matters as a component of income tax expense. For interim periods, we account for income taxes based on its estimate of the effective tax rate for the year. Discrete items and changes in its estimate of the annual effective tax rate are recorded in the period they occur.\n \u2022 create liens on assets; \nOur effective income tax rate was 4.2% and 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as permanent differences and income allocated to non-controlling interests which is not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The increase in the effective tax rate during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily attributed to the variance in the reversal of performance compensation which is not included in taxable income as well as a New York City unincorporated business tax carryforward that was recorded during 2016.\n \u2022 the drawn and undrawn debt (at the fund-level, including amounts subject to restrictions); and \n\nThe 2024 Notes mature on January 30, 2024 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on April 30, 2017. The senior unsecured debt is subject to redemption in whole or in part at any time or from time to time, at our option, on or after January 30, 2020 at a redemption price per security equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. The 2024 Notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLQ.\u201d\nWe have elected to adopt Method 2 of ASC 605, Revenue Recognition, for revenue based on a formula. Under this method, we are entitled to performance-based fees that can amount to as much as 20.0% of a fund's profits, subject to certain hurdles. Performance-based fees are assessed as a percentage of the investment performance of the funds. The performance fee for any period is based upon an assumed liquidation of the fund's net assets on the reporting date, and distribution of the net proceeds in accordance with the fund's income allocation provisions. The performance fees may be subject to reversal to the extent that the performance fees recorded exceeds the amount due to the general partner or investment manager based on a fund's cumulative investment returns.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds represents the ownership interests that third parties hold in Consolidated Funds that are consolidated in our financial statements.\nNotes Payable\nMOF II is a long-dated private investment fund that we launched in December 2010. MOF II lends to middle market private borrowers, with a focus on providing senior secured loans. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 68 investments and have invested a total of $903 million. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM was $409 million. MOF II is currently fully invested and actively managing its assets. The performance for MOF II as of December 31, 2016, is summarized below:\nInvestments of Consolidated Funds\nWith respect to the Consolidated Funds, which represent limited partnerships, Medley LLC earns a fixed management fee based on either (i) limited partners' capital commitments to the funds, (ii) invested capital, (iii) NAV, or (iv) lower of cost or market value of a fund's portfolio investments. In addition, Medley earns a performance fee based upon the investment returns in excess of a stated hurdle rate. We considered the accounting treatment under ASU 2010-10, Amendments for Certain Investment Funds, and determined that the funds were not VIEs for the year ended December 31, 2014. However, as the general partner, and due to the lack of substantive kick out or participating rights of the limited partners, these funds were consolidated under the voting interest model in accordance with ASC 810-20, Control of Partnerships and Similar Entities, for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth information relating to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2016.\nOur effective income tax rate was 1.7% and 2.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate was due primarily to losses incurred by MOF I during the year ended December 31, 2013 for which there was no benefit taken as MOF I was not subject to New York City unincorporated business tax. The Company is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and is therefore not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nSeparately Managed Accounts (SMAs)\nNet income attributable to Medley LLC is the U.S. GAAP financial measure most comparable to Core Net Income and Core EBITDA. The following table is a reconciliation of net income attributable to Medley LLC on a consolidated basis to Core Net Income and Core EBITDA.\nOur senior management team has, on average, over 20 years of experience in credit, including originating, underwriting, principal investing and loan structuring. We have made significant investments in our corporate infrastructure and have over 85 employees, including over 45 investment, origination and credit management professionals, and over 40 operations, accounting, legal, compliance and marketing professionals, each with extensive experience in their respective disciplines.\nPerformance fee revenue is also affected by changes in the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds that we advise. Valuations, on an unrealized basis, can be significantly affected by a variety of external factors including, but not limited to, bond yields and industry trading multiples. Under the governing agreements of certain of our funds, we may have to fund additional amounts on account of clawback obligations beyond what we received in performance fee compensation on account of distributions of performance fee payments made to current or former professionals from such funds if they do not fund their respective shares of such clawback obligations. We will generally retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations.\nFee Earning AUM\nOther Income (Expenses), net. Other income (expenses), net decreased by $0.1 million to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease in expense associated with our revenue share payable and a decrease in loss from our investments in MOF I. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in unrealized loss from our investment in SIC.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $2.9 million to $8.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was a direct result of our $110.0 million debt refinancing with Credit Suisse AG Cayman Islands Branch. Average debt outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $105.9 million and $70.5 million, respectively.\nWe analyze our tax filing positions in all of the U.S. federal, state and local tax jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns, as well as for all open tax years in these jurisdictions. If, based on this analysis, we determine that uncertainties in tax positions exist, a liability is established.\nInterest Expense of Consolidated Funds. Interest expense of Consolidated Funds relates to interest and dividend income generated from the underlying investments securities attributable to the counterparty to the loan participations. Interest expense on secured borrowings of our Consolidated Funds is recognized on the same basis as the underlying interest and other income. As such, this interest expense has no direct material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\n (3) Represents a pro-forma adjustment to reflect guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members as compensation expense. Prior to the Company's Reorganization and IPO, these payments were recorded as distributions from members' capital. \nPerformance Fee Compensation. Performance fee compensation decreased by $6.5 million to $(8.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The variance in performance fee compensation was due primarily to a decrease in our performance fee compensation payable that resulted from a decrease in projected future payments.\nGuarantees and Collateral\nCertain funds that have historically been consolidated in the financial statements are no longer consolidated. We had consolidated MOF I in our consolidated financial statements under the voting interest model in accordance with ASC 810-20, as we were the general partner and the limited partners lacked substantive kick out or participating rights. Effective January 1, 2015, we completed our role as investment manager of this fund and transitioned the management of the residual assets of this fund to another asset manager. As a result of this transition, we deconsolidated the financial statements of this fund, on January 1, 2015. There was no gain or loss recognized upon deconsolidation. In addition, on January 1, 2015, we deconsolidated the one remaining consolidated fund as a result of the adoption of ASU 2015-02.\nThe partnership documents governing our funds generally include a clawback provision that, if triggered, may give rise to a contingent obligation that may require the general partner to return amounts to the fund for distribution to investors. Therefore, performance fee revenue, generally, is subject to reversal in the event that the funds incur future losses. These losses are limited to the extent of the cumulative performance fee revenue recognized in income to date, net of a portion of taxes paid. Due in part to our investment performance and the fact that our performance fee revenue is generally determined on a liquidation basis, as of December 31, 2016, we accrued $7.1 million for clawback obligations that would need to be paid had the funds been liquidated as of that date. There can be no assurance that we will not incur additional clawback obligations in the future. If all of the existing investments were valued at $0, the amount of cumulative performance fee revenue that have been recognized would be reversed. We believe that the possibility of all of the existing investments becoming worthless is remote. At December 31, 2016, had we assumed all existing investments were valued at $0, the net amount of performance fee revenue subject to additional reversal would have been approximately $7.1 million.\nPerformance Fees. Performance fees increased to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a reversal of performance fees of $15.7 million for the same period in 2015. The increase was due to an increase in SMA performance fees accrual for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a reversal of performance fees of MOF II and SMAs for the year ended December 31, 2015, which was the result of a decline in the underlying fund values.\nSources and Uses of Liquidity\nAUM increased by $1.1 billion, or 30%, to $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2015 compared to AUM as of December 31, 2014. Our permanent capital vehicles increased AUM by $293.0 million, or 13%, primarily associated with new equity issuances at SIC and increased leverage capacity at both MCC and SIC during the period. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs increased AUM by $804.3 million, or 56%, primarily associated with new capital commitments from our SMAs.\nThe following section sets forth historical performance for our active funds.\n \u2022 Permanent capital vehicles: MCC and SIC, have a total AUM of $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. \n \u2022 pay dividends and distributions or repurchase our capital stock; \nWe are treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and are therefore not subject to U.S. federal, sates and local corporate income taxes. We are subject to the New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n (3) Represents distributions of income, return of capital and return of portfolio investment capital to the fund. \nIn addition to these macroeconomic trends and market factors, our future performance is dependent on our ability to attract new capital. We believe the following factors will influence our future performance:\n \u2022 for our permanent capital vehicles, the average or total gross asset value, including assets acquired with the proceeds of leverage (see Fee earning AUM based on gross asset value\u201d in the Components of Fee Earning AUM\u201d table below for the amount of this component of fee earning AUM as of each period); \n____________\n \u2022 incur additional indebtedness, make guarantees and enter into hedging arrangements; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, our consolidated financial statements reflect the cash flows of our operating business, and the results of our Consolidated Funds. The assets of our Consolidated Funds, on a gross basis, are significantly larger than the assets of our operating business and therefore have a substantial effect on our reported cash flows. The primary cash flow activities of our Consolidated Funds include: (i) raising capital from third-party investors, which is reflected as non-controlling interests of our Consolidated Funds; (ii) purchasing and selling investment securities; (iii) collecting interest and dividend income; (iv) generating cash through the realization of certain investments; and (v) distributing cash to investors. Our Consolidated Funds are treated as investment companies for financial accounting purposes under U.S. GAAP; therefore, the character and classification of all Consolidated Fund transactions are presented as cash flows from operations.\nOther Revenues and Fees. Other revenues and fees increased by $0.7 million, or 9%, to $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in administrative fees from our permanent capital vehicles.\n (4) Includes interest income, realized and unrealized gains (losses), fees and/or expenses. \nThe significant majority of our revenue is derived from management fees, which include base management fees earned on all of our investment products as well as Part I incentive fees earned from our permanent capital vehicles and from certain of our long-dated private funds. Our base management fees are generally calculated based upon fee earning assets and paid quarterly in cash. Our Part I incentive fees are typically calculated based upon net investment income, subject to a hurdle rate, and are also paid quarterly in cash.\nIn the normal course of business, we may engage in off-balance sheet arrangements, including transactions in guarantees, commitments, indemnifications and potential contingent repayment obligations.\n\nThe timing and amount of performance fees generated by our funds is uncertain. If we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter or year, it may have a significant impact on our results for that particular quarter or year that may not be replicated in subsequent periods. Refer to Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business and Industry.\u201d\nOther Revenues and Fees. Other revenues and fees decreased by $1.4 million, or 16%, to $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The decrease was due primarily to a $3.8 million decrease in reimbursements from SIC for organizational and offering expense. As of October 31, 2014, we were fully reimbursed by SIC, as such there was no revenue associated with these reimbursements during the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was partially offset by an increase in administrative fees from our permanent capital vehicles.\nMedley LLC Reorganization\nIndemnifications\n \u2022 for certain funds within the investment period in the long-dated private funds, the amount of limited partner capital commitments (see Fee earning AUM based on capital commitments\u201d in the Components of Fee Earning AUM\u201d table below for the amount of this component of fee earning AUM as of each period); and \nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $11.7 million to $28.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in expense support agreement expenses related to SIC. The expense support agreement with SIC expired on December 31, 2016, as such, we will no longer be responsible for expenses under the expense support agreement relating to SIC.\nProvision for (Benefit From) Income Taxes. We are treated as a partnership for income tax purposes and are therefore not subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. The Company is subject to New York City unincorporated business tax attributable to taxable income allocable to New York City.\nTotal fee earning AUM decreased by $112.2 million, or 3%, to $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2016 compared to total fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2015, due primarily to distributions of income and return of capital by our long-dated private funds and SMAs as some of our vehicles are no longer in the investment period.\nthe investment management agreement at the discretion of the investor pursuant to the terms of the applicable documents. We manage assets for MCC and SIC, both of which are BDCs. The capital managed by MCC and SIC is permanently committed to these funds and cannot be redeemed by investors.\nWe recognize the benefit of an income tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon tax examination, based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Otherwise, no benefit is recognized. The tax benefits recognized are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Interest expense and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes.\n (5) Assumes that all our pre-tax earnings, including adjustments above, are subject to federal, state and local corporate income taxes. In determining corporate income taxes, we used a combined effective corporate tax rate of 43.0% and presented the calculation as a percentage of total revenue. \n \u2022 Part I Incentive Fees. We also include Part I incentive fees that we receive from our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds in management fees. Part I incentive fees are paid quarterly, in cash, and are driven primarily by net interest income on senior secured loans. Effective January 1, 2016, as it relates to MCC, these fees are subject to netting against realized and unrealized losses. We are primarily an asset manager of yield-oriented products and our incentive fees are primarily derived from spread income rather than trading or capital gains. In addition, we also carefully manage interest rate risk. We are generally positioned to benefit from a raising rate environment, which should benefit fees paid to us from our vehicles and funds. \nOther Income (Expense)\nNon-GAAP Financial Information\nOn January 18, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2024 (the 2024 Notes\u201d) at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount of notes. On February 22, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes at a public offering price of $25.25 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes.\n \u2022 Gross asset values or NAV of such funds; \nIn April 2012, we borrowed $5.0 million under a non-recourse promissory note with a foundation, and $5.0 million under a non-recourse promissory note with a trust. Proceeds from the borrowings were used to purchase 1,108,033 shares of common stock of SIC, which were pledged as collateral for the obligations. Interest on the notes is paid monthly and is equal to the dividends received by us related to the pledged shares. We may prepay the notes in whole or in part at any time without penalty. The notes are scheduled to mature in March 2019. The proceeds from the notes were recorded net of issuance costs of $3.8 million and are being accrued, using the effective interest method, over the term of the non-recourse promissory notes.\nThe following table and discussion sets forth information regarding our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.\nDistributions to members and redeemable non-controlling interests are presented as a use of cash from financing activities and were $30.0 million, $40.2 million and $120.8 million, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.. Capital contributions from non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests resulted in an inflow of cash of $17.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Repurchases of LLC Units represented a use of cash from financing activities of $1.2 million and $0.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe launched Aspect-Medley Investment Platform A LP ( Aspect\u201d) in November 2016 to meet the current demand for equity capital solutions in the traditional corporate debt-backed collateralized loan obligation ( CLO\u201d) market. Its investment objective is to generate current income, and also to generate capital appreciation through investing in CLO equity, as well as, equity and junior debt tranches trading in the secondary market.\nCore Earnings Before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (Core EBITDA). Core EBITDA is an income measure also used by management to assess the performance of our business. Core EBITDA is calculated as Core Net Income before interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAn entity in which we hold a variable interest is a VIE if any one of the following conditions exist: (a) the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the legal entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support, (b) the holders of equity investment at risk have the right to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the legal entity's economic performance, (c) the voting rights of some investors are disproportionate to their obligation to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from a legal entity. Under the new guidance, for limited partnerships and other similar entities, non-controlling investors must have substantive rights to either dissolve the fund or remove the general partner ( kick-out rights\u201d) in order to qualify as a VIE.\n (1) With respect to permanent capital vehicles, represents increases or temporary reductions during the period through equity and debt offerings, as well as any increases in capital commitments. With respect to long-dated private funds and SMAs, represents new commitments or gross inflows, respectively. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nDebt Instruments\nFor those entities evaluated under the voting interest model, we consolidate the entity if we have a controlling financial interest. We have a controlling financial interest in a voting interest entity ( VOE\u201d) if we own a majority voting interest in the entity. Prior to the new guidance, we consolidated VOE's where we were the general partner and as such, were presumed to have control, regardless of our ownership.\n (3) Strategic Capital Advisory Services, LLC owns 20% of SIC Advisors LLC and is entitled to receive distributions of up to 20% of the gross cash proceeds received by SIC Advisors LLC from the management and incentive fees payable by Sierra Income Corporation to SIC Advisors LLC, net of certain expenses, as well as 20% of the returns of the investments held at SIC Advisors LLC. \nFee earning AUM refers to assets under management on which we directly earn base management fees. We view fee earning AUM as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn management fees. Our fee earning AUM is the\nProvision for Income Taxes\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also makes operating decisions and assesses business performance based on the financial and operating metrics and data that are presented without the impact of the consolidation of any funds. Management believes that these measures provide analysts, investors and management with helpful information regarding our underlying operating performance and our business, as they remove the impact of items management believes are not reflective of underlying operating performance. These non-GAAP measures are also used by management for planning purposes, including the preparation of internal budgets; and for evaluating the effectiveness of operational strategies. Additionally, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide another tool for investors to use in comparing our results with other companies in our industry, many of whom use similar non-GAAP measures. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and these measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed below. Furthermore, such measures may be inconsistent with measures presented by other companies.\nCore Net Income. Core Net Income is an income measure that is used by management to assess the performance of our business through the removal of non-core items, as well as non-recurring expenses associated with the IPO of Medley Management Inc. It is calculated by adjusting net income attributable to Medley LLC to exclude reimbursable expenses associated with the launch of funds, amortization of stock-based compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock units at the time of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., other non-core items, the income tax impact of these adjustments and, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, adjustments to reverse the effect of the consolidation of Consolidated Funds.\nWe launched Medley SBIC in March 2013 as a wholly owned subsidiary of MCC. Medley SBIC lends to smaller middle market private borrowers that we otherwise would not target in our other funds, due primarily to size. Since inception, we have provided capital for a total of 31 investments and have invested a total of $330 million. As of December 31, 2016, the fee earning AUM was $237 million. The performance for Medley SBIC fund as of December 31, 2016 is summarized below:\nMedley LLC is a partially owned subsidiary of Medley Management Inc., a holding company whose sole asset is its controlling equity interest in Medley LLC. Medley Management Inc. owns 100% of the voting interests in Medley LLC and 19.93% of the issued and outstanding LLC Units of Medley LLC. The remaining LLC Units (80.07%) are held by the Senior Management Owners. The LLC Units do not have voting rights. Medley Management Inc. and the Senior Management Owners have also entered into an exchange agreement under which the Senior Management Owners (or certain permitted transferees) have the right (subject to the terms of the exchange agreement), to exchange their equity interests in Medley LLC for shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications.\nRevenues\nIn addition, the credit agreement governing our Revolving Credit Facility contains a financial covenant that requires us to maintain, with respect to each four quarter period, a ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA not greater than 3.5 to 1.0. The ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA in respect of the Revolving Credit Facility is calculated using our financial results and includes the adjustments made to calculate Core EBITDA.\nDividend Income. Dividend income consists of dividends associated with our equity method investment in SIC and our available-for-sale securities. Dividends are recognized on an accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are declared and expected to be collected.\nContingent Obligations\nProvision for Income Taxes\nAUM increased by $555.2 million, or 12%, to $5.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 compared to AUM as of December 31, 2015. Our permanent capital vehicles remained consistent at $2.5 billion as of December 31, 2016. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs increased AUM by $575.1 million, or 26%, primarily associated with new capital commitments from our long-dated private funds and SMAs, partly offset by distributions by our long-dated private funds and SMAs as some of our vehicles are no longer in the investment period.\nOn August 19, 2014, we entered into a $15.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility with City National Bank (as amended, the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent thereunder, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, which will mature on August 19, 2017, with a one-year extension at the option of the borrower, provided certain conditions are met. On May 3, 2016, the Revolving Credit Facility was amended to permit us to issue additional indebtedness. The amendment also provided for the creation and funding of certain future funds, as well as for certain other technical changes to the Revolving Credit Facility. We intend to use any proceeds of borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility for general corporate purposes, including funding our working capital needs. We have not incurred any borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility through the date of this filing.\nThe consolidated financial statements of Medley have been prepared on substantially the same basis for all historical periods presented; however, for the year ended December 31, 2014, our results of operations included the impact of our Consolidated Funds. Effective January 1, 2015, we deconsolidated our Consolidated Funds as a result of the early adoption of ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810) - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we consolidated funds where through our management contract and other interests we were deemed to have the power, through voting or similar rights, to direct the activities of the legal entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. As previously described, the consolidation of these funds had the impact of increasing interest and other income of Consolidated Funds, interest and other expenses of Consolidated Funds and net investment gains (losses) of Consolidated Funds, but had no net effect on the net income attributable to our consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExpenses\nWe are an asset management firm offering yield solutions to retail and institutional investors. We focus on credit-related investment strategies, primarily originating senior secured loans to private middle market companies in the U.S. that have revenues between $50 million and $1 billion. We generally hold these loans to maturity. Our national direct origination franchise, with over 85 people, provides capital to the middle market in the U.S. Over the past 15 years, we have provided capital to over 350 companies across 35 industries in North America.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's standalone results to its consolidated results for the year ended December 31, 2014.\n (4) For MOF II, SMAs and Medley SBIC, the Gross Portfolio Internal Rate of Return represents the cumulative investment performance from inception of each respective fund through December 31, 2016. The Gross Portfolio Internal Rate of Return includes both realized and unrealized investments and excludes the impact of base management fees, incentive fees and other fund related expenses. For realized investments, the investment returns were calculated based on the actual cash outflows and inflows for each respective investment and include all interest, principal and fee note repayments, dividends and transactions fees, if applicable. For unrealized investments, the investment returns were calculated based on the actual cash outflows and inflows for each respective investment and include all interest, principal and fee note repayments, dividends and transactions fees, if applicable. The investment return assumes that the remaining unrealized portion of the investment is realized at the investment's most recent fair value, as calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There can be no assurance that the investments will be realized at these fair values and actual results may differ significantly. \nNet Income Margin is the U.S. GAAP financial measure most comparable to Core Net Income Margin. Net Income margin is equal to Net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC divided by total revenue and for the year ended December 31, 2014, total standalone revenue. The following table is a reconciliation of Net Income Margin to Core Net Income Margin.\nOther Revenues and Fees. We provide administrative services to certain of our vehicles that are reported as other revenues and fees. Such fees are recognized as revenue in the period that administrative services are rendered. These fees are generally based on expense reimbursements for the portion of overhead and other expenses incurred by certain professionals directly attributable to each respective fund. These fees are reported within total revenues in our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\n \u2022 make changes in the nature of their business; and \nIncome Taxes\nIn March 2014, we issued a promissory note in the amount of $2.5 million to a former Medley member in connection with the purchase of his membership interests. The promissory note carried no interest, had quarterly amortization payments of $0.3 million and matured in March 2016.\nWe have an obligation to pay our professionals a portion of the performance fees earned from certain funds. These amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the recognition of the related performance fee revenue and, until paid, are recognized as performance fee compensation payable. Performance fee compensation is recognized in the same period that the related performance fees are recognized. Performance fee compensation can be reversed during periods when there is a decline in performance fees that were previously recognized.\nInvesting Activities\nOther Income (Expenses), Net. Other income (expenses), net consists primarily of expenses associated with our revenue share payable, equity income (loss) and unrealized gains (losses) associated with our equity method investments.\nNet Change in Unrealized Depreciation (Appreciation) on Secured Borrowings of Consolidated Funds. Net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on secured borrowings of Consolidated Funds reflects both unrealized gains and losses from periodic changes in the fair value of these secured borrowings attributable to loan participations of our Consolidated Funds and the reversal upon repayments of these secured borrowings of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for these secured borrowings. The net change in unrealized depreciation (appreciation) on secured borrowings of Consolidated Funds is attributable to the counterparty to the loan participations. As such, these unrealized gains and losses have no material impact on the net income attributable to Medley Management Inc. and non-controlling interests in Medley LLC.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nPerformance fees receivable is presented separately in our audited consolidated statements of financial condition included in this Form 10-K and represents performance fees recognized but not yet collected. The timing of the payment of performance fees due to the general partner or investment manager varies depending on the terms of the applicable fund agreements.\nAUM refers to the assets of our funds. We view AUM as a metric to measure our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets generally at fair value plus available uncalled capital. For our funds, our AUM equals the sum of the following:\nCompensation and Benefits. Compensation and benefits increased by $1.0 million, or 4% to $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to an increase in salaries, that resulted from an increase in headcount, and an increase in stock-based compensation expense, partly offset by a decrease in discretionary compensation during the year ended December 31, 2016\n (3) Average Recovery includes only those realized investments in which we experience a loss of principal on a cumulative cash flow basis and is calculated by dividing the total actual cash inflows for each respective investment, including all interest, principal and fee note repayments, dividends and transactions fees, if applicable, by the total actual cash outflows for each respective investment. For MCC, MOF II and the SMAs, we have presented the Average Recovery as NM\u201d or Not Meaningful\u201d because we believe the number of realized losses for each respective vehicle is not sufficient to provide an accurate representation of the expected Average Recovery for each vehicle. \n (5) Earnings from Medley SBIC are paid to MCC. The Net Internal Rate of Return for Medley SBIC was calculated based upon i) the actual cash contribution and distributions to/from MCC and Medley SBIC ii) an allocable portion of MCC's management and incentive fees and general fund related expenses and iii) assumes the NAV as of the measurement date is distributed to MCC. As of December 31, 2016, Medley SBIC Net Internal Rate of Return as described above assuming only the inclusion of management fees was 21.0%. \nPerformance Fees. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs may have industry standard carried interest performance fee structures and are typically 15% to 20% of the total return over a 6.0% to 8.0% annualized preferred return. We record these fees on an accrual basis, to the extent such amounts are contractually due but not paid, and we present this revenue as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations. These fees are subject to repayment (clawback).\n \u2022 Part II Incentive Fees. For our permanent capital vehicles and certain of our long-dated private funds, Part II incentive fees generally represent 20.0% of each fund's cumulative realized capital gains (net of realized capital \nTotal fee earning AUM increased by $1.0 billion, or 52%, to $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2014 compared to total fee earning AUM as of December 31, 2013 and was due primarily to increased commitments from permanent capital vehicles.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net cash flow used in operating activities also includes net purchases of investments by our Consolidated Funds, of $293.7 million and change in cash and cash equivalents of the Consolidated Funds of $22.2 million. These amounts represent the significant variances between net income and cash flows from operations and are reflected as operating activities pursuant to investment company accounting guidance. The growth of our business is reflected by the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of our core segment, while the fund-related activities requirements vary based upon the specific investment activities being conducted during such period. The movements within our Consolidated Funds do not adversely impact our liquidity or earnings trends. We believe that our ability to generate cash from operations provides us the necessary liquidity to manage short-term fluctuations in working capital as well as to meet our short-term commitments.\nAUM increased by $1.4 billion, or 61%, to $3.7 billion as of December 31, 2014 compared to AUM as of December 31, 2013. Our permanent capital vehicles increased AUM by $974.9 million, or 76%, primarily associated with new equity issuances and increased leverage capacity at both MCC and SIC during the period. Our long-dated private funds and SMAs increased AUM by $424.4 million, or 42%, primarily associated with new capital commitments from our SMAs.\nMedley SBIC LP (Medley SBIC)\nCertain Covenants and Events of Default\nSenior Unsecured Debt\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) on Investments of Consolidated Funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds consists of realized gains and losses arising from dispositions of investments held by our Consolidated Funds. Substantially all of the net investment gains (losses) of our Consolidated Funds are generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and allocated to non-controlling interests.\n (1) Net Income Margin equals Net income attributable to Medley LLC divided by total revenue and, for periods prior to January 1, 2015, total standalone revenue. \n (4) Represents equity commitments by us to certain long-dated private funds managed by us. These amounts are generally due on demand and are therefore presented in the less than one year category. \nOur material source of cash from our operations is management fees, which are collected quarterly. We primarily use cash flows from operations to pay compensation and benefits, general, administrative and other expenses, debt service costs and income and tax distributions to our members. Our cash flows, together with the proceeds from equity and debt issuances, are also used to fund investments in limited partnerships, purchase of available-for-sale securities, acquisition of fixed assets and other capital items. If cash flow from operations were insufficient to fund distributions, we expect that we would suspend paying such distributions.\n____________\nOther Income (Expense)\nHolders of equity interests in Medley LLC (other than Medley Management Inc.) were, subject to limited exceptions, prohibited from transferring any such equity interests that were held by them as of September 23, 2014 (the date of consummation of the IPO of Medley Management Inc.), or any shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock received upon exchange of such LLC equity interests, until September 23, 2017 without Medley Management Inc.'s consent. Thereafter and prior to September 23, 2018 and September 23, 2019, such holders may not transfer more than 33 1/3% and 66 2/3%, respectively, of the number of any shares of Medley LLC's equity interests held by them as of September 23, 2014, together with the number of any shares of Medley Management Inc.'s Class A common stock received by them upon exchange therefor, without Medley Management Inc.'s consent. While this agreement could be amended or waived by Medley Management Inc., the holders of the equity interests in Medley LLC (other than Medley Management Inc.) have advised us that they do not intend to seek any waivers of these restrictions.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n2026 Notes\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn August 9, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $25.0 million of an aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount. On October 18, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $28.6 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 at a public offering price of $24.45 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. The notes mature on August 15, 2026 and interest is payable quarterly. The notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at Medley's option on or after August 15, 2019 at a redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan Facility. The notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trades thereon under the trading symbol MDLX.\u201d\n \u2022 engage in certain transactions with affiliates; \n (3) Our future interest obligations on debt outstanding assume an interest rate of 6.5% on our Term Loan balance and an interest of 6.875% on our senior unsecured debt balance. \nMedley Opportunity Fund III LP (MOF III)\n \u2022 The attractiveness of our product offering to investors. We believe defined contribution plans, retail investors, public institutional investors, pension funds, endowments, sovereign wealth funds and insurance companies are increasing exposure to directly originated private credit investment products to seek differentiated returns and current yield. Our permanent capital vehicles and long-dated private funds and SMAs benefit from this demand by offering institutional and retail investors the ability to invest in our private credit investment strategy. We believe that the breadth, diversity and number of investment vehicles we offer allow us to maximize our reach with investors. \nGuaranteed payments made to our senior professionals who are members of Medley LLC are recognized as compensation expense. The guaranteed payments to our Co-Chief Executive Officers are performance based and periodically set subject to maximums based on our total assets under management. Such maximums aggregated to $5.0 million, $3.0 million and $3.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. Commencing with the fourth quarter of 2014 and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, neither of our Co-Chief Executive Officers received any guaranteed payments.\n (2) If the pre-IPO owners exchanged all of their LLC Units for shares of Class A common stock, they would hold 80.07% of the outstanding shares of Class A common stock, entitling them to an equivalent percentage of economic interests and voting power in Medley Management Inc., Medley Group LLC would hold no voting power or economic interests in Medley Management Inc. and Medley Management Inc. would hold 100% of outstanding LLC Units and 100% of the voting power in Medley LLC. \nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in this Form 10-K.\nthese increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement, including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement. This payment obligation is an obligation of Medley Management Inc. and not of Medley LLC. For purposes of the tax receivable agreement, the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of Medley Management Inc. (calculated with certain assumptions) to the amount of such taxes that Medley Management Inc. would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of Medley LLC as a result of the exchanges and had Medley Management Inc. not entered into the tax receivable agreement. Estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise, insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors. While the actual increase in tax basis, as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement, will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the timing of exchanges, the price of shares of our Class A common stock at the time of the exchange, the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income. See Certain Relationships and Related Person Transactions - Tax Receivable Agreement\u201d described in our Prospectus. We anticipate that we will account for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the tax receivable agreement arising from future exchanges as follows:\n\nWe manage two permanent capital vehicles, both of which are BDCs, as well as long-dated private funds and SMAs, focusing on senior secured credit.\n \u2022 Base Management Fees. Base management fees are generally based on a defined percentage of (i) average or total gross assets, including assets acquired with leverage, (ii) total commitments, (iii) net invested capital, (iv) NAV or (v) lower of cost or market value of a fund's portfolio investments. These fees are calculated quarterly and are paid in cash in advance or in arrears depending on each specific fund. Base management fees are recognized as revenue in the period advisory services are rendered, subject to our assessment of collectability. \nGeneral, Administrative and Other Expenses. General, administrative and other expenses increased by $0.5 million, or 3%, to $16.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due primarily to an increase in expense support agreement expenses related to SIC and an overall increase in general, administrative and other expenses due to an overall growth of our business. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in organization and offering expenses of SIC as a result of Medley not being liable for these expenses as of June 2, 2014.\nNon-Recourse Promissory Notes\nInterest Rate and Fees\nWe believe that our disciplined investment philosophy contributes to the stability of our firm's performance. Our results of operations, including the fair value of our AUM, are affected by a variety of factors, including conditions in the global financial markets as well as economic and political environments, particularly in the U.S.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 89%, 89% and 88%, respectively, of our revenues were generated from management fees and performance fees derived primarily from net interest income on senior secured loans.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased by $0.8 million, or 9%, to $9.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an acceleration of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount relating to prepayments made on our Term Loan Facility as a result of the refinancing of our indebtedness from the issuance of senior unsecured debt. Average debt outstanding during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $106.0 million and $105.9 million, respectively.\n (1) We lease office space in New York and San Francisco under non-cancelable lease agreements. In August 2015, the Company signed a new lease for its office space in New York City. The Company's obligations under the current terms of these leases extend through September 2023. The amounts in this table represent the minimum lease payments required over the term of the lease, and include operating leases for office equipment. \nAs of December 31, 2016, the outstanding senior unsecured debt balance was $49.8 million, which is reflected net of unamortized discount and debt issuance costs of $3.8 million.\n (6) Net Investor Internal Rate of Return for MOF II was calculated net of all management fees and carried interest allocation since inception and was computed based on the actual dates of capital contributions and the ending aggregate partners' capital at the end of the period. \nOur primary cash flow activities involve: (i) generating cash flow from operations, which largely includes management fees; (ii) making distributions to our owners; and (iii) borrowings, interest payments and repayments under our debt facilities. As of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were $49.6 million and our restricted cash equivalents balance was $4.9 million.\nIn general, our institutional investors do not have the right to withdraw capital commitments and, to date, we have not experienced any withdrawals of capital commitments. For a description of the risk factor associated with capital commitments, see Risk Factors - Third-party investors in our private funds may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested, which could adversely affect a fund's operations and performance.\u201d\nIn accordance with ASC 810, Consolidation, we consolidate those entities where we have a direct and indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. As such, we consolidate entities that we conclude are VIEs, for which we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary and entities in which we hold a majority voting interest or have majority ownership and control over the operational, financial and investing decisions of that entity.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had over $5.3 billion of AUM in two business development companies, MCC and SIC, as well as private investment vehicles. Our year over year AUM growth as of December 31, 2016 was 12% and was driven in large part by the growth of our long-dated private funds and SMAs. Our compounded annual AUM growth rate from December 31, 2010 through December 31, 2016 was 32% and our compounded annual Fee Earning AUM growth rate of 23%, both of which have been driven in large part by the growth in our permanent capital vehicles. Since September 2015, we received over $1.5 billion of new institutional capital commitments, bringing AUM to over $5.3 billion. Typically the investment periods of our institutional commitments range from 18 to 24 months and we expect our Fee Earning AUM to increase as capital commitments included in AUM are invested.\nFor those entities that qualify as a VIE, the primary beneficiary is generally defined as the party who has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. We are generally deemed to have a controlling financial interest if we have the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance, and the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE at the time we become initially involved with the VIE and we reconsider that conclusion continuously. The primary beneficiary evaluation is generally performed qualitatively on the basis of all facts and circumstances. However, quantitative information may also be considered in the analysis, as appropriate. These assessments require judgments. Each entity is assessed for consolidation on a case-by-case basis.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In applying many of these accounting principles, we need to make assumptions, estimates or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates or judgments, however, are both subjective and subject to change, and actual results may differ from our assumptions and estimates. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known. We believe the following critical accounting policies could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nAs of December 31, 2016, fee earning AUM based on gross asset value decreased by $31.5 million, or 1%, compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease in fee earning AUM based on gross asset value was due primarily to a decrease at MCC that resulted from lower leverage capacity, a decline in portfolio asset valuations and share repurchases, partly offset by new equity issuances at SIC.\n \u2022 for the aforementioned funds beyond the investment period and certain managed accounts within their investment period, the amount of limited partner invested capital or the NAV of the fund (see Fee earning AUM based on invested capital or NAV\u201d in the Components of Fee Earning AUM\u201d table below for the amount of this component of fee earning AUM as of each period). \nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) on Investments of Consolidated Funds. Net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of Consolidated Funds reflects both unrealized gains and losses on investments from periodic changes in fair value of investments held by our Consolidated Funds and the reversal upon disposition of investments of unrealized gains and losses previously recognized for those investments. The net change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments of Consolidated Funds is generally attributable to the related funds' limited partners and allocated to non-controlling interests.\nDeconsolidated Funds\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, net contributions from non-controlling interests in our Consolidated Funds were $131.4 million and net proceeds from secured borrowings were $100.6 million. There was no impact on our cash flows relating to our Consolidated Funds for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nReturns\nWe also generally earn performance fees from our long-dated private funds and SMAs. Typically, these performance fees are 15.0% to 20.0% of the total return above a hurdle rate. These performance fees are accrued quarterly and paid after return of all invested capital and an amount sufficient to achieve the hurdle rate of return.\nIn addition to analyzing our results on a GAAP basis, management also makes operating decisions and assesses business performance based on the financial and operating metrics and data that are presented without the impact of consolidation of any funds. Core Net Income, Core EBITDA, Core Net Income Per Share and Core Net Income Margin are non-GAAP financial measures that are used by management to assess the performance of our business. There are limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as compared to the use of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure and these measures supplement and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under \u2018\u2018- Results of Operations,'' which are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Furthermore, such measures may be inconsistent with measures presented by other companies. For a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure in accordance with U.S. GAAP, see \u2018\u2018- Reconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures to Consolidated U.S. GAAP Financial Measures.''\nOn January 18, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 7.25% senior notes due 2024 at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount of notes. On February 22, 2017, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $34.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes at a public offering price of $25.25 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. The notes mature on January 30, 2024 and interest is payable quarterly commencing on April 30, 2017. The notes will be redeemable in whole or in part at Medley's option on or after January 30, 2020 at a redemption price of 100% of the aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest payments. We used the net proceeds from the offering to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility and for general corporate purposes. The notes are listed on the New York Stock Exchange and trade thereon under the trading symbol MDLQ.\u201d\n____________\nPerformance Fee Compensation. There was a reversal in performance fee compensation of $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to a reversal of performance fee compensation of $8.0 million for the same period in 2015. The variance in performance fee compensation was due primarily to changes in projected future payments.\nConsolidated Funds\n \u2022 to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset, based on an analysis that will consider, among other things, our expectation of future earnings, we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance; and \nReconciliation of Certain Non-GAAP Performance Measures to Consolidated U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\n (7) Medley GP Holdings LLC holds 96.5% of the Class B economic interests in each of MCOF GP LLC, and Medley (Aspect) GP LLC. \nNet Income Attributable to Non-Controlling Interests in Consolidated Funds. Net income attributable to non-controlling interests in Consolidated Funds decreased by $29.7 million to zero for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same\n (3) With respect to permanent capital vehicles, represents distributions of income. With respect to long-dated private funds and SMAs, represents return of capital, given our funds' stage in their respective life cycle and the prioritization of capital distributions. \n (4) For year ended December 31, 2016, other non-core items consist of a $0.6 million acceleration of amortization of debt issuance costs and discount relating to prepayments made on our Term Loan Facility as a result of the refinancing of our indebtedness from the issuance of senior unsecured debt, a $0.5 million impairment loss on our investment in CK Pearl Fund and a $0.2 million severance cost to former employees. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, other non-core items consist of severance costs to former employees. \nCash Flows\nDividend Income. Dividend income increased by $0.4 million to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due to dividend income from our investment in available-for-sale securities which were acquired during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nNet income attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries increased by $3.4 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was due primarily to a reversal of MOF II performance fees for the year ended December 31, 2015, a portion of which was allocated to non-controlling interests in consolidated subsidiaries.\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014\nDuring the first half of fiscal year 2016, economic conditions continued to be unpredictable and volatile as it was during fiscal year 2015. However, during the second half of fiscal year 2016, broad economic markets showed stability and loan volumes across the lending spectrum improved. Loan funds received significant inflows while CLO issuances continued to increase in the second half of 2016. Both these factors drove significant volume in the loan market and drove pricing lower. As a result, the opportunity set for appropriate risk-adjusted investments reduced. Our platform provides us the ability to lend across the capital structure and at varying interest rates providing our firm access to a larger borrower subset over time; however, we believe the deployment of capital during fiscal year 2016, was prudent and cautious in-light of the prevailing market conditions.\n \u2022 The strength of our investment process, operating platform and client servicing capabilities. Following the most recent financial crisis, investors in alternative investments, including those managed by us, have heightened their focus on matters such as manager due diligence, reporting transparency and compliance infrastructure. Since inception, we have invested heavily in our investment monitoring systems, compliance and enterprise risk management systems to proactively address investor expectations and the evolving regulatory landscape. We believe these investments in operating infrastructure will continue to support our growth in AUM. \nOn September 29, 2014, we completed the IPO of Medley Management Inc. pursuant to which we sold 6,000,000 shares of common stock at a price of $18.00 per share. Total proceeds from the offering, net of offering expenses payable by us, were $96.7 million and were recorded as contributions from members.\n____________\n (7) Net Investor Internal Rate of Return for our SMAs was calculated using the Gross Portfolio Internal Rate of Return, as described in note 4, and includes the actual management fees, incentive fees and general fund related expenses. \n (1) Represents a pro-forma adjustment for the amortization of stock-based compensation expense associated with grants of restricted stock units at the time of the IPO of Medley Management Inc. \n \u2022 Our permanent capital vehicles generated an additional $12.4 million in management fees for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. Management fees from SIC increased $12.7 million due to a 43% increase in fee earning AUM over that period and due to an increase in Part I incentive fees. Management fees from MCC decreased $0.2 million due to a decrease in Part I incentive fees, partially offset by a $2.2 million increase in base management fees over that period. \nSee Note 9, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K for a discussion of our commitments and contingencies.\nComponents of Fee Earning AUM\n\n\nThe significant captions and amounts from our consolidated financial statements, which for the year ended December 31, 2014, include the effects of our Consolidated Funds in accordance with U.S. GAAP, are summarized below. Negative amounts represent a net outflow, or use of cash.\nNet unrealized and realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds, excluding the amount attributable to loan participations, decreased by $18.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 due to the deconsolidation of MOF I and MOF II as of January 1, 2015. There was no unrealized or realized gain (loss) on investments of Consolidated Funds for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOur sources of liquidity are (i) cash on hand, (ii) net working capital, (iii) cash flows from operations, (iv) realizations on our investments, (v) net proceeds from borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and issuances of publicly-registered debt and (vi) other potential financings. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements and to meet our commitments in the foreseeable future. We expect that our primary liquidity needs will be comprised of cash to (i) provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing investment management business, (ii) fund our commitments to funds that we advise, (iii) provide capital to facilitate our expansion into business that are complementary to our existing investment management business, (iv) pay operating expenses, including cash compensation to our employees, (v) fund capital expenditures, (vi) pay income taxes, and (vii) make distributions to our unitholders.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense relating to debt incurred by us.\nMedley Group LLC, an entity wholly-owned by the pre-IPO owners, holds all 100 issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. For so long as the pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel hold at least 10% of the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units (excluding those LLC Units held by Medley Management Inc.), which we refer to as the Substantial Ownership Requirement,\u201d the Class B common stock entitles Medley Group LLC, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by it, to a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC that do not themselves hold shares of Class B common stock and entitle each other holder of Class B common stock, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by such other holder, to a number of votes that is equal to 10 times the number of LLC Units held by such holder. For purposes of calculating the Substantial Ownership Requirement, (1) shares of Class A common stock deliverable to the pre-IPO owners and then-current Medley personnel pursuant to outstanding equity awards will be deemed then outstanding and (2) shares of Class A common stock and LLC Units held by any estate, trust, partnership or limited liability company or other similar entity of which any pre-IPO owner or then-current Medley personnel, or any immediate family member thereof, is a trustee, partner, member or similar party will be considered held by such pre-IPO owner or other then-current Medley personnel. From and after the time that the Substantial Ownership Requirement is no longer satisfied, the Class B common stock will entitle Medley Group LLC, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by it, to a number of votes that is equal to the aggregate number of LLC Units held by all non-managing members of Medley LLC that do not themselves hold shares of Class B common stock and entitle each other holder of Class B common stock, without regard to the number of shares of Class B common stock held by such other holder, to a number of votes that is equal to the number of LLC Units held by such holder. At the completion of the IPO of Medley Management Inc., the pre-IPO owners were comprised of all of the non-managing members of Medley LLC. However, Medley LLC may in the future admit additional non-managing members that would not constitute pre-IPO owners. If at any time the ratio at which LLC Units are exchangeable for shares of our Class A common stock changes from one-for-one as set forth in the Exchange Agreement, the number of votes to which Class B common stockholders are entitled will be adjusted accordingly. Holders of shares of our Class B common stock will vote together with holders of our Class A common stock as a single class on all matters on which stockholders are entitled to vote generally, except as otherwise required by law.\nOverview\nOur Revolving Credit Facility contains certain customary representations and warranties, affirmative covenants and events of default. If an event of default occurs, the lender under the Revolving Credit Facility will be entitled to take various actions,\n (2) Represents the permanent reduction in equity or leverage during the period. \nOur Structure\nResults of Operations\n (2) With respect to the year ended December 31, 2014, Core Net Income includes a pro-forma adjustment to reflect guaranteed payments to Medley LLC members as compensation expense. Prior to the Company's Reorganization and IPO these payments were recorded as distributions from members' capital. \nFor any given period, performance fee revenue on our consolidated statements of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date. Since fund return hurdles are cumulative, previously recognized fees also may be reversed in a period of appreciation that is lower than the particular fund's hurdle rate. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not reverse previously recognized performance fees. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we reversed $24.0 million of previously recognized performance fees. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we reversed $4.4 million and $2.3 million of previously recognized performance fees on a standalone and consolidated basis, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we recognized cumulative performance fees of $7.1 million.\nSierra Income Corporation (SIC)\nWe intend to use a portion of our available liquidity to fund cash distributions to our unitholders on a quarterly basis. Our ability to fund cash distributions to our unitholders is dependent on a myriad of factors, including among others: general economic and business conditions; our strategic plans and prospects; our business and investment opportunities; timing of capital calls by our funds in support of our commitments; our financial condition and operating results; working capital requirements and other anticipated cash needs; contractual restrictions and obligations; legal, tax and regulatory restrictions; restrictions on the payment of distributions by our subsidiaries to us; and other relevant factors.\nOn August 9, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of $25.0 million of an aggregate principal amount of 6.875% senior notes due 2026 (the 2026 Notes\u201d) at a public offering price of 100% of the principal amount. On October 18, 2016, Medley LLC completed a public offering of an additional $28.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Notes at a public offering price of $24.45 for each $25.00 principal amount of notes. We used the net proceeds from these offerings to repay a portion of the outstanding indebtedness under the Term Loan Facility. Collectively, these offerings compose the senior unsecured debt balance as of December 31, 2016\nInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements and their impact on us can be found in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-K.\nManaging Business Performance\nNon-Controlling Interests\nlosses and unrealized capital depreciation). We have not received these fees historically, and do not expect such fees to be material in the future given our focus on senior secured lending.\n\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to either (1) a Eurodollar margin over an adjusted LIBOR rate or (2) a base rate margin over an adjusted base rate determined by reference to the highest of (a) the term loan administrative agent's prime rate; (b) the federal funds effective rate in effect on such day plus 0.5%; and (c) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 1.0%. The applicable margins for the Revolving Credit Facility are (i) if the ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA is less than 1.0 to 1.0, 1.5% in the case of adjusted base rate loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar loans, (x) 3.0% until maturity; and (ii) if the ratio of net debt to Core EBITDA is greater than or equal to 1.0 to 1.0, 2.50% in the case of adjusted base rate loans, and, in the case of Eurodollar loans, (x) 3.25% until maturity. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding principal under the Revolving Credit Facility, we are required to pay an unused line fee of 0.25% per annum of the unused portion of the commitments.\nContractual Obligations\nFor legal entities evaluated for consolidation, we must determine whether the interests that it holds and fees paid to it qualify as a variable interest in an entity. This includes an evaluation of the management fees and performance fees paid to us when acting as a decision maker or service provider to the entity being evaluated. Under the new guidance, fees received by us that are customary and commensurate with the level of services provided, and we don't hold other economic interests in the entity that would absorb more than an insignificant amount of the expected losses or returns of the entity, would not be considered a variable interest. We factor in all economic interests including proportionate interests through related parties, to determine if fees are considered a variable interest. Prior to the adoption of the new consolidation guidance, these fees were considered variable interests by us.\n\n\n \u2022 we will record 85% of the estimated realizable tax benefit (which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance) as an increase to the liability due under the tax receivable agreement and the remaining 15% of the estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to additional paid-in capital. \nAs of December 31, 2016, fee earning AUM based on invested capital or NAV decreased by $80.7 million, or 8%, compared to December 31, 2015. The decrease in fee earning AUM based on invested capital or NAV was due primarily to distributions of income and return of capital by our long-dated private funds and SMAs as some of our vehicles are no longer in the investment period, partly offset by new capital commitments from our long-dated private funds and SMAs.", "item_7_tables": "Table 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

million in 2015 compared to 2014, driven primarily by increased commitments from permanent capital vehicles. \n\n- Net income attributable to Medley LLC was $8 million in 2016, down from $23 million in 2015 and $38 million in 2014. The decreases were largely due to lower performance fees.\n\n- Management fees, which make up the majority of revenues, were $65 million in 2016, $76 million in 2015, and $61 million in 2014. The increase from 2014 to 2015 was driven by higher management fees from permanent capital vehicles.\n\n- Performance fees swung from $2 million in 2014 to $(16) million in 2015 and $2 million in 2016. The variability is due to changes in valuation of the underlying funds. \n\n- Expenses were $56 million in 2016, up from $36 million in 2015, primarily due to higher general, administrative and other expenses.\n\n- As of December 31, 2016, assets under management (AUM) were $5.3 billion, up 12% from 2015, driven by growth in long-dated private funds and SMAs. \n\n- Fee earning AUM was $3.2 billion at the end of 2016, down slightly from 2015 due to distributions from funds no longer in the investment period.\n\n- The company has debt obligations of $175 million over the next 5+ years relating to loans payable, senior unsecured debt, interest payments, and other commitments.\n\nIn summary, Medley saw AUM growth in 2016 but a decrease in fee earning AUM and net income compared to prior years, largely attributed to lower performance fees. The company has significant debt obligations coming due over the next few years."}
