See \"Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement\" for further information on forward-looking statements.\nPending Acquisition by Brookfield\nOn December 21, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company will be acquired by an affiliate of the Brookfield Infrastructure Group ( Brookfield\u201d), the infrastructure investment division of Brookfield Asset Management (the Merger\u201d). At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), each of our issued and outstanding Common Shares will be converted into the right to receive $10.50 in cash per Common Share, without interest, and the 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares will remain issued and outstanding as 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of the Company, without par value, following the Effective Time.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding Common Shares and 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares, voting as a single class; (ii) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended and (iii) the receipt of any required consents or approvals from (a) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, (b) the Federal Communications Commission, (c) state public service and state public utility commissions, and (d) local regulators in connection with the provision of telecommunications and media services; and (iv) the absence of any legal restraint preventing the consummation of the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this nature.\nThe Merger is expected to close by the end of 2020, although there can be no assurance that the Merger will occur by that date. As a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company.\nUnsolicited Proposal\nOn January 22, 2020, the Company received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from an infrastructure fund (the Fund\u201d) to acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares for $12.00 per share in cash (the Proposal\u201d). On January 23, 2020, the Company commenced discussions with the Fund regarding the Proposal following the Board of Directors having made the required determinations under the Merger Agreement that allow it to do so. The Board also reaffirmed its recommendation in support of the Merger.\nExecutive Summary\nSegment results described in the Executive Summary and Consolidated Results of Operations section are net of intercompany and intersegment eliminations.\nOn July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc. (\"Hawaiian Telcom\"). The Unified Communications as a Service (\"UCaaS\"), hardware, and enterprise long distance products and services provided by the Hawaiian Telcom business are included within the IT Services and Hardware segment. The Entertainment and Communications segment includes products delivered by Hawaiian Telcom such as high-speed internet access, digital subscriber lines, ethernet, dedicated internet access, indefeasible right of use (\"IRU\"), video, voice lines, consumer long distance and digital trunking.\nConsolidated revenue totaled $1,536.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $158.5 million compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $346.7 million and $175.0 million of revenue in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue growth from the acquisition was partially offset by the decline in Legacy revenue exceeding the growth in revenue from our fiber offerings in Cincinnati as well as the decline of higher margin revenue contributed by General Electric Company ( GE\u201d) of $20.6 million in the Cloud practice. Fioptics revenue in Cincinnati increased $12.0 million while Legacy revenue in Cincinnati decreased $25.1 million in 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe increases in cost of services and products, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d), and depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily related to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income in 2019 was $73.1 million, down $10.2 million compared to the same period in 2018. The revenue contribution from Hawaiian Telcom in addition to the decrease in transaction and integration costs were more than offset by declines in Legacy revenue and increases in cost of services and products, depreciation and amortization and SG&A costs.\nLoss before income taxes totaled $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase in the loss of $16.8 million as compared to the comparable period in 2018. In addition to the items impacting operating income, the increased loss before income taxes is primarily due to increased interest expense related to additional debt acquired to fund the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nRevenue\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Entertainment and Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 974.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 831.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 684.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IT Services and Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 562.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 547.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 380.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 166.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,536.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,378.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 158.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,065.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 312.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEntertainment and Communications revenue increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed revenue of $306.6 million and $155.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In Cincinnati, the growth in Fioptics partially mitigated the decline in Legacy revenue. Fioptics revenue in Cincinnati totaled $353.2 million, $341.2 million and $309.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, up 4% in 2019 and up 10% in 2018 from the comparable prior year.\nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom which contributed revenue of $40.1 million and $19.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition to the impact of the acquisition, increased revenue from the Communications and Consulting practices was partially offset by lower revenue in the Cloud and Infrastructure Solutions practices. Cloud revenue decline is primarily due to lower revenue contributed by GE of $20.6 million due to GE insourcing certain cloud services. Revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of OnX that closed in the fourth quarter of 2017, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\nOperating costs\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services and products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Entertainment and Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 384.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 304.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IT Services and Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 339.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 314.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of services and products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 784.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 698.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 531.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 167.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEntertainment and Communications costs increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom which contributed costs of $150.9 million and $80.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact associated with the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased $9.9 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in the prior year. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 is due to lower contract services costs and lower payroll related costs due to headcount reductions made during restructuring initiatives that were executed in 2017 and 2018. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to lower payroll related costs resulting from restructuring initiatives which were partially offset by increased video content costs due to higher rates charged by our content providers.\nIT Services and Hardware costs increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased payroll and contractor costs associated with resources utilized to support the revenue growth in the Communications and Consulting practices for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition, Hawaiian Telcom contributed $21.9 million and $9.8 million to cost of services and products in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Costs increased in 2018 compared to the prior year comparable period primarily due to expense associated with headcount in place for twelve months in 2018 versus three months in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of OnX.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general, and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Entertainment and Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 179.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 120.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IT Services and Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 153.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 151.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 354.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 313.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 235.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 78.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEntertainment and Communications SG&A expenses were up in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed SG&A expense of $64.2 million and $32.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. SG&A costs also increased in 2019 compared to the prior year due to an increase in advertising expense and the bad debt reserve for certain receivables with a wholesale customer that filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019 whose collectability remains uncertain. These increases were partially offset as the segment continues to focus on cost containment and realizing synergies with Hawaiian Telcom. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by lower payroll costs in Cincinnati that are a result of headcount reductions from restructuring initiatives that were executed in the first quarter of 2017.\nIT Services and Hardware SG&A costs increased in 2019 compared to the prior year due to additional expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed SG&A costs of $9.4 million and $5.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2019 was partially offset by lower payroll costs resulting from headcount reductions carried out in 2018. SG&A costs were up in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to expense associated with headcount in place for twelve months in 2018 versus three months in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of OnX.\nCorporate SG&A costs increased in 2019 driven largely by higher payroll related costs.

Interest expense increased in 2018 compared to comparable period in the prior year due to financing transactions that took place during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company entered into the $600.0 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024, issued $350.0 million 8% Senior Notes, and repaid the remaining $315.8 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2020 outstanding under its previous Corporate Credit Agreement with the proceeds from the $600.0 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024.\nOther components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expense was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $4.0 million pension settlement charge for the Cincinnati Bell Pension Plan (\"CBPP\") in 2017 as a result of the lump sum payments to CBPP participants exceeding the sum of the service cost and interest cost component of net pension cost for the year.\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a gain of $117.7 million on the sale of 2.8 million CyrusOne common shares.\nIncome tax expense fluctuates based on changes in income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for non-deductible expenses, as well as rate changes. In periods without tax law changes, the Company expects its effective tax rate to exceed statutory rates due to non-deductible expenses. Non-deductible expenses related to the Brookfield transaction were incurred during 2019 in the amount of $11.1 million. Non-deductible expenses related to the acquisitions of Hawaiian Telcom and OnX were incurred during 2018 and 2017 in the amount of $9.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively. In addition, changes in the valuation allowance impact income tax expense. In 2018, a valuation allowance of $14.8 million was established against non-deductible interest, which increased by $1.8 million in 2019. Valuation allowances on state NOLs decreased in 2019 by $2.9 million compared to the prior year.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company uses federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to defray payment of federal and state tax liabilities.

Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC (\"CBT\"), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier (\"ILEC\") for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for over 145 years. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC (\"CBET\"), a subsidiary of CBT. On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in the state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of over 135 years as Hawaii's communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii's major islands, except its video service, which currently is only available on the island of Oahu.\nConsumer/SMB Fiber products include high-speed internet access, voice lines and video. The Company is able to deliver speeds of up to 30 megabits or more to approximately 75% of Greater Cincinnati and up to 20 megabits or more to approximately 50% of Hawaii's total addressable market.\nEnterprise Fiber products include metro-ethernet, dedicated internet access, wavelength, IRU contracts, and wireless backhaul to macro-towers and small cells. As enterprise customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the preferred method of transport due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection.\nLegacy products include traditional voice lines, consumer long distance, switched access, digital trunking, DSL, DS0, DS1, DS3 and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return.\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Fioptics and Hawaii Consumer/SMB Fiber (collectively, \"Consumer/SMB Fiber\")\nConsumer/SMB Fiber revenue increased by $56.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $44.9 million. Hawaiian Telcom adds 42,700 video subscribers, 68,200 internet subscribers and 30,000 voice subscribers to the existing base of subscribers. The increase is also a result of the 5% increase in the subscriber base for internet in Cincinnati as we focus our attention on growing the internet FTTP subscriber base. In addition, the Average Revenue Per User ( ARPU\u201d) increased 4% for both internet and video in Cincinnati as compared to the prior year partially offsetting the decline in video subscribers in Cincinnati. ARPU increases are related to price increases for internet and video as well as the change in the mix of subscribers for video.\nConsumer/SMB Fiber revenue increased by $73.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $42.3 million. The remaining revenue increase was due to increases in the subscriber base for internet and voice, as well as rate favorability across all products in Cincinnati. The internet subscriber base in Cincinnati increased by 5% and the voice subscriber base increased by 2%. The video subscriber base decreased by 5%; however, rate increases mitigated the impact of this decline on revenue. The ARPU on a year-to-date basis increased for internet, voice, and video by 3%, 6% and 6%, respectively, compared to the prior year.\nEnterprise Fiber\nEnterprise Fiber revenue increased year over year primarily due to incremental revenue from Hawaiian Telcom of $39.4 million and $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Hawaiian Telcom Enterprise Fiber includes revenue from the SEA-US cable, metro-ethernet and dedicated internet access. In addition, enterprise customers are migrating from legacy product offerings to higher bandwidth fiber solutions, as evidenced by the 15% and 16% increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 75% increase in Hawaii in 2019, compared to the comparable periods in the prior year. The increase to revenue from additional customers is offset by pricing pressures. In 2018, the increase in revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom and migration of customers was partially offset due to a one-time project that was completed in the second quarter of 2017 in the amount of $5.4 million.\nLegacy\nLegacy revenue increased year over year due to incremental revenue from Hawaiian Telcom of $187.4 million and $99.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Hawaiian Telcom adds 42,900 DSL subscribers and 177,100 voice subscribers to the existing base of subscribers. Increased revenue generated by Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset due to declines in both voice lines and DSL subscribers in Cincinnati. Declines in voice lines and DSL subscribers in 2019 and 2018 have contributed to the declining revenue in both of those years. Voice lines in Cincinnati declined 13% in 2019 compared to 2018, and 14% in 2018 compared to 2017, as the traditional voice lines become less relevant. DSL subscribers in Cincinnati decreased by 11% in 2019 compared to 2018, and 12% in 2018 compared to 2017, as subscribers demand the higher speeds that can be provided by fiber. In addition, declines in DS0, DS1, DS3 and digital trunking have contributed to the revenue decline in both 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year as customers migrate away from these solutions to fiber-based solutions.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nCost of services and products increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $70.9 million. After considering the impact of the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased by $8.7 million. This decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to decreases in contract services and payroll costs. The decrease in contract services is driven by savings realized associated with the Company's call center. Lower payroll costs are due to reduced headcount and lower overtime. The reduced headcount is a result of the restructuring that took place in the prior two years. Lower overtime is the result of lower video activations as well as the rollout of certain internet installations performed by the consumer.\nCost of services and products increased in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $80.2 million to cost of services and products in 2018. Excluding the impact associated with the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased by $0.6 million. This decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower payroll costs due to reduced headcount as a result of the restructuring that took place in the first quarter of 2017. Network costs were also down due to a large one-time project recognized in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by higher programming costs resulting from higher rates charged by content providers.\nSG&A expenses increased $31.1 million in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $31.4 million. In addition, bad debt expense increased related to a reserve for certain receivables with a wholesale customer that filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019, and advertising expense increased due to additional media spending. These increases were offset as the segment continues to focus on cost containment and realizing synergies with Hawaiian Telcom. SG&A expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $32.9 million of SG&A expense in 2018. The increase contributed by Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset by decreased payroll related costs as a result of the restructuring that took place in the first quarter of 2017. Payroll related costs were down $5.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were up in 2019 compared to the prior year due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $47.4 million. Excluding the increase associated with the acquisition, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.4 million due to certain property, plant and equipment reaching the end of its useful life. Depreciation and amortization expenses were up in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom as well as assets placed in service in connection with the expansion of our fiber network in Cincinnati. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $44.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense in 2018.\nRestructuring and severance charges recorded in 2019 are related to a severance program for certain management employees as the Company continues its efforts to realize synergies that can be achieved due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Restructuring and severance charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a VSP for certain management employees in Cincinnati as the Company identified efficiencies that can be achieved due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Restructuring and severance charges recorded in 2017 were related to a VSP for certain bargained employees to reduce field and network costs associated with our legacy copper network.\nTable 108:

upgrade and increase capacity for our networks, and to extend the life of our fiber and copper networks. The Company is focused on building FTTP addresses, and during 2019, we passed 12,500 FTTP addresses in Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2019, the Company is able to deliver its Fioptics services with speeds up to 30 megabits or more to 623,400 residential and commercial addresses, or 75% of our operating territory in Cincinnati. Cincinnati construction capital expenditures decreased $13.8 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to passing fewer addresses and the timing of capital expenditures, which does not necessarily coincide with the timing of when addresses become available. Cincinnati installation capital expenditures are primarily related to the timing of expenditures for customer premise equipment utilized for installations. In 2019, Cincinnati installation capital expenditures decreased $2.7 million compared to the prior year.\nCincinnati construction capital expenditures decreased $14.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017 even though we passed 38,800 doors in both 2018 and 2017 due to more efficient capital spending. In addition, construction costs incurred for Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") doors totaled $5.5 million in 2017 compared to $1.4 million in 2018. Cincinnati installation capital expenditures decreased $7.3 million for 2018 compared to 2017 due to fewer video and internet activations in 2018. Installation capital expenditures were also impacted by the timing of expenditures for customer premise equipment utilized for installations as well as the Company's implementation of self-installations in Cincinnati which has led to a decrease in the average cost per install.\nEnterprise Fiber capital expenditures in Cincinnati are related to success-based fiber builds, including associated equipment, for enterprise and carrier projects to provide ethernet services. Other capital expenditures are related to IT projects, cable and equipment maintenance and capacity additions, real estate upgrades and maintenance, plus other minor capital purchases.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nHawaii construction capital expenditures increased $4.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to building out 5,900 new FTTP addresses in 2019, primarily in rural areas and on the neighbor islands. Hawaii installation capital expenditures increased $1.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year which only includes six months of activity subsequent to the acquisition close date.

Hardware revenue increased $16.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased revenue in the Consulting and Communications practices. Consulting revenue increased compared to the prior year due to obtaining significant new customers and projects throughout 2018. Communications revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed $23.9 million of revenue in 2019. In addition, Communications revenue increased as a result of customers migrating to newer technologies which has increased the Company's Hosted UCaaS profiles, NaaS locations and SD-Wan locations. This increase was partially offset by the decline in one-time Communications projects and legacy long distance revenue decline. Cloud revenue decreased compared to the prior year as increased revenue from one-time projects was more than offset by lower revenue contributed by GE of $20.6 million. Infrastructure Solutions revenue also decreased due to a decline in one-time projects and hardware sales.\nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased $165.8 million in 2018 compared to the comparable period in 2017. Consulting and Infrastructure Solutions are the main contributors to this revenue increase in 2018, primarily due the acquisition of OnX in the fourth quarter of 2017. OnX contributed $87.2 million in Consulting revenue and $85.0 million in Infrastructure Solutions revenue for the year ended 2018 compared to $19.2 million in Consulting revenue and $27.7 million in Infrastructure Solutions for the year ended 2017. OnX also provided contributions in Cloud revenue, driving the $17.0 million increase in Cloud revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, Hawaiian Telcom contributed $20.0 million in revenue in 2018, predominantly in Communications. Increased revenue generated by OnX and Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset by declines in Consulting in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to one significant customer in-sourcing more work rather than outsourcing it to the Company. Communications revenue experienced growth in 2018 compared to the comparable prior year period. After consideration of revenue of $11.5 million generated from Hawaiian Telcom, Communications revenue increased $6.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This increased revenue is primarily due to customers migrating to newer technologies partially offset by the decline in legacy offerings.\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nCost of services and products is predominantly impacted by fluctuations in the headcount and contractors required to deliver the services within Consulting, Cloud and Communications. The increase of $23.9 million and $88.7 million in cost of services and products for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year is related to the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom and consists primarily of payroll and contract services costs.\nSG&A increased $2.2 million and $53.5 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in 2019 is primarily driven by the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed $9.4 million in 2019 compared to $5.4 million in 2018. The acquisition of OnX contributed an increase of $51.3 million for 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 in addition to the expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom. Increases in SG&A related to the acquisitions in both comparable years were partially offset by lower payroll related costs due to restructuring initiatives executed in 2018 and 2017.\nRestructuring and severance charges of $2.0 million recorded in 2019 are associated with initiatives to reduce and contain costs as well as headcount reductions as a result of insourcing initiatives by one of our significant customers. Restructuring and severance charges of $4.1 million recorded in 2018 are related to costs incurred in order to recognize future synergies as the Company identified efficiencies with the integration of OnX. In addition, a restructuring charge of $0.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with a lease abandonment related to an office space that will no longer be utilized. Restructuring and severance related charges incurred in 2017 related to the reorganization initiated by the Company to better align the segment for future growth.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures are dependent on the timing of success-based projects. Capital expenditures in 2019 were primarily related to projects supporting the Cloud and Communications practices. In addition to success-based projects, the Company incurred $3.9 million in capital expenditures for implementation work associated with internal software projects in 2019.\nCorporate\nCorporate is comprised primarily of general and administrative costs that have not been allocated to the business segments and transaction and integration costs related to acquisition transactions. Corporate costs totaled $35.0 million in 2019, $37.2 million in 2018 and $36.0 million in 2017.\nCorporate costs decreased by $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 as increases in payroll related costs and other general and administrative costs were more than offset by lower transaction and integration costs of $9.7 million. Corporate costs increased in 2018 primarily due to higher transaction and integration costs of $4.0 million partially offset by lower payroll related costs.\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nCapital Investment, Resources and Liquidity\nShort-term view\nOur primary source of cash is generated by operations.

In 2017 and 2018, cash was also utilized to fund merger and acquisition activity.\nCapital expenditures increased $3.2 million and $10.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to incremental capital expenditures contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $69.3 million and $43.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increases were partially offset by reductions in expenditures in the Entertainment and Communications segment in Cincinnati of $16.3 million and $35.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in the prior year due to lower construction costs and installation capital expenditures year over year.\nIn July 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Net proceeds received from the $350 million 8% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2017, combined with a draw on the Revolving Credit and Receivable Facilities in the third quarter of 2018, were utilized to finance in part the cash portion of the merger agreement and the payoff of the Hawaiian Telcom debt of $314.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2017, net proceeds totaling $577.0 million related to the issuance of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 were used to repay the remaining $315.8 million outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2020 as well as the related accrued interest. The remaining proceeds of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 were used to fund the acquisition of OnX that closed in October 2017. The proceeds covered the purchase price, $77.6 million for repayment of outstanding debt, and associated transaction costs.\nInterest payments were $129.3 million, $131.7 million and $65.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest payments decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to payments in 2018 which included $3.5 million of accrued interest related to Hawaiian Telcom. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to additional debt incurred to fund the acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our contractual debt maturities in 2020, including finance lease obligations and other financing arrangements, are $22.7 million and associated contractual interest payments are expected to be approximately $130 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $154.8 million of short-term liquidity, comprised of $11.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $143.0 million of undrawn capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility and $0.2 million available under the Receivables Facility. While we expect to continue to renew the Receivables Facility, we would be required to use cash, our Revolving Credit Facility, or other sources to repay any outstanding balance on the Receivables Facility if it was not renewed.\nThe Company believes that its cash on hand, cash generated from operations and available funding under its credit facilities will be adequate to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nLong-term view, including debt covenants\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $1.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness and an accumulated deficit of $2.8 billion. In addition to the uses of cash described in the Short-term view section above, the Company has to satisfy its long-term debt obligations. The Company has no significant debt maturities until 2024. In addition, we have ongoing obligations to fund our qualified pension plans. Funding requirements for future years are uncertain and will significantly depend on changes in future actuarial assumptions. It is also possible that we will use a portion of our cash flows generated from operations for de-leveraging in the future, including discretionary, opportunistic repurchases of debt prior to the scheduled maturities.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and terminated the then-existing Corporate Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement has financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2019, these ratios and limitations include a maximum consolidated secured total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. The agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated, and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the SEC for more detailed information.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants and ratios.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain of our variable rate debt, including debt under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility, uses LIBOR as one of the benchmarks for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark in 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\nIndentures\nThe Company's Senior Notes are governed by indentures which contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, sell, transfer, lease, or dispose of assets and make investments or merge with another company. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt indentures as of December 31, 2019.\nManagement believes that cash on hand, operating cash flows, its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Facility, and the expectation that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations as they mature and come due, should allow the Company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\nCash Flows\nCash flows from operating activities\nCash provided by operating activities during 2019 was $259.1 million, an increase of $44.4 million compared to 2018. Hawaiian Telcom contributed operating cash flow of approximately $92.0 million in 2019 compared to approximately $18.0 million in 2018. In addition, the increase was due to lower restructuring and transaction and integration payments of $2.1 million and $33.9 million, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by lower tax refunds of $13.2 million for AMT refundable tax credits in 2019 compared to 2018, lower contribution due to loss of GE cloud revenue in 2019 and unfavorable working capital.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2018 was $214.7 million, an increase of $11.3 million compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to contributions from recent acquisitions, lower restructuring payments of $13.0 million compared to 2017, and improved working capital. These increases were partially offset by increased interest payments of $66.0 million and increased payments for transaction and integrations costs of $24.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017.\nCash flows from investing activities\nCash used by investing activities totaled $223.3 million 2019, a decrease of $214.1 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom in 2018.\nCash used by investing activities totaled $437.4 million in 2018, an increase of $200.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. In 2017, cash used for the acquisition of OnX was partially offset by cash provided by the sale of our remaining 2.8 million shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds totalling $140.7 million.\nCash flows from financing activities\nCash used in financing activities was $39.6 million in 2019. In 2019, the Company made debt repayments of $21.5 million related to finance leases and the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024. Additionally, the Company made net debt repayments of $6.1 million related to the Revolving Credit and the Receivables Facilities.\nCash used in financing activities was $158.1 million in 2018. In 2018, the Company borrowed $194.6 million on the Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility. Proceeds were used to partially fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. This increase in cash flow was offset by the repayment of debt of $328.7 million in 2018, which included the payoff of the Hawaiian Telcom debt of $314.7 million.\nCash provided by financing activities was $420.2 million in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company terminated its existing Corporate Credit Agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement that provides for a seven-year $600 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 with proceeds totaling $593 million, net of discounts, and a $200 million Revolving Credit Facility. Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, CB Escrow Corp., an Ohio corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Bell Inc., closed the private offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Notes at par. The proceeds of the note issuance were deposited into an escrow account and subsequently utilized at the time of closing of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Debt repayments totaling $403.0 million related to the repayment of the remaining $315.8 million outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2020, including the related accrued and unpaid interest, as well as $77.6 million paid for OnX outstanding debt at the time of acquisition. Debt issuance costs paid totaled $19.1 million for the year. In addition, the Company repaid $89.5 million on the Receivables Facility in 2017.\nDividends paid on the Company's preferred stock totaled $10.4 million in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFuture Operating Trends\nEntertainment and Communications\nWe continue to mitigate the revenue decline experienced with our Legacy products with increases in revenue of our fiber-based products. In addition, the merger with Hawaiian Telcom has allowed us to build scale and fiber density to help capitalize on the growing demands for internet speeds that only a fiber network can provide. We expect the desire by customers for increased internet speeds will only continue as evidenced by the fact that more than 60% of Cincinnati's internet customers subscribe to speeds of 100 megabits or more, compared to two years ago when less than 30% subscribed to such speeds. As of December 31, 2019, more than 40% of internet customers in Hawaii subscribe to speeds of 100 megabits or more.\nDuring 2020, we expect continued competition for internet, voice and video services as the cable competitor in the Cincinnati market continues to target areas where we have copper and FTTN. Due to this competition, as well as customers migrating to obtaining video programming over broadband Internet connections, we expect to see a decline in video subscribers as well as FTTN and DSL internet subscribers. In the Hawaii market, we also expect continued competition for internet, voice and video services as the cable competitor has increased advertising subsequent to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. In 2020, we plan to invest approximately $100 million for Consumer/SMB Fiber, including construction, installation and value-added services. Our focus for 2020 in both the Cincinnati and Hawaii markets is to identify opportunities to expand our FTTP footprint to residential and commercial addresses with the highest return profile, increase penetration, and drive operational efficiencies. We will take a FTTP internet-based focus due to the increased relevance of this product and the high return profile that it provides. Furthermore, we will apply a similar strategy as we identify opportunities to expand our network footprint in areas outside the Greater Cincinnati market.\nFor our enterprise fiber customers, we expect to continue to see a migration from Legacy products and copper-based technology to higher bandwidth fiber solutions as evidenced by the 15% and 75% increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nIT Services and Hardware\nThe Company's strategy for future growth is to diversify the geographies in which it operates. As a part of executing this strategy, in February 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of SunTel, a regional provider of network security, data connectivity, and unified communications solutions based in Troy, Michigan, and in October 2017 completed the acquisition of OnX, with locations throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. The expectation is that these acquisitions will continue to provide future growth opportunities in the IT Services and Hardware segment by providing additional geographies to operate within, and an expanded customer base in which to sell our products and services. In addition, the acquisitions create synergies and opportunities for cost savings.\nIn 2020, the Company will continue to focus on expanding products and services to our customer base with our full stack of products from simple hardware sales through managed voice and software defined network management, creating contractual recurring revenue streams. We expect budget constraints by certain customers will continue to put pressure on our revenue and operating income in the future, increasing the need to diversify. In addition, as more customers migrate to the public cloud, we will see declines in the demand for Infrastructure products. However, this trend can provide an opportunity in the form of consulting as we have IT professionals that can develop the strategy to guide customers through this migration.\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> < 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt, excluding finance leases and other financing arrangements (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,866.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 200.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,221.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 437.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 597.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 120.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Finance leases (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cancellable operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 363.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 363.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension and postretirement benefits obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrecognized tax benefits (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,165.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 555.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 493.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,469.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 647.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Excludes net unamortized discounts and premiums.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Assumes no early payment of debt in future periods.

We believe that the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles, are adequate in light of the those contingencies that are probable and able to be estimated. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations, and other matters, including the matters discussed below, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of December 31, 2019, cannot be reasonably determined.\nBased on information currently available, consultation with counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, management believes that the eventual outcome of all outstanding claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nIndemnifications\nDuring the normal course of business, the Company makes certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include: (a) intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sale, and/or license of products and services, (b) indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises, (c) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct, (d) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts, and (e) outstanding letters of credit which totaled $10.5 million as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments, and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nOur most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Management views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates or assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. We have discussed our most critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates with our Audit and Finance Committee.\nThe discussion below addresses major judgments used in:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> reviewing the carrying values of goodwill;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> accounting for income taxes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> accounting for pension and postretirement expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReviewing the Carrying Values of Goodwill - The Company adheres to the guidance under ASC 350-20 in testing goodwill for impairment. Under this guidance, the Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment for impairment prior to performing the quantitative tests. A quantitative analysis was performed in 2019 and 2018 and a qualitative analysis was performed in 2017. The Company performs impairment testing of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter when our five-year plan is updated.\nManagement estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of valuation methods, including both income-based and market-based methods. The income-based approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model using projected cash flows derived from the five-year plan, adjusted to reflect market participants' assumptions. Expected future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital applying a market participant approach. The market-based approach utilizes earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies. No goodwill impairment losses were recognized in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nChanges in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the impairment tests for goodwill. The most critical assumptions are projected future growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal values, and discount rate selection and market multiples. These assumptions are subject to change as the Company's long-term plans and strategies are updated each year. As of December 31, 2019, each reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value in the goodwill impairment test.\nWhile none of our reporting units recorded a goodwill impairment in 2019, we determined the IT Services and Hardware is our only reporting unit with material goodwill where the estimated fair value does not substantially exceed the carrying value. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by approximately 23 percent. Total goodwill in this reporting unit is $148.1 million. The goodwill in this reporting unit is primarily attributable to OnX, which was acquired and recorded at fair value in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we did not expect the estimated fair value would exceed the carrying value by a significant amount. We valued this reporting unit using an income approach based on its expected future cash flows and a market approach. The critical assumptions that factored into the valuation are the projected future revenues and EBITDA margins of the business as well as the discount rate used to present value these future cash flows.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Income Taxes - The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. The Company's previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examinations for years prior to 2015.\nThe Company has net operating loss carryforwards at the federal, state and local levels. Federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income in current and future periods. Federal operating loss carryforwards of $125.6 million will expire in 2023 and are not currently limited under U.S. tax laws. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. Based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences, management expects to fully utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods. However, realization of certain state, local and foreign net operating losses, as well as other deferred tax assets, is not certain as changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. A change in ownership, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, could limit the Company's ability to fully utilize existing deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating losses.\nA valuation allowance of $49.3 million and $48.7 million has been recognized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. While the valuation allowance is primarily against state and local net operating losses, it also includes $16.6 million against non-deductible interest and $5.3 million against Texas margin credits which are unlikely to be realized as of December 31, 2019. The valuation allowance included $14.8 million against non-deductible interest and $5.3 million against Texas margin credits as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $21.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. The liability is representative of governmental authorities' interpretation of tax law differing from the Company's interpretation. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $21.7 million. It is reasonably possible that existing unrecognized tax benefits related to a federal sequestration of AMT credits could decrease by $2.1 million within the next 12 months. Accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in interest expense.\nAccounting for Pension and Postretirement Expenses - In accounting for pension and postretirement expenses, we apply ASC 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits.\" A liability has been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the unfunded status of the pension and postretirement plans. Actuarial gains (losses) and prior service costs (benefits) that arise during the period are recognized as a component of \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible management employees, non-management employees, and certain former senior executives. We also provide healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The measurement date for our pension and postretirement obligations is as of December 31. When changes to the plans occur during interim periods, management reviews the changes and determines if a remeasurement is necessary. No amendments to the plan were made during 2019 or 2018.\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations involves significant assumptions and estimates. Each time we remeasure our projected benefit obligations, we reassess the significant assumptions and estimates. The actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans. The most significant of these numerous assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate and\nhealthcare cost trend rates.\nDiscount rate\nA discount rate is used to measure the present value of projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is individually calculated based upon the timing of expected future benefit payments. Our discount rates are derived based upon a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati pension plans was 3.10% and 4.20%, respectively, while the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati postretirement plans was 3.20% and 4.30%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the average discount rate used to value the Hawaii pension plans was 3.10% and 4.20%, respectively, while the average rate used to value the Hawaii postretirement plans was 3.30% and 4.40%, respectively. Lower rates of interest available on high-quality corporate bonds drove the decrease in the discount rates in 2019.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nExpected rate of return\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, developed using the building block approach, is based on the mix of investments held directly by the plans and the current view of expected future returns, which is influenced by historical averages. The required use of an expected versus actual long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated long-term rate of return on the Cincinnati pension plan assets was 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated long-term rate of return on the Hawaii pension plan assets was 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. The long-term rate of return on the Cincinnati and Hawaii postretirement plan assets was estimated to be zero for the disclosed periods as these plans have minimal assets with a low rate of return. Actual asset returns for the Cincinnati pension trusts were gains of 23.90% in 2019 and losses of 7.92% in 2018. Actual asset returns for the Hawaii pension trusts were gains of 18.32% in 2019 and losses of 4.44% in 2018. In our pension calculations, we utilized the market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and consistent manner. Differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of plan assets over five years.\nHealthcare cost trend\nOur healthcare cost trend rate is developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the healthcare cost trend rate used to measure the Cincinnati postretirement health benefit obligations was 6.5%. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the healthcare cost trend rate used to measure the Hawaii postretirement health benefit obligations was 6.8%. As of December 31, 2019, the healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% and 5.0% by the year 2024 and 2026 for the Cincinnati and Hawaii plans, respectively.\nThe actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes. Revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact liabilities, equity, cash flow and other components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expense.\nThe following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the Cincinnati pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Postretirement and Other Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +/- 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($19.9)/$19.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($0.6)/$0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($3.4)/$3.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($0)/$0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +/- 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($1.7)/$1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($0)/$0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Healthcare cost trend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +/- 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($1.4)/$1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($0.1)/$0.1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the Hawaii pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2019:\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Pension Benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Postretirement and Other Benefits\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Decrease)/\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Point\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase in\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Expense\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +/- 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($7.0)/$7.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($0.5)/$0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($2.3)/$2.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($0.1)/$0.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected return on assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +/- 0.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> ($0.7)/$0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Healthcare cost trend rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +/- 1.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/a\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, unrecognized actuarial net losses were $215.3 million and $234.0 million, respectively. The unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by differences between assumed and actual rates of return on invested assets, changes in discount rates and healthcare costs. Because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates, as well as real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, we are not required to recognize these gains and losses in the periods that they occur. Instead, if the gains and losses exceed a 10% corridor defined in the accounting literature, we amortize the excess over the average remaining service life of active employees for the Cincinnati pension plans (approximately 8-11 years) and average remaining life expectancy of retirees for the Cincinnati postretirement plans (approximately 14-17 years). The accumulated gains or losses associated with the Hawaii plans do not exceed the corridor requiring amortization.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRegulatory Matters and Competitive Trends\nFederal - The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"1996 Act\") was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro-competitive, deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans. From 1996 to 2008, federal regulators considered a multitude of proceedings aimed at promoting competition and deregulation. Although the 1996 Act called for a deregulatory framework, the FCC continued to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional ILECs while increasing opportunities for new competitive entrants and new services by applying minimal regulation. Since 2009, federal regulators have devoted considerable attention to initiatives aimed at promoting investment in, and adoption of, advanced telecommunications services, particularly broadband Internet access services. Simultaneously, the FCC has been adopting measures that it believes would promote competition, protect consumers, reform universal service, and enhance public safety and national security. Since January 2017, the FCC has focused on eliminating burdensome and unnecessary regulations that impede broadband investment. We expect this trend to continue, and we will monitor the changing regulatory environment for any potential impacts, particularly on the following proceedings.\nUniversal Service\nThe federal Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") is funded via an assessment on the interstate end-user revenue of all telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers. The assessment is used to support high cost, low income, rural healthcare, and schools and libraries programs.\nIn October 2011, the FCC adopted new rules aimed at controlling the size of the high-cost portion of the fund and transitioning it from supporting legacy circuit-switched networks to broadband. These rules capped the high-cost fund and established a framework for transitioning support to the new Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") to bring broadband to unserved areas. Phase I reforms froze existing high-cost support and provided a mechanism for distributing additional support for qualifying price cap companies. Hawaiian Telcom received $1.4 million in Phase I support and has completed its Phase I buildout. Under Phase II, $1.8 billion of annual support was made available to expand broadband in unserved areas served by price cap ILECs. In August 2015, price cap ILECs, which had the right of first refusal, accepted over $1.5 billion of the annual Phase II support that was available to them. Carriers accepting the Phase II support commitment have the funds available for a six-year period and must complete their commitment by the end of 2020. Cincinnati Bell Telephone ( CBT\u201d) accepted approximately $2 million in annual Phase II support beginning in 2015 in exchange for a commitment to expand broadband to 6,339 Kentucky locations and 745 Ohio locations. Hawaiian Telcom accepted $4.4 million to build to 11,081 locations in Hawaii over the six-year award period.\nIn August 2018, bidding concluded in the FCC's Connect America Fund Phase II auction. Under this reverse auction, up to $2 billion in support over a 10-year period was available to expand fixed broadband service into additional unserved high-cost areas of the country. There were 103 winning bidders and the total amount of support that will be provided to these bidders over the 10-year term is $1.5 billion. Winning bidders must build out their broadband networks within the winning geographic areas (specific census block groups covering 713,176 locations in 45 states) within the first six years of the support term. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom were both winning bidders. As a result, CBT will receive $1.1 million to extend its broadband service to 342 unserved locations and Hawaiian Telcom will receive $18.1 million to build to 3,936 unserved locations. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom auction support distributions began in May 2019 and will continue until May 2029. The build out to all funded auction locations must be completed by December 31, 2025.\nIn January 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order establishing the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund ( RDOF\u201d), which will be used to distribute $20.4 billion over ten years to expand broadband in areas that remain unserved at the conclusion of the CAF II price cap support program. The FCC anticipates distributing $16.0 billion via a reverse auction to be held in late 2020. The remaining $4.4 billion will be distributed via a second auction to be held at a later date when more accurate broadband availability data becomes available. The Order also extended the current price cap CAF II support for an additional year (through 2021). CBT and Hawaiian Telcom have the opportunity to accept the seventh year of CAF II support and will also evaluate whether to bid on any eligible areas in the upcoming RDOF Phase I auction.\nIntercarrier Compensation\nIn October 2011, in conjunction with its reform of the USF high cost support program, the FCC adopted comprehensive reforms to the switched access and reciprocal compensation rules that govern the means by which carriers compensate one another for use of their networks. The end point of the reforms is a bill-and-keep system under which all per-minute intercarrier charges are eliminated.\nTerminating switched access and reciprocal compensation rates were phased out over a six-year period that concluded in 2018 for price cap carriers including CBT and Hawaiian Telcom. The plan contains a mechanism that enables ILECs to recover some of the lost revenue from increased end-user charges, which CBT and Hawaiian Telcom have utilized to the fullest extent possible. The transition and recovery mechanism for originating access and transport rates has not yet been established by the FCC. However, during 2018, the FCC released its proposal for transitioning originating access charges for 8XX calls to bill and keep. Although the public comment period on this proposal has concluded, the FCC has not yet issued a decision. The Company is monitoring this proceeding, but will not know the full impact until the FCC adopts final rules, particularly as it relates to any recovery mechanism to offset proposed rate reductions.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSpecial Access/Business Data Services\nIn 2005, the FCC opened a proceeding to review its Special Access (aka Business Data Services or \"BDS\") pricing rules. Under the rules in effect at that time, special access services were subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap, and ILECs had pricing flexibility in certain metropolitan statistical areas served by a sufficient number of competitors. During 2012, the FCC suspended the grant of any new pricing flexibility requests and issued a mandatory data request. Responses to the data request were provided in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn April 2017, the FCC adopted a Report and Order finding that the market for all packet-based services, Ethernet services, TDM services above the DS3 level, and DS1 and DS3 transport services is competitive in all geographic markets and should no longer be subject to price regulation. Price regulation of TDM services of DS3 or below terminating to end users depends upon the competitive status of the county in which the service is provided. The FCC designated counties as competitive or non-competitive for these TDM end user services based upon historical data submitted by providers and purchasers of BDS in response to a mandatory data request issued in 2012 and supplemented with cable broadband deployment data submitted by providers in the FCC's semi-annual broadband deployment report. Price regulation will be eliminated for these TDM end user services in competitive counties. In non-competitive counties price regulation will continue, although carriers are permitted to offer contract tariffs and volume and term discounts. The Order requires all price cap companies to remove all competitive BDS services from their tariffs by August 2020. The list of competitive and non-competitive counties released by the FCC in May 2017 designated all but two of the counties in the Company's CBT ILEC territory as competitive, and in Hawaii four of the five counties were deemed competitive. In November 2017, Hawaiian Telcom filed an application with the FCC to discontinue offering BDS services in Kalawao County (the non-competitive county). This application was granted in January 2018 and Hawaiian Telcom subsequently filed to detariff all BDS services statewide. At this time, CBT's BDS services remain under tariffs, but those BDS services offered in the competitive counties will be detariffed prior to the 2020 deadline. Nearly all of the Company's current special access revenue is derived from the competitive counties. In August 2018, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the ex ante deregulation of DS1 and DS3 transport services. However, in July 2019, the FCC adopted an Order in response to the remand and reaffirmed its previous conclusion that DS1 and DS3 transport services are competitive nationwide. As a result, price cap carriers must remove these services from their Special Access tariffs by August 1, 2020.\nUnbundled Network Elements\nUnder rules adopted pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ILECs have been required to unbundle the components of their network and provide the unbundled network elements (\"UNE's\") to requesting competitive local exchange carriers at cost-based rates set by state public utility commissions in the 1990's. The rules also required ILECs to resell their voice service to requesting competitive carriers at wholesale rates set by state regulators. In May 2018, USTelecom - The Broadband Association ( USTelecom\u201d) filed a petition with the FCC seeking forbearance from the unbundling and resale rules for all ILECs. On July 10, 2019, the FCC granted the requested forbearance for unbundled DS1 and DS3 transport and on August 2, 2019, it granted forbearance from UNE loop and resale requirements. Specifically, it granted forbearance from the unbundling requirements for DS1 and DS3 transport along routes where competitive fiber is present within a half mile of the ILEC wire center endpoints that trigger the unbundling obligation. As it relates to UNE loops and resale, forbearance was granted for analog voice-grade copper loops and the avoided-cost resale requirements. While Cincinnati Bell's ILECs may benefit from the ability to charge competitive commercially negotiated prices for these facilities and services following the three-year transition period required by the Order, the Company's competitive carrier operations will likely see increased prices for such facilities currently purchased from other ILECs. As a result, the Company is reviewing its current UNE purchases to determine where to transition to commercial agreements for these facilities versus deploying its own facilities and will pursue the most cost effective solution in each market. In November 2019, the FCC opened a new proceeding to consider whether to update the remaining unbundling and resale obligations that apply to ILECs. Specifically, the FCC has proposed eliminating most remaining unbundling obligations with the exception of mass-market broadband-capable loops in rural areas. The Company does not anticipate a decision by the FCC on this in the near-term.\nIP Transition\nIn late 2013, the FCC opened a proceeding to explore how to transition from the legacy circuit-switched TDM networks to Internet Protocol ( IP\u201d) networks. Examination of the myriad of technical, legal and policy issues surrounding the IP transition moved to the forefront during 2014, and during 2015 and 2016, the FCC adopted several orders imposing additional requirements on service providers seeking to transition their networks from copper to fiber. However, during the second quarter of 2017, the FCC opened several proceedings aimed at removing barriers to wireline and wireless broadband deployment and proposed reversing several of the additional requirements imposed in 2015 and 2016. Following this review, in November 2017, the FCC revised its rules to streamline the ILEC copper retirement process and the approval process for discontinuing legacy TDM service to speed the transition from legacy copper-based TDM services to IP services. It also reformed the pole attachment rules to make it easier for providers to attach equipment necessary for next-generation networks. In 2018, the FCC adopted additional changes aimed at streamlining the pole attachment process and preempting state and local processes considered to be detrimental to broadband deployment, particularly the small cells that will be used for 5G networks. The Company does not anticipate any significant financial impact due to these proceedings.\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBroadband Internet Access/Net Neutrality\nIn an order adopted in 2005, the FCC provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband Internet access as a non-regulated information service (comparable treatment to cable modem Internet access at that time) or as a regulated telecommunications service. In 2007, CBT and Hawaiian Telcom elected the non-regulated information service designation for broadband Internet access service. The FCC also ruled that wireless broadband service was a non-regulated information service, placing it on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services such as cable modem service and wireline DSL service.\nIn conjunction with the adoption of the 2005 wireline broadband Internet access order, the FCC adopted a policy statement intended to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable, and accessible to all consumers. In April 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion finding that an FCC enforcement action regarding Comcast's network management practices exceeded the FCC's authority, causing the FCC to reassess its approach to crafting net neutrality rules. In December 2010, the FCC adopted net neutrality rules that required broadband providers to publicly disclose network management practices, restricted them from blocking Internet content and applications, and prohibited fixed broadband providers from engaging in unreasonable discrimination in transmitting traffic. In January 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the net neutrality order's anti-blocking and anti-discrimination requirements finding that they were akin to common carrier regulation. However, the Court upheld the transparency and disclosure requirements and found that the FCC has general authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to promulgate rules to encourage broadband deployment. In response to the Court's decision, the FCC adopted new rules in February 2015 under which it reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. Although these new rules were appealed by numerous parties, in June 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's new rules in their entirety. In November 2016, the FCC adopted an order establishing broadband privacy and security requirements for Internet service providers using its authority under Title II. The restrictive new privacy rules diverged from the Federal Trade Commission framework that had for years set the standard for protecting Internet users' privacy.\nIn March 2017, Congress adopted a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to invalidate the new broadband privacy and security rules approved by the FCC in November 2016. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling restoring the information service classification of broadband Internet access service that existed prior to 2015 and affirmed that broadband consumer protection authority resides with the Federal Trade Commission. An accompanying Report and Order requires that Internet service providers disclose information about their practices relative to blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or affiliated prioritization. The impact of this decision is neutral for the Company.\nRobocalls\nDuring 2019, the FCC took several steps to mitigate the impact of illegal robocalls and spoofed calls on consumers and businesses, including the Chairman calling on the largest voice service providers to voluntarily\u201d adopt the secure telephone identity revisited signature-based handling of asserted information using tokens ( STIR/SHAKEN\u201d) call authentication standards developed by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Standards ( ATIS\u201d). In addition, in December 2019, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act ( Pallone-Thune TRACED Act\u201d). Under the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act, within 18 months, all voice service providers must implement the STIR/SHAKEN framework in their IP networks and take reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework in their non-IP networks. The Company is taking the steps necessary to implement the required call authentication frameworks within the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act timeframes.\nState - Ohio and Kentucky - CBT, the Company's ILEC in Ohio and Kentucky, moved from rate of return regulation to alternative regulation plans for its local services in 1994. These alternative regulation plans restricted CBT's ability to increase the price of basic local service and related services, but eliminated any earnings cap associated with traditional rate of return regulation. Under alternative regulation, price increases and enhanced flexibility for some services partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other, primarily wholesale services.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn Ohio, statutory changes enacted by the Ohio General Assembly in 2005 gave the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ( PUCO\u201d) the authority to provide ILECs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives (House Bill 218). As a result of that legislation, the Company received authority from the PUCO to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in eight of its Ohio exchanges. In September 2010, the Ohio General Assembly passed Substitute Senate Bill 162, which revised state policy concerning the provision of telecommunications service, repealed Ohio's alternative regulation legislation, and authorized additional pricing flexibility for ILEC basic local exchange service ( BLES\u201d - a standalone access line not bundled with other services) upon a competitive showing by the ILEC. CBT filed an application for pricing flexibility under the new rules and, in January 2011, received authority to increase the monthly rate for a standalone local service line throughout its Ohio serving area by $1.25 annually. Nearly all other retail services were removed from rate regulation, including local service lines bundled with other services. Substitute SB 162 also provided cost savings and revenue opportunities resulting from revision of the PUCO's retail rules and service standards beginning in January 2011. In June 2015, House Bill 64 was enacted, which included provisions that could relieve ILECs from their carrier of last resort obligations, pending the outcome of the FCC's IP Transition proceeding. As part of the provisions of HB 64, the PUCO is currently conducting a process that would assist in the identification of BLES customers that might not have a competitive alternative should the ILEC withdraw BLES as part of its transitioning from a circuit-switched TDM network to an IP Network. The 2015 rules have the potential to provide CBT with substantial regulatory relief in Ohio in the future; however, there is no impact in the near-term. Finally, in December 2018, the General Assembly passed House Bill 402 giving ILECs the ability to increase the monthly BLES rate by $2.00 annually. Beginning in 2022, BLES rate regulation will cease entirely in exchanges in which the ILEC demonstrates that it has lost more than 50% of its access lines. The 2018 legislation also limited the PUCO's authority over other aspects of telecom regulation, including eliminating the PUCO's authority to review and approve mergers and acquisitions for telecom companies.\nIn Kentucky, CBT entered into an alternative regulation plan in July 2006 under terms established by the Kentucky General Assembly in House Bill No. 337. Under this plan, BLES prices were capped in exchange for earnings freedom and pricing flexibility on other retail services. The caps on BLES prices expired in July 2011 providing CBT with flexibility to increase rates for basic local exchange service. In March 2015, the General Assembly passed House Bill 152, which removed the Public Service Commission's authority to regulate terms, conditions, rates or availability of any retail service in urban exchanges (greater than 15,000 Households) for a modifying utility. In March 2017, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 10, which extended the same privileges as HB 152 to all exchanges, thus providing CBT with nearly complete deregulation for all retail services in Kentucky.\nHawaii - In Hawaii, the legislature and the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission ( HPUC\u201d) have taken steps over the last decade to reduce rate regulation of some of the services of the Company's Hawaiian Telcom subsidiaries.\nIn 2009 and 2010, the Hawaii State Legislature required the HPUC to treat all intrastate retail telecommunications services, including intrastate toll (i.e., inter island), central exchange (Centrex), most residential and business local exchange services, integrated service digital network (ISDN) private lines and special assemblies, and directory assistance, as fully competitive\u201d under the HPUC's rules with certain qualifications. As a result, HPUC approval and cost support filings were no longer required to establish or reduce rates or to bundle service offerings; however, all service offerings were required to be priced above the service's long run incremental cost and HPUC retained the ability to suspend and investigate any offering. In 2012, the Hawaii State Legislature passed legislation that gave Hawaiian Telcom pricing flexibility to increase tariffed intrastate rates for any retail telecommunications service without approval from the HPUC, with the exception of basic exchange service (i.e., single line residential and single line business services).\nIn May 2019, the Hawaii State Legislature granted nearly full pricing flexibility to telecommunications carriers, including Hawaiian Telcom, for intrastate telecommunications services. Rate changes for retail telecommunications services no longer need to be filed with and approved by the HPUC except for any price increase greater than $6.50 on an annual basis for basic exchange services in counties with a population of less than 500,000. In addition, the traditional cost-of-service regulatory framework that required cost support for retail telecommunications service offerings and pricing above a service's long run incremental cost are no longer applicable; however, the HPUC retains the ability to investigate any offering. The legislation also eliminated the requirements for providers of fully competitive retail telecommunications services to obtain HPUC approval for financing and the sale or encumbrance of regulated property and assets, except when such sale or encumbrance occurs as part of a merger or consolidation with any other public utility. Additional relief was also granted on reporting affiliated transactions and accidents. Based on these regulatory reforms, the Company can now compete more effectively in Hawaii by making decisions based on marketplace dynamics and other economic information.\nCable Franchises - Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana - The states of Ohio and Indiana permit statewide video service authorization. The Company is now authorized by Ohio and Indiana to provide service in its self-described territory with only 10-day notification to the local government entity and other providers.

The discount rate for each plan is individually calculated based upon the timing of expected future benefit payments. Our discount rates are derived based upon a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati pension plans was 3.10% and 4.20%, respectively, while the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati postretirement plans was 3.20% and 4.30%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the average discount rate used to value the Hawaii pension plans was 3.10% and 4.20%, respectively, while the average rate used to value the Hawaii postretirement plans was 3.30% and 4.40%, respectively. Lower rates of interest available on high-quality corporate bonds drove the decrease in the discount rates in 2019.\n\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by

Due to this competition, as well as customers migrating to obtaining video programming over broadband Internet connections, we expect to see a decline in video subscribers as well as FTTN and DSL internet subscribers. In the Hawaii market, we also expect continued competition for internet, voice and video services as the cable competitor has increased advertising subsequent to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. In 2020, we plan to invest approximately $100 million for Consumer/SMB Fiber, including construction, installation and value-added services. Our focus for 2020 in both the Cincinnati and Hawaii markets is to identify opportunities to expand our FTTP footprint to residential and commercial addresses with the highest return profile, increase penetration, and drive operational efficiencies. We will take a FTTP internet-based focus due to the increased relevance of this product and the high return profile that it provides. Furthermore, we will apply a similar strategy as we identify opportunities to expand our network footprint in areas outside the Greater Cincinnati market.\nCincinnati Fioptics and Hawaii Consumer/SMB Fiber (collectively, \"Consumer/SMB Fiber\")\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring and severance related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Entertainment and Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (24.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (89\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IT Services and Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (59\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total restructuring and severance related charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (24.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUsing our experience and expertise, Infrastructure Solutions are tailored to our customers' organizational goals.

incremental revenue from Hawaiian Telcom of $39.4 million and $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Hawaiian Telcom Enterprise Fiber includes revenue from the SEA-US cable, metro-ethernet and dedicated internet access. In addition, enterprise customers are migrating from legacy product offerings to higher bandwidth fiber solutions, as evidenced by the 15% and 16% increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 75% increase in Hawaii in 2019, compared to the comparable periods in the prior year. The increase to revenue from additional customers is offset by pricing pressures. In 2018, the increase in revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom and migration of customers was partially offset due to a one-time project that was completed in the second quarter of 2017 in the amount of $5.4 million.\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nCapital Investment, Resources and Liquidity\nCost of services and products increased in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $80.2 million to cost of services and products in 2018. Excluding the impact associated with the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased by $0.6 million. This decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower payroll costs due to reduced headcount as a result of the restructuring that took place in the first quarter of 2017. Network costs were also down due to a large one-time project recognized in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by higher programming costs resulting from higher rates charged by content providers.\nTransaction and integration costs incurred in 2019, recorded as a Corporate expense, are primarily due to the pending acquisition by Brookfield entered into in the fourth quarter of 2019. Transaction and integration costs incurred in 2018 are due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom that closed in the third quarter of 2018. Transaction and integration costs incurred in 2017 are due to the acquisition of SunTel in the first quarter of 2017, the acquisition of OnX that closed in the fourth quarter of 2017, and costs incurred leading up to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\n \u2022 An IT and/or network security breach or cyber-attack may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data, unauthorized use or publication of our confidential business information and could have a material adverse effect on our business; \nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs. 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2018 vs. 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services and products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Entertainment and Communications\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 384.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 304.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IT Services and Hardware\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 339.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 314.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of services and products\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 784.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 698.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 85.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 531.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 167.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating income in 2019 was $73.1 million, down $10.2 million compared to the same period in 2018.

These alternative regulation plans restricted CBT's ability to increase the price of basic local service and related services, but eliminated any earnings cap associated with traditional rate of return regulation. Under alternative regulation, price increases and enhanced flexibility for some services partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other, primarily wholesale services.\nCommunications solutions help to transform the way our customers do business by connecting employees, customers, and business partners.

Hawaiian Telcom adds 42,900 DSL subscribers and 177,100 voice subscribers to the existing base of subscribers. Increased revenue generated by Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset due to declines in both voice lines and DSL subscribers in Cincinnati. Declines in voice lines and DSL subscribers in 2019 and 2018 have contributed to the declining revenue in both of those years. Voice lines in Cincinnati declined 13% in 2019 compared to 2018, and 14% in 2018 compared to 2017, as the traditional voice lines become less relevant. DSL subscribers in Cincinnati decreased by 11% in 2019 compared to 2018, and 12% in 2018 compared to 2017, as subscribers demand the higher speeds that can be provided by fiber. In addition, declines in DS0, DS1, DS3 and digital trunking have contributed to the revenue decline in both 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year as customers migrate away from these solutions to fiber-based solutions.\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIP Transition\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nWhile none of our reporting units recorded a goodwill impairment in 2019, we determined the IT Services and Hardware is our only reporting unit with material goodwill where the estimated fair value does not substantially exceed the carrying value. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by approximately 23 percent. Total goodwill in this reporting unit is $148.1 million. The goodwill in this reporting unit is primarily attributable to OnX, which was acquired and recorded at fair value in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we did not expect the estimated fair value would exceed the carrying value by a significant amount.

The required use of an expected versus actual long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated long-term rate of return on the Cincinnati pension plan assets was 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated long-term rate of return on the Hawaii pension plan assets was 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. The long-term rate of return on the Cincinnati and Hawaii postretirement plan assets was estimated to be zero for the disclosed periods as these plans have minimal assets with a low rate of return. Actual asset returns for the Cincinnati pension trusts were gains of 23.90% in 2019 and losses of 7.92% in 2018. Actual asset returns for the Hawaii pension trusts were gains of 18.32% in 2019 and losses of 4.44% in 2018. In our pension calculations, we utilized the market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and consistent manner. Differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of plan assets over five years.\n\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-term view, including debt covenants\nA valuation allowance of $49.3 million and $48.7 million has been recognized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Hawaiian Telcom contributed $346.7 million and $175.0 million of revenue in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue growth from the acquisition was partially offset by the decline in Legacy revenue exceeding the growth in revenue from our fiber offerings in Cincinnati as well as the decline of higher margin revenue contributed by General Electric Company ( GE\u201d) of $20.6 million in the Cloud practice. Fioptics revenue in Cincinnati increased $12.0 million while Legacy revenue in Cincinnati decreased $25.1 million in 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.\nTable 99: <table> <tr>

As a result of that legislation, the Company received authority from the PUCO to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in eight of its Ohio exchanges. In September 2010, the Ohio General Assembly passed Substitute Senate Bill 162, which revised state policy concerning the provision of telecommunications service, repealed Ohio's alternative regulation legislation, and authorized additional pricing flexibility for ILEC basic local exchange service ( BLES\u201d - a standalone access line not bundled with other services) upon a competitive showing by the ILEC. CBT filed an application for pricing flexibility under the new rules and, in January 2011, received authority to increase the monthly rate for a standalone local service line throughout its Ohio serving area by $1.25 annually. Nearly all other retail services were removed from rate regulation, including local service lines bundled with other services. Substitute SB 162 also provided cost savings and revenue opportunities resulting from revision of the PUCO's retail rules and service standards beginning in January 2011. In June 2015, House Bill 64 was enacted, which included provisions that could relieve ILECs from their carrier of last resort obligations, pending the outcome of the FCC's IP Transition proceeding. As part of the provisions of HB 64, the PUCO is currently conducting a process that would assist in the identification of BLES customers that might not have a competitive alternative should the ILEC withdraw BLES as part of its transitioning from a circuit-switched TDM network to an IP Network. The 2015 rules have the potential to provide CBT with substantial regulatory relief in Ohio in the future; however, there is no impact in the near-term. Finally, in December 2018, the General Assembly passed House Bill 402 giving ILECs the ability to increase the monthly BLES rate by $2.00 annually. Beginning in 2022, BLES rate regulation will cease entirely in exchanges in which the ILEC demonstrates that it has lost more than 50% of its access lines. The 2018 legislation also limited the PUCO's authority over other aspects of telecom regulation, including eliminating the PUCO's authority to review and approve mergers and acquisitions for telecom companies.\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSpecial Access/Business Data Services\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Entertainment and Communications segment provides products and services that can be categorized as either Fioptics in Cincinnati or Consumer/SMB Fiber in Hawaii (collectively, \"Consumer/SMB Fiber\"), Enterprise Fiber or Legacy. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC (\"CBT\"), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier (\"ILEC\") for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for over 145 years. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC (\"CBET\"), a subsidiary of CBT. On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in the state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of over 135 years as Hawaii's communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii's major islands, except its video service, which currently is only available on the island of Oahu.\nIn April 2017, the FCC adopted a Report and Order finding that the market for all packet-based services, Ethernet services, TDM services above the DS3 level, and DS1 and DS3 transport services is competitive in all geographic markets and should no longer be subject to price regulation. Price regulation of TDM services of DS3 or below terminating to end users depends upon the competitive status of the county in which the service is provided. The FCC designated counties as competitive or non-competitive for these TDM end user services based upon historical data submitted by providers and purchasers of BDS in response to a mandatory data request issued in 2012 and supplemented with cable broadband deployment data submitted by providers in the FCC's semi-annual broadband deployment report. Price regulation will be eliminated for these TDM end user services in competitive counties. In non-competitive counties price regulation will continue, although carriers are permitted to offer contract tariffs and volume and term discounts. The Order requires all price cap companies to remove all competitive BDS services from their tariffs by August 2020. The list of competitive and non-competitive counties released by the FCC in May 2017 designated all but two of the counties in the Company's CBT ILEC territory as competitive, and in Hawaii four of the five counties were deemed competitive. In November 2017, Hawaiian Telcom filed an application with the FCC to discontinue offering BDS services in Kalawao County (the non-competitive county). This application was granted in January 2018 and Hawaiian Telcom subsequently filed to detariff all BDS services statewide. At this time, CBT's BDS services remain under tariffs, but those BDS services offered in the competitive counties will be detariffed prior to the 2020 deadline. Nearly all of the Company's current special access revenue is derived from the competitive counties. In August 2018, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the ex ante deregulation of DS1 and DS3 transport services. However, in July 2019, the FCC adopted an Order in response to the remand and reaffirmed its previous conclusion that DS1 and DS3 transport services are competitive nationwide. As a result, price cap carriers must remove these services from their Special Access tariffs by August 1, 2020.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.

Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nCorporate costs decreased by $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 as increases in payroll related costs and other general and administrative costs were more than offset by lower transaction and integration costs of $9.7 million. Corporate costs increased in 2018 primarily due to higher transaction and integration costs of $4.0 million partially offset by lower payroll related costs.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 The Company operates in highly competitive industries, and customers may not continue to purchase products or services, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share; \n\nThe Merger is expected to close by the end of 2020, although there can be no assurance that the Merger will occur by that date.

Under this reverse auction, up to $2 billion in support over a 10-year period was available to expand fixed broadband service into additional unserved high-cost areas of the country. There were 103 winning bidders and the total amount of support that will be provided to these bidders over the 10-year term is $1.5 billion. Winning bidders must build out their broadband networks within the winning geographic areas (specific census block groups covering 713,176 locations in 45 states) within the first six years of the support term. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom were both winning bidders. As a result, CBT will receive $1.1 million to extend its broadband service to 342 unserved locations and Hawaiian Telcom will receive $18.1 million to build to 3,936 unserved locations. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom auction support distributions began in May 2019 and will continue until May 2029. The build out to all funded auction locations must be completed by December 31, 2025.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nIn May 2019, the Hawaii State Legislature granted nearly full pricing flexibility to telecommunications carriers, including Hawaiian Telcom, for intrastate telecommunications services. Rate changes for retail telecommunications services no longer need to be filed with and approved by the HPUC except for any price increase greater than $6.50 on an annual basis for basic exchange services in counties with a population of less than 500,000. In addition, the traditional cost-of-service regulatory framework that required cost support for retail telecommunications service offerings and pricing above a service's long run incremental cost are no longer applicable; however, the HPUC retains the ability to investigate any offering. The legislation also eliminated the requirements for providers of fully competitive retail telecommunications services to obtain HPUC approval for financing and the sale or encumbrance of regulated property and assets, except when such sale or encumbrance occurs as part of a merger or consolidation with any other public utility. Additional relief was also granted on reporting affiliated transactions and accidents. Based on these regulatory reforms, the Company can now compete more effectively in Hawaii by making decisions based on marketplace dynamics and other economic information.\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn conjunction with the adoption of the 2005 wireline broadband Internet access order, the FCC adopted a policy statement intended to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable, and accessible to all consumers. In April 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion finding that an FCC enforcement action regarding Comcast's network management practices exceeded the FCC's authority, causing the FCC to reassess its approach to crafting net neutrality rules. In December 2010, the FCC adopted net neutrality rules that required broadband providers to publicly disclose network management practices, restricted them from blocking Internet content and applications, and prohibited fixed broadband providers from engaging in unreasonable discrimination in transmitting traffic. In January 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the net neutrality order's anti-blocking and anti-discrimination requirements finding that they were akin to common carrier regulation. However, the Court upheld the transparency and disclosure requirements and found that the FCC has general authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to promulgate rules to encourage broadband deployment. In response to the Court's decision, the FCC adopted new rules in February 2015 under which it reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. Although these new rules were appealed by numerous parties, in June 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's new rules in their entirety. In November 2016, the FCC adopted an order establishing broadband privacy and security requirements for Internet service providers using its authority under Title II. The restrictive new privacy rules diverged from the Federal Trade Commission framework that had for years set the standard for protecting Internet users' privacy.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash used by investing activities totaled $437.4 million in 2018, an increase of $200.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.

This increase in cash flow was offset by the repayment of debt of $328.7 million in 2018, which included the payoff of the Hawaiian Telcom debt of $314.7 million.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Form 10-K Part II\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cincinnati Bell Inc.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Income Taxes - The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. The Company's previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examinations for years prior to 2015.\nCapital expenditures in Cincinnati are incurred to expand our Fioptics product suite, upgrade and increase capacity for our networks, and to extend the life of our fiber and copper networks. The Company is focused on building FTTP addresses, and during 2019, we passed 12,500 FTTP addresses in Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2019, the Company is able to deliver its Fioptics services with speeds up to 30 megabits or more to 623,400 residential and commercial addresses, or 75% of our operating territory in Cincinnati. Cincinnati construction capital expenditures decreased $13.8 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to passing fewer addresses and the timing of capital expenditures, which does not necessarily coincide with the timing of when addresses become available. Cincinnati installation capital expenditures are primarily related to the timing of expenditures for customer premise equipment utilized for installations. In 2019, Cincinnati installation capital expenditures decreased $2.7 million compared to the prior year.\nManagement believes that cash on hand, operating cash flows, its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Facility, and the expectation that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations as they mature and come due, should allow the Company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\n\nSG&A expenses increased $31.1 million in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $31.4 million. In addition, bad debt expense increased related to a reserve for certain receivables with a wholesale customer that filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019, and advertising expense increased due to additional media spending. These increases were offset as the segment continues to focus on cost containment and realizing synergies with Hawaiian Telcom. SG&A expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $32.9 million of SG&A expense in 2018. The increase contributed by Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset by decreased payroll related costs as a result of the restructuring that took place in the first quarter of 2017. Payroll related costs were down $5.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017.\nUnder rules adopted pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ILECs have been required to unbundle the components of their network and provide the unbundled network elements (\"UNE's\") to requesting competitive local exchange carriers at cost-based rates set by state public utility commissions in the 1990's. The rules also required ILECs to resell their voice service to requesting competitive carriers at wholesale rates set by state regulators. In May 2018, USTelecom - The Broadband Association ( USTelecom\u201d) filed a petition with the FCC seeking forbearance from the unbundling and resale rules for all ILECs. On July 10, 2019, the FCC granted the requested forbearance for unbundled DS1 and DS3 transport and on August 2, 2019, it granted forbearance from UNE loop and resale requirements. Specifically, it granted forbearance from the unbundling requirements for DS1 and DS3 transport along routes where competitive fiber is present within a half mile of the ILEC wire center endpoints that trigger the unbundling obligation. As it relates to UNE loops and resale, forbearance was granted for analog voice-grade copper loops and the avoided-cost resale requirements. While Cincinnati Bell's ILECs may benefit from the ability to charge competitive commercially negotiated prices for these facilities and services following the three-year transition period required by the Order, the Company's competitive carrier operations will likely see increased prices for such facilities currently purchased from other ILECs. As a result, the Company is reviewing its current UNE purchases to determine where to transition to commercial agreements for these facilities versus deploying its own facilities and will pursue the most cost effective solution in each market. In November 2019, the FCC opened a new proceeding to consider whether to update the remaining unbundling and resale obligations that apply to ILECs. Specifically, the FCC has proposed eliminating most remaining unbundling obligations with the exception of mass-market broadband-capable loops in rural areas. The Company does not anticipate a decision by the FCC on this in the near-term.\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 The Company's failure to meet performance standards under its agreements could result in customers terminating their relationships with the Company or customers being entitled to receive financial compensation, leading to reduced revenues and/or increased costs; \nRevenue\n \u2022 The future results of the Company will suffer if the Company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom; \n \u2022 The Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2024, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2025 and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the Company; \nThe Company uses federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to defray payment of federal and state tax liabilities. The Company also had significant Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) refundable tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income tax liabilities. The Company made elections on its 2016 and 2017 income tax returns to claim the available portion of these credits in lieu of claiming bonus depreciation. The Company received refunds of AMT credits in the amounts of $14.9 million and $14.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to this matter. The Company also received a refund of $1.7 million in AMT credits in 2019. Remaining AMT credits outstanding total $1.7 million and are expected be refunded by 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased $165.8 million in 2018 compared to the comparable period in 2017. Consulting and Infrastructure Solutions are the main contributors to this revenue increase in 2018, primarily due the acquisition of OnX in the fourth quarter of 2017. OnX contributed $87.2 million in Consulting revenue and $85.0 million in Infrastructure Solutions revenue for the year ended 2018 compared to $19.2 million in Consulting revenue and $27.7 million in Infrastructure Solutions for the year ended 2017. OnX also provided contributions in Cloud revenue, driving the $17.0 million increase in Cloud revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, Hawaiian Telcom contributed $20.0 million in revenue in 2018, predominantly in Communications. Increased revenue generated by OnX and Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset by declines in Consulting in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to one significant customer in-sourcing more work rather than outsourcing it to the Company. Communications revenue experienced growth in 2018 compared to the comparable prior year period. After consideration of revenue of $11.5 million generated from Hawaiian Telcom, Communications revenue increased $6.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This increased revenue is primarily due to customers migrating to newer technologies partially offset by the decline in legacy offerings.\n \u2022 The Company could be subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements; \nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, unrecognized actuarial net losses were $215.3 million and $234.0 million, respectively. The unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by differences between assumed and actual rates of return on invested assets, changes in discount rates and healthcare costs. Because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates, as well as real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, we are not required to recognize these gains and losses in the periods that they occur. Instead, if the gains and losses exceed a 10% corridor defined in the accounting literature, we amortize the excess over the average remaining service life of active employees for the Cincinnati pension plans (approximately 8-11 years) and average remaining life expectancy of retirees for the Cincinnati postretirement plans (approximately 14-17 years). The accumulated gains or losses associated with the Hawaii plans do not exceed the corridor requiring amortization.\n\n*Represents Fioptics in Cincinnati\nIT Services and Hardware, continued\nIn 2009 and 2010, the Hawaii State Legislature required the HPUC to treat all intrastate retail telecommunications services, including intrastate toll (i.e., inter island), central exchange (Centrex), most residential and business local exchange services, integrated service digital network (ISDN) private lines and special assemblies, and directory assistance, as fully competitive\u201d under the HPUC's rules with certain qualifications. As a result, HPUC approval and cost support filings were no longer required to establish or reduce rates or to bundle service offerings; however, all service offerings were required to be priced above the service's long run incremental cost and HPUC retained the ability to suspend and investigate any offering. In 2012, the Hawaii State Legislature passed legislation that gave Hawaiian Telcom pricing flexibility to increase tariffed intrastate rates for any retail telecommunications service without approval from the HPUC, with the exception of basic exchange service (i.e., single line residential and single line business services).\n \u2022 The uncertain economic environment, including uncertainty in the U.S. and world securities markets, could impact the Company's business and financial condition; \n \u2022 The regulation of the Company's businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict its ability to price its products and services, and threaten its operating licenses; \n \u2022 The loss of any of the senior management team or attrition among key sales associates could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; \nEntertainment and Communications SG&A expenses were up in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed SG&A expense of $64.2 million and $32.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. SG&A costs also increased in 2019 compared to the prior year due to an increase in advertising expense and the bad debt reserve for certain receivables with a wholesale customer that filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019 whose collectability remains uncertain. These increases were partially offset as the segment continues to focus on cost containment and realizing synergies with Hawaiian Telcom. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by lower payroll costs in Cincinnati that are a result of headcount reductions from restructuring initiatives that were executed in the first quarter of 2017.\nConsulting services help customers assess their business and technology needs and provide the talent needed to ensure success.

When changes to the plans occur during interim periods, management reviews the changes and determines if a remeasurement is necessary. No amendments to the plan were made during 2019 or 2018.\n\n\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nCincinnati construction capital expenditures decreased $14.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017 even though we passed 38,800 doors in both 2018 and 2017 due to more efficient capital spending. In addition, construction costs incurred for Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") doors totaled $5.5 million in 2017 compared to $1.4 million in 2018. Cincinnati installation capital expenditures decreased $7.3 million for 2018 compared to 2017 due to fewer video and internet activations in 2018. Installation capital expenditures were also impacted by the timing of expenditures for customer premise equipment utilized for installations as well as the Company's implementation of self-installations in Cincinnati which has led to a decrease in the average cost per install.\nEntertainment and Communications costs increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom which contributed costs of $150.9 million and $80.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact associated with the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased $9.9 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in the prior year. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 is due to lower contract services costs and lower payroll related costs due to headcount reductions made during restructuring initiatives that were executed in 2017 and 2018. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to lower payroll related costs resulting from restructuring initiatives which were partially offset by increased video content costs due to higher rates charged by our content providers.\nInterest expense increased in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to interest incurred on the amounts outstanding on the Receivables Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility used to partially fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Interest expense increased in 2018 compared to comparable period in the prior year due to financing transactions that took place during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company entered into the $600.0 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024, issued $350.0 million 8% Senior Notes, and repaid the remaining $315.8 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2020 outstanding under its previous Corporate Credit Agreement with the proceeds from the $600.0 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024.\nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased $16.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased revenue in the Consulting and Communications practices. Consulting revenue increased compared to the prior year due to obtaining significant new customers and projects throughout 2018. Communications revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed $23.9 million of revenue in 2019. In addition, Communications revenue increased as a result of customers migrating to newer technologies which has increased the Company's Hosted UCaaS profiles, NaaS locations and SD-Wan locations. This increase was partially offset by the decline in one-time Communications projects and legacy long distance revenue decline. Cloud revenue decreased compared to the prior year as increased revenue from one-time projects was more than offset by lower revenue contributed by GE of $20.6 million. Infrastructure Solutions revenue also decreased due to a decline in one-time projects and hardware sales.\nContingencies\nConsumer/SMB Fiber products include high-speed internet access, voice lines and video. The Company is able to deliver speeds of up to 30 megabits or more to approximately 75% of Greater Cincinnati and up to 20 megabits or more to approximately 50% of Hawaii's total addressable market.\nhealthcare cost trend rates.\n \u2022 We may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks; \nRestructuring and severance charges recorded in 2019 are related to a severance program for certain management employees as the Company continues its efforts to realize synergies that can be achieved due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Restructuring and severance charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a VSP for certain management employees in Cincinnati as the Company identified efficiencies that can be achieved due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Restructuring and severance charges recorded in 2017 were related to a VSP for certain bargained employees to reduce field and network costs associated with our legacy copper network.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were up in 2019 compared to the prior year due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $47.4 million. Excluding the increase associated with the acquisition, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.4 million due to certain property, plant and equipment reaching the end of its useful life. Depreciation and amortization expenses were up in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom as well as assets placed in service in connection with the expansion of our fiber network in Cincinnati. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $44.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense in 2018.\n \u2022 Maintaining the Company's telecommunications networks requires significant capital expenditures, and the Company's inability or failure to maintain its telecommunications networks could have a material impact on its market share and ability to generate revenue; \n\nEnterprise Fiber\n \u2022 accounting for pension and postretirement expenses. \nCapital Expenditures\nThe increase in IT Services and Hardware depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is due to accelerated depreciation for certain network assets that were determined in the first quarter of 2019 to have a shorter useful life due to a change in customer requirements. Hawaiian Telcom also contributed $3.8 million to depreciation expense in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the SunTel Services LLC (\"SunTel\") and OnX acquisitions, as well as depreciation expense related to acquired property, plant and equipment.\nFederal - The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"1996 Act\") was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro-competitive, deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans. From 1996 to 2008, federal regulators considered a multitude of proceedings aimed at promoting competition and deregulation. Although the 1996 Act called for a deregulatory framework, the FCC continued to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional ILECs while increasing opportunities for new competitive entrants and new services by applying minimal regulation. Since 2009, federal regulators have devoted considerable attention to initiatives aimed at promoting investment in, and adoption of, advanced telecommunications services, particularly broadband Internet access services. Simultaneously, the FCC has been adopting measures that it believes would promote competition, protect consumers, reform universal service, and enhance public safety and national security. Since January 2017, the FCC has focused on eliminating burdensome and unnecessary regulations that impede broadband investment. We expect this trend to continue, and we will monitor the changing regulatory environment for any potential impacts, particularly on the following proceedings.\n (1) Excludes net unamortized discounts and premiums. \n \u2022 Increases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers; \nIn January 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order establishing the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund ( RDOF\u201d), which will be used to distribute $20.4 billion over ten years to expand broadband in areas that remain unserved at the conclusion of the CAF II price cap support program. The FCC anticipates distributing $16.0 billion via a reverse auction to be held in late 2020. The remaining $4.4 billion will be distributed via a second auction to be held at a later date when more accurate broadband availability data becomes available. The Order also extended the current price cap CAF II support for an additional year (through 2021). CBT and Hawaiian Telcom have the opportunity to accept the seventh year of CAF II support and will also evaluate whether to bid on any eligible areas in the upcoming RDOF Phase I auction.\n \u2022 Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the Company's business, financial results and stock price. \nCash provided by operating activities during 2018 was $214.7 million, an increase of $11.3 million compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to contributions from recent acquisitions, lower restructuring payments of $13.0 million compared to 2017, and improved working capital. These increases were partially offset by increased interest payments of $66.0 million and increased payments for transaction and integrations costs of $24.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017.\n*Fiber to the Premise (FTTP), Fiber to the Node (FTTN)\n\nConsumer/SMB Fiber revenue increased by $73.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $42.3 million. The remaining revenue increase was due to increases in the subscriber base for internet and voice, as well as rate favorability across all products in Cincinnati. The internet subscriber base in Cincinnati increased by 5% and the voice subscriber base increased by 2%. The video subscriber base decreased by 5%; however, rate increases mitigated the impact of this decline on revenue. The ARPU on a year-to-date basis increased for internet, voice, and video by 3%, 6% and 6%, respectively, compared to the prior year.\n\nIT Services and Hardware\nShort-term view\n\n\nIn an order adopted in 2005, the FCC provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband Internet access as a non-regulated information service (comparable treatment to cable modem Internet access at that time) or as a regulated telecommunications service. In 2007, CBT and Hawaiian Telcom elected the non-regulated information service designation for broadband Internet access service. The FCC also ruled that wireless broadband service was a non-regulated information service, placing it on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services such as cable modem service and wireline DSL service.\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nEntertainment and Communications revenue increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed revenue of $306.6 million and $155.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In Cincinnati, the growth in Fioptics partially mitigated the decline in Legacy revenue. Fioptics revenue in Cincinnati totaled $353.2 million, $341.2 million and $309.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, up 4% in 2019 and up 10% in 2018 from the comparable prior year.\n \u2022 The Company's debt could limit its ability to fund operations, raise additional capital, and fulfill its obligations, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on its businesses and prospects generally; \nUnbundled Network Elements\nCash Flows\n\nThe amount of these obligations can be expected to change over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.\nThe Company's primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures and debt service. To a lesser extent, cash is also used to fund our pension obligations, retiree medical obligations, and pay preferred stock dividends. In 2017 and 2018, cash was also utilized to fund merger and acquisition activity.\nBroadband Internet Access/Net Neutrality\nThe increases in cost of services and products, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d), and depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily related to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\n (2) Assumes no early payment of debt in future periods. The interest rate applied on variable rate borrowings is the rate in effect as of December 31, 2019. \n (4) Includes amounts under open purchase orders and open blanket purchase orders for purchases of network, IT and telephony equipment, video content, and other goods; contractual obligations for services such as software maintenance and outsourced services; and other purchase commitments. \n\nSegment results described in the Executive Summary and Consolidated Results of Operations section are net of intercompany and intersegment eliminations.\nCost of services and products increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $70.9 million. After considering the impact of the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased by $8.7 million. This decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to decreases in contract services and payroll costs. The decrease in contract services is driven by savings realized associated with the Company's call center. Lower payroll costs are due to reduced headcount and lower overtime. The reduced headcount is a result of the restructuring that took place in the prior two years. Lower overtime is the result of lower video activations as well as the rollout of certain internet installations performed by the consumer.\nRestructuring and severance charges of $2.0 million recorded in 2019 are associated with initiatives to reduce and contain costs as well as headcount reductions as a result of insourcing initiatives by one of our significant customers. Restructuring and severance charges of $4.1 million recorded in 2018 are related to costs incurred in order to recognize future synergies as the Company identified efficiencies with the integration of OnX. In addition, a restructuring charge of $0.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with a lease abandonment related to an office space that will no longer be utilized. Restructuring and severance related charges incurred in 2017 related to the reorganization initiated by the Company to better align the segment for future growth.\n\nCash used by investing activities totaled $223.3 million 2019, a decrease of $214.1 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom in 2018.\nNon-operating expenses (income)\n \u2022 The Company depends on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from its subsidiaries and investments; \nDiscount rate\nIn Kentucky, CBT entered into an alternative regulation plan in July 2006 under terms established by the Kentucky General Assembly in House Bill No. 337. Under this plan, BLES prices were capped in exchange for earnings freedom and pricing flexibility on other retail services. The caps on BLES prices expired in July 2011 providing CBT with flexibility to increase rates for basic local exchange service. In March 2015, the General Assembly passed House Bill 152, which removed the Public Service Commission's authority to regulate terms, conditions, rates or availability of any retail service in urban exchanges (greater than 15,000 Households) for a modifying utility. In March 2017, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 10, which extended the same privileges as HB 152 to all exchanges, thus providing CBT with nearly complete deregulation for all retail services in Kentucky.\nAccounting for Pension and Postretirement Expenses - In accounting for pension and postretirement expenses, we apply ASC 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits.\" A liability has been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the unfunded status of the pension and postretirement plans. Actuarial gains (losses) and prior service costs (benefits) that arise during the period are recognized as a component of \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company manages its business based upon product and service offerings. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we operated two business segments: Entertainment and Communications and IT Services and Hardware. Certain corporate administrative expenses have been allocated to our business segments based upon the nature of the expense and the relative size of the segment. Intercompany transactions between segments have been eliminated.\n\nCloud services include the design, implementation and on-going management of the customer's infrastructure. This includes on-premise, public cloud and private cloud solutions. The Company assists customers with the risk assessment phase through an in-depth understanding of the customer's business as well as building and designing a solution, using either the customer's existing infrastructure or new cloud-based options that transform the way the customer does business.\nCost of services and products is predominantly impacted by fluctuations in the headcount and contractors required to deliver the services within Consulting, Cloud and Communications. The increase of $23.9 million and $88.7 million in cost of services and products for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year is related to the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom and consists primarily of payroll and contract services costs.\nIn late 2013, the FCC opened a proceeding to explore how to transition from the legacy circuit-switched TDM networks to Internet Protocol ( IP\u201d) networks. Examination of the myriad of technical, legal and policy issues surrounding the IP transition moved to the forefront during 2014, and during 2015 and 2016, the FCC adopted several orders imposing additional requirements on service providers seeking to transition their networks from copper to fiber. However, during the second quarter of 2017, the FCC opened several proceedings aimed at removing barriers to wireline and wireless broadband deployment and proposed reversing several of the additional requirements imposed in 2015 and 2016. Following this review, in November 2017, the FCC revised its rules to streamline the ILEC copper retirement process and the approval process for discontinuing legacy TDM service to speed the transition from legacy copper-based TDM services to IP services. It also reformed the pole attachment rules to make it easier for providers to attach equipment necessary for next-generation networks. In 2018, the FCC adopted additional changes aimed at streamlining the pole attachment process and preempting state and local processes considered to be detrimental to broadband deployment, particularly the small cells that will be used for 5G networks. The Company does not anticipate any significant financial impact due to these proceedings.\nIncome tax expense fluctuates based on changes in income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for non-deductible expenses, as well as rate changes. In periods without tax law changes, the Company expects its effective tax rate to exceed statutory rates due to non-deductible expenses. Non-deductible expenses related to the Brookfield transaction were incurred during 2019 in the amount of $11.1 million. Non-deductible expenses related to the acquisitions of Hawaiian Telcom and OnX were incurred during 2018 and 2017 in the amount of $9.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively. In addition, changes in the valuation allowance impact income tax expense. In 2018, a valuation allowance of $14.8 million was established against non-deductible interest, which increased by $1.8 million in 2019. Valuation allowances on state NOLs decreased in 2019 by $2.9 million compared to the prior year.\nOur most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Management views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates or assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. We have discussed our most critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates with our Audit and Finance Committee.\nThe IT Services and Hardware segment provides end-to-end solutions from consulting to implementation to ongoing optimization. These solutions include Cloud, Communications and Consulting services along with the sale and maintenance of major branded Telecom and IT hardware reported as Infrastructure Solutions. These services and products are provided through the Company's subsidiaries in various geographic areas throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. By offering a full range of equipment and strategic services in conjunction with the Company's fiber and copper networks, the IT Services and Hardware segment provides our customers personalized solutions designed to meet their business objectives.\nThe Company has net operating loss carryforwards at the federal, state and local levels. Federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income in current and future periods. Federal operating loss carryforwards of $125.6 million will expire in 2023 and are not currently limited under U.S. tax laws. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. Based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences, management expects to fully utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods. However, realization of certain state, local and foreign net operating losses, as well as other deferred tax assets, is not certain as changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. A change in ownership, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, could limit the Company's ability to fully utilize existing deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating losses.\n\nFor our enterprise fiber customers, we expect to continue to see a migration from Legacy products and copper-based technology to higher bandwidth fiber solutions as evidenced by the 15% and 75% increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement\nCash flows from investing activities\nIn 2020, the Company will continue to focus on expanding products and services to our customer base with our full stack of products from simple hardware sales through managed voice and software defined network management, creating contractual recurring revenue streams. We expect budget constraints by certain customers will continue to put pressure on our revenue and operating income in the future, increasing the need to diversify. In addition, as more customers migrate to the public cloud, we will see declines in the demand for Infrastructure products. However, this trend can provide an opportunity in the form of consulting as we have IT professionals that can develop the strategy to guide customers through this migration.\n \u2022 Failure to anticipate the need for and introduce new products and services or to compete with new technologies may compromise the Company's success in the telecommunications industry; \nLoss before income taxes totaled $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase in the loss of $16.8 million as compared to the comparable period in 2018. In addition to the items impacting operating income, the increased loss before income taxes is primarily due to increased interest expense related to additional debt acquired to fund the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\nLegacy\n \u2022 The Company depends on its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Facility to provide for its short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations, and the availability of those funds may be reduced or limited; \nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants and ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $1.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness and an accumulated deficit of $2.8 billion. In addition to the uses of cash described in the Short-term view section above, the Company has to satisfy its long-term debt obligations. The Company has no significant debt maturities until 2024. In addition, we have ongoing obligations to fund our qualified pension plans. Funding requirements for future years are uncertain and will significantly depend on changes in future actuarial assumptions. It is also possible that we will use a portion of our cash flows generated from operations for de-leveraging in the future, including discretionary, opportunistic repurchases of debt prior to the scheduled maturities.\n \u2022 The Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with, or potential violations of, environmental, health and human safety laws. \nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom which contributed revenue of $40.1 million and $19.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition to the impact of the acquisition, increased revenue from the Communications and Consulting practices was partially offset by lower revenue in the Cloud and Infrastructure Solutions practices. Cloud revenue decline is primarily due to lower revenue contributed by GE of $20.6 million due to GE insourcing certain cloud services. Revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of OnX that closed in the fourth quarter of 2017, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\nOur primary source of cash is generated by operations. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we generated $259.1 million, $214.7 million and $203.4 million, respectively, of cash flows from operations. In 2017, dividends were received from our investment in CyrusOne of $1.1 million and proceeds from the monetization of our CyrusOne investment totaled $140.7 million.\nHawaii construction capital expenditures increased $4.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to building out 5,900 new FTTP addresses in 2019, primarily in rural areas and on the neighbor islands. Hawaii installation capital expenditures increased $1.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year which only includes six months of activity subsequent to the acquisition close date. Enterprise fiber capital in Hawaii is primarily driven by new ethernet customers. Hawaii capital expenditures classified as Other include IT projects, real estate projects, road jobs or plant damage projects, and network upgrades or optimization projects.\nCapital Expenditures\n*Includes Hawaii Hosted UCaaS Profiles\n\nRestructuring and severance charges recorded in 2019 in the Entertainment and Communications segment are primarily related to a severance program for certain management employees as the Company continues its efforts to realize synergies from the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. The IT Services and Hardware segment also recorded restructuring and severance charges in 2019 associated with initiatives to reduce and contain costs as well as headcount reductions as a result of insourcing initiatives by one of our significant customers.\nCapital expenditures increased $3.2 million and $10.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to incremental capital expenditures contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $69.3 million and $43.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increases were partially offset by reductions in expenditures in the Entertainment and Communications segment in Cincinnati of $16.3 million and $35.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in the prior year due to lower construction costs and installation capital expenditures year over year.\nTerminating switched access and reciprocal compensation rates were phased out over a six-year period that concluded in 2018 for price cap carriers including CBT and Hawaiian Telcom. The plan contains a mechanism that enables ILECs to recover some of the lost revenue from increased end-user charges, which CBT and Hawaiian Telcom have utilized to the fullest extent possible. The transition and recovery mechanism for originating access and transport rates has not yet been established by the FCC. However, during 2018, the FCC released its proposal for transitioning originating access charges for 8XX calls to bill and keep. Although the public comment period on this proposal has concluded, the FCC has not yet issued a decision. The Company is monitoring this proceeding, but will not know the full impact until the FCC adopts final rules, particularly as it relates to any recovery mechanism to offset proposed rate reductions.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2019 was $259.1 million, an increase of $44.4 million compared to 2018. Hawaiian Telcom contributed operating cash flow of approximately $92.0 million in 2019 compared to approximately $18.0 million in 2018. In addition, the increase was due to lower restructuring and transaction and integration payments of $2.1 million and $33.9 million, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by lower tax refunds of $13.2 million for AMT refundable tax credits in 2019 compared to 2018, lower contribution due to loss of GE cloud revenue in 2019 and unfavorable working capital.\n \u2022 Weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations; \nDiscussion of Operating Segment Results\nIn July 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Net proceeds received from the $350 million 8% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2017, combined with a draw on the Revolving Credit and Receivable Facilities in the third quarter of 2018, were utilized to finance in part the cash portion of the merger agreement and the payoff of the Hawaiian Telcom debt of $314.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2017, net proceeds totaling $577.0 million related to the issuance of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 were used to repay the remaining $315.8 million outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2020 as well as the related accrued interest. The remaining proceeds of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 were used to fund the acquisition of OnX that closed in October 2017. The proceeds covered the purchase price, $77.6 million for repayment of outstanding debt, and associated transaction costs.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 The Company's future cash flows could be adversely affected if it is unable to fully realize its deferred tax assets; \nThe Company believes that its cash on hand, cash generated from operations and available funding under its credit facilities will be adequate to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nOn January 22, 2020, the Company received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from an infrastructure fund (the Fund\u201d) to acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares for $12.00 per share in cash (the Proposal\u201d). On January 23, 2020, the Company commenced discussions with the Fund regarding the Proposal following the Board of Directors having made the required determinations under the Merger Agreement that allow it to do so. The Board also reaffirmed its recommendation in support of the Merger.\n\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations involves significant assumptions and estimates. Each time we remeasure our projected benefit obligations, we reassess the significant assumptions and estimates. The actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans. The most significant of these numerous assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate and\nBased on information currently available, consultation with counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, management believes that the eventual outcome of all outstanding claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n (7) Includes contractual obligations primarily related to restructuring and employee severance reserves, asset removal obligations, long-term disability obligations, workers compensation liabilities, liabilities related to the pole license agreement obligation, a deferred vendor rebate, and other financing arrangements. \n\n \u2022 The Company's access lines, which generate a significant portion of its cash flows and profits, are decreasing in number. If the Company continues to experience access line losses similar to the past several years, its revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations may be adversely impacted; \nOperating Costs and Expenses\n * Fiber to the Premise (FTTP), Fiber to the Node (FTTN) \n\nWe continue to mitigate the revenue decline experienced with our Legacy products with increases in revenue of our fiber-based products. In addition, the merger with Hawaiian Telcom has allowed us to build scale and fiber density to help capitalize on the growing demands for internet speeds that only a fiber network can provide. We expect the desire by customers for increased internet speeds will only continue as evidenced by the fact that more than 60% of Cincinnati's internet customers subscribe to speeds of 100 megabits or more, compared to two years ago when less than 30% subscribed to such speeds. As of December 31, 2019, more than 40% of internet customers in Hawaii subscribe to speeds of 100 megabits or more.\nThe following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the Cincinnati pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2019:\n\nOther components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expense was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $4.0 million pension settlement charge for the Cincinnati Bell Pension Plan (\"CBPP\") in 2017 as a result of the lump sum payments to CBPP participants exceeding the sum of the service cost and interest cost component of net pension cost for the year.\n\nIn 2005, the FCC opened a proceeding to review its Special Access (aka Business Data Services or \"BDS\") pricing rules. Under the rules in effect at that time, special access services were subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap, and ILECs had pricing flexibility in certain metropolitan statistical areas served by a sufficient number of competitors. During 2012, the FCC suspended the grant of any new pricing flexibility requests and issued a mandatory data request. Responses to the data request were provided in the first quarter of 2015.\nCash flows from operating activities\nUnsolicited Proposal\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward-looking statements regarding future events and results that are subject to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. See \"Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement\" for further information on forward-looking statements.\n\nCorporate is comprised primarily of general and administrative costs that have not been allocated to the business segments and transaction and integration costs related to acquisition transactions. Corporate costs totaled $35.0 million in 2019, $37.2 million in 2018 and $36.0 million in 2017.\nEntertainment and Communications\n \u2022 The Company has incurred, and will incur, substantial direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger. \nDividends paid on the Company's preferred stock totaled $10.4 million in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 The servicing of the Company's indebtedness is dependent on its ability to generate cash, which could be impacted by many factors beyond its control; \nEntertainment and Communications\n*Represents Fioptics in Cincinnati.\n ** Includes units passed for both consumer and business on Oahu and neighbor islands \nRestructuring and severance charges recorded in 2018 are primarily related to continued efforts to realize synergies following the acquisitions of Hawaiian Telcom and OnX. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there was a voluntary severance program (\"VSP\") for certain management employees in the Entertainment and Communications segment as well as Corporate. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company incurred severance costs associated with initiatives to reduce costs in the IT Services and Hardware segment. In addition, a restructuring charge associated with lease abandonment of $0.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to an office space that will no longer be utilized.\n\n\n\nCash flows from financing activities\nReviewing the Carrying Values of Goodwill - The Company adheres to the guidance under ASC 350-20 in testing goodwill for impairment. Under this guidance, the Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment for impairment prior to performing the quantitative tests. A quantitative analysis was performed in 2019 and 2018 and a qualitative analysis was performed in 2017. The Company performs impairment testing of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter when our five-year plan is updated.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and terminated the then-existing Corporate Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement has financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2019, these ratios and limitations include a maximum consolidated secured total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. The agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated, and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the SEC for more detailed information.\nIT Services and Hardware costs increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased payroll and contractor costs associated with resources utilized to support the revenue growth in the Communications and Consulting practices for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition, Hawaiian Telcom contributed $21.9 million and $9.8 million to cost of services and products in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Costs increased in 2018 compared to the prior year comparable period primarily due to expense associated with headcount in place for twelve months in 2018 versus three months in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of OnX.\n \u2022 The proposed Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. \nCorporate\nThe Company's Senior Notes are governed by indentures which contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, sell, transfer, lease, or dispose of assets and make investments or merge with another company. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt indentures as of December 31, 2019.\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nSG&A increased $2.2 million and $53.5 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in 2019 is primarily driven by the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed $9.4 million in 2019 compared to $5.4 million in 2018. The acquisition of OnX contributed an increase of $51.3 million for 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 in addition to the expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom. Increases in SG&A related to the acquisitions in both comparable years were partially offset by lower payroll related costs due to restructuring initiatives executed in 2018 and 2017.\nIT Services and Hardware\nIn October 2011, the FCC adopted new rules aimed at controlling the size of the high-cost portion of the fund and transitioning it from supporting legacy circuit-switched networks to broadband. These rules capped the high-cost fund and established a framework for transitioning support to the new Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") to bring broadband to unserved areas. Phase I reforms froze existing high-cost support and provided a mechanism for distributing additional support for qualifying price cap companies. Hawaiian Telcom received $1.4 million in Phase I support and has completed its Phase I buildout. Under Phase II, $1.8 billion of annual support was made available to expand broadband in unserved areas served by price cap ILECs. In August 2015, price cap ILECs, which had the right of first refusal, accepted over $1.5 billion of the annual Phase II support that was available to them. Carriers accepting the Phase II support commitment have the funds available for a six-year period and must complete their commitment by the end of 2020. Cincinnati Bell Telephone ( CBT\u201d) accepted approximately $2 million in annual Phase II support beginning in 2015 in exchange for a commitment to expand broadband to 6,339 Kentucky locations and 745 Ohio locations. Hawaiian Telcom accepted $4.4 million to build to 11,081 locations in Hawaii over the six-year award period.\nWe are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We believe that the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles, are adequate in light of the those contingencies that are probable and able to be estimated. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations, and other matters, including the matters discussed below, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of December 31, 2019, cannot be reasonably determined.\n \u2022 accounting for income taxes; and \n (6) Includes the portion of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. If the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated for unrecognized tax benefits, these liabilities are included in the \"Thereafter\" column of the table above. \nIndentures\nFuture Operating Trends\n \u2022 One large customer accounts for a significant portion of the Company's accounts receivable. The loss or significant reduction in business from this customer would cause operating results to decline and could negatively impact profitability and cash flows; \nInterest payments were $129.3 million, $131.7 million and $65.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest payments decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to payments in 2018 which included $3.5 million of accrued interest related to Hawaiian Telcom. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to additional debt incurred to fund the acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our contractual debt maturities in 2020, including finance lease obligations and other financing arrangements, are $22.7 million and associated contractual interest payments are expected to be approximately $130 million.\nUniversal Service\nIn March 2017, Congress adopted a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to invalidate the new broadband privacy and security rules approved by the FCC in November 2016. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling restoring the information service classification of broadband Internet access service that existed prior to 2015 and affirmed that broadband consumer protection authority resides with the Federal Trade Commission. An accompanying Report and Order requires that Internet service providers disclose information about their practices relative to blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or affiliated prioritization. The impact of this decision is neutral for the Company.\n\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this nature.\nConsumer/SMB Fiber revenue increased by $56.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $44.9 million. Hawaiian Telcom adds 42,700 video subscribers, 68,200 internet subscribers and 30,000 voice subscribers to the existing base of subscribers. The increase is also a result of the 5% increase in the subscriber base for internet in Cincinnati as we focus our attention on growing the internet FTTP subscriber base. In addition, the Average Revenue Per User ( ARPU\u201d) increased 4% for both internet and video in Cincinnati as compared to the prior year partially offsetting the decline in video subscribers in Cincinnati. ARPU increases are related to price increases for internet and video as well as the change in the mix of subscribers for video.\nHealthcare cost trend\nManagement estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of valuation methods, including both income-based and market-based methods. The income-based approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model using projected cash flows derived from the five-year plan, adjusted to reflect market participants' assumptions. Expected future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital applying a market participant approach. The market-based approach utilizes earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies. No goodwill impairment losses were recognized in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nCertain of our variable rate debt, including debt under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility, uses LIBOR as one of the benchmarks for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark in 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\n\nCorporate SG&A costs increased in 2019 driven largely by higher payroll related costs. In 2018, certain functions previously allocated to Corporate were better aligned with the segment these functions support and expenses allocated to those segments, resulting in lower costs in 2018 compared to 2017.\nCash used in financing activities was $39.6 million in 2019. In 2019, the Company made debt repayments of $21.5 million related to finance leases and the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024. Additionally, the Company made net debt repayments of $6.1 million related to the Revolving Credit and the Receivables Facilities.\n\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\nRevenue\n\nThe Company's strategy for future growth is to diversify the geographies in which it operates. As a part of executing this strategy, in February 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of SunTel, a regional provider of network security, data connectivity, and unified communications solutions based in Troy, Michigan, and in October 2017 completed the acquisition of OnX, with locations throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. The expectation is that these acquisitions will continue to provide future growth opportunities in the IT Services and Hardware segment by providing additional geographies to operate within, and an expanded customer base in which to sell our products and services. In addition, the acquisitions create synergies and opportunities for cost savings.\n (5) Includes payments for Cincinnati and Hawaii Pension and Postretirement Plans as well as other employee retirement agreements. Amounts for 2020 include approximately $8 million expected to be contributed for postretirement benefits. Although the Company expects to continue operating the plans past 2020, its contractual obligation related to postretirement obligations only extends through 2020. Amounts for 2020 through 2026 include approximately $24 million of estimated cash contributions to the qualified pension plans. Expected qualified pension plan contributions are based on current plan design, legislation and current actuarial assumptions. Any changes in plan design, legislation or actuarial assumptions may also affect the expected contribution amount. \nExecutive Summary\nCable Franchises - Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana - The states of Ohio and Indiana permit statewide video service authorization. The Company is now authorized by Ohio and Indiana to provide service in its self-described territory with only 10-day notification to the local government entity and other providers. The authorization can be amended to include additional territory upon notification to the state. A franchise agreement with each local franchising authority is required in Kentucky. The Company has agreements with fifty-three franchising authorities in Kentucky.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $21.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. The liability is representative of governmental authorities' interpretation of tax law differing from the Company's interpretation. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $21.7 million. It is reasonably possible that existing unrecognized tax benefits related to a federal sequestration of AMT credits could decrease by $2.1 million within the next 12 months. Accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in interest expense.\nIT Services and Hardware SG&A costs increased in 2019 compared to the prior year due to additional expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed SG&A costs of $9.4 million and $5.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2019 was partially offset by lower payroll costs resulting from headcount reductions carried out in 2018. SG&A costs were up in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to expense associated with headcount in place for twelve months in 2018 versus three months in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of OnX.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nEnterprise Fiber products include metro-ethernet, dedicated internet access, wavelength, IRU contracts, and wireless backhaul to macro-towers and small cells. As enterprise customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the preferred method of transport due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection.\nEnterprise Fiber capital expenditures in Cincinnati are related to success-based fiber builds, including associated equipment, for enterprise and carrier projects to provide ethernet services. Other capital expenditures are related to IT projects, cable and equipment maintenance and capacity additions, real estate upgrades and maintenance, plus other minor capital purchases.\n\nPending Acquisition by Brookfield\n\n \u2022 Adverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with the Company's employee benefit plans could negatively impact shareowners' deficit and liquidity; \nIndemnifications\nCash provided by financing activities was $420.2 million in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company terminated its existing Corporate Credit Agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement that provides for a seven-year $600 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 with proceeds totaling $593 million, net of discounts, and a $200 million Revolving Credit Facility. Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, CB Escrow Corp., an Ohio corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Bell Inc., closed the private offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Notes at par. The proceeds of the note issuance were deposited into an escrow account and subsequently utilized at the time of closing of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Debt repayments totaling $403.0 million related to the repayment of the remaining $315.8 million outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2020, including the related accrued and unpaid interest, as well as $77.6 million paid for OnX outstanding debt at the time of acquisition. Debt issuance costs paid totaled $19.1 million for the year. In addition, the Company repaid $89.5 million on the Receivables Facility in 2017.\nHawaii - In Hawaii, the legislature and the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission ( HPUC\u201d) have taken steps over the last decade to reduce rate regulation of some of the services of the Company's Hawaiian Telcom subsidiaries.\n \u2022 There are material uncertainties and risks associated with the proposed Merger Agreement and Merger. \n \u2022 The Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue by serving a limited geographic area; \nHawaii - In Hawaii, cable franchises must be approved by the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. Since 2011, the Company's Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. subsidiary has held a cable franchise authorizing it to provide video services throughout the island of Oahu.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements", "item_7_text": "The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes. Revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact liabilities, equity, cash flow and other components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expense.\nRobocalls\n\n \u2022 The Company may be unable to grow our revenues and cash flows despite the initiatives we have implemented; \nA discount rate is used to measure the present value of projected benefit obligations. The discount rate for each plan is individually calculated based upon the timing of expected future benefit payments. Our discount rates are derived based upon a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high-quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati pension plans was 3.10% and 4.20%, respectively, while the average discount rate used to value the Cincinnati postretirement plans was 3.20% and 4.30%, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the average discount rate used to value the Hawaii pension plans was 3.10% and 4.20%, respectively, while the average rate used to value the Hawaii postretirement plans was 3.30% and 4.40%, respectively. Lower rates of interest available on high-quality corporate bonds drove the decrease in the discount rates in 2019.\n\nThe following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the Hawaii pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2019:\n\nIn October 2011, in conjunction with its reform of the USF high cost support program, the FCC adopted comprehensive reforms to the switched access and reciprocal compensation rules that govern the means by which carriers compensate one another for use of their networks. The end point of the reforms is a bill-and-keep system under which all per-minute intercarrier charges are eliminated.\n \u2022 The Company depends on a number of third-party providers and the loss of or problems with one or more of these providers may impede the Company's growth or cause it to lose customers; \nIntercarrier Compensation\nCapital expenditures are dependent on the timing of success-based projects. Capital expenditures in 2019 were primarily related to projects supporting the Cloud and Communications practices. In addition to success-based projects, the Company incurred $3.9 million in capital expenditures for implementation work associated with internal software projects in 2019.\nRefer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further information on recently issued accounting standards.\nDuring 2020, we expect continued competition for internet, voice and video services as the cable competitor in the Cincinnati market continues to target areas where we have copper and FTTN. Due to this competition, as well as customers migrating to obtaining video programming over broadband Internet connections, we expect to see a decline in video subscribers as well as FTTN and DSL internet subscribers. In the Hawaii market, we also expect continued competition for internet, voice and video services as the cable competitor has increased advertising subsequent to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. In 2020, we plan to invest approximately $100 million for Consumer/SMB Fiber, including construction, installation and value-added services. Our focus for 2020 in both the Cincinnati and Hawaii markets is to identify opportunities to expand our FTTP footprint to residential and commercial addresses with the highest return profile, increase penetration, and drive operational efficiencies. We will take a FTTP internet-based focus due to the increased relevance of this product and the high return profile that it provides. Furthermore, we will apply a similar strategy as we identify opportunities to expand our network footprint in areas outside the Greater Cincinnati market.\nCincinnati Fioptics and Hawaii Consumer/SMB Fiber (collectively, \"Consumer/SMB Fiber\")\nUsing our experience and expertise, Infrastructure Solutions are tailored to our customers' organizational goals. We offer a complete portfolio of services that provide customers with efficient and optimized IT solutions that are agile and responsive to their business and are integrated, simplified and manageable. Through consulting with customers, the Company will build a solution using standard manufacturer equipment to meet our customers' specific requirements.\nRegulatory Matters and Competitive Trends\n\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\n\nEnterprise Fiber revenue increased year over year primarily due to incremental revenue from Hawaiian Telcom of $39.4 million and $17.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Hawaiian Telcom Enterprise Fiber includes revenue from the SEA-US cable, metro-ethernet and dedicated internet access. In addition, enterprise customers are migrating from legacy product offerings to higher bandwidth fiber solutions, as evidenced by the 15% and 16% increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and 75% increase in Hawaii in 2019, compared to the comparable periods in the prior year. The increase to revenue from additional customers is offset by pricing pressures. In 2018, the increase in revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom and migration of customers was partially offset due to a one-time project that was completed in the second quarter of 2017 in the amount of $5.4 million.\n\nCapital Investment, Resources and Liquidity\nCost of services and products increased in 2018 compared to the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $80.2 million to cost of services and products in 2018. Excluding the impact associated with the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased by $0.6 million. This decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to lower payroll costs due to reduced headcount as a result of the restructuring that took place in the first quarter of 2017. Network costs were also down due to a large one-time project recognized in the second quarter of 2017. These decreases were partially offset by higher programming costs resulting from higher rates charged by content providers.\nTransaction and integration costs incurred in 2019, recorded as a Corporate expense, are primarily due to the pending acquisition by Brookfield entered into in the fourth quarter of 2019. Transaction and integration costs incurred in 2018 are due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom that closed in the third quarter of 2018. Transaction and integration costs incurred in 2017 are due to the acquisition of SunTel in the first quarter of 2017, the acquisition of OnX that closed in the fourth quarter of 2017, and costs incurred leading up to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\n \u2022 An IT and/or network security breach or cyber-attack may lead to unauthorized use or disabling of our network, theft of customer data, unauthorized use or publication of our confidential business information and could have a material adverse effect on our business; \nOperating income in 2019 was $73.1 million, down $10.2 million compared to the same period in 2018. The revenue contribution from Hawaiian Telcom in addition to the decrease in transaction and integration costs were more than offset by declines in Legacy revenue and increases in cost of services and products, depreciation and amortization and SG&A costs.\nThe discussion below addresses major judgments used in:\n \u2022 A failure of back-office information technology systems could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition; \nOn December 21, 2019, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement\u201d) pursuant to which the Company will be acquired by an affiliate of the Brookfield Infrastructure Group ( Brookfield\u201d), the infrastructure investment division of Brookfield Asset Management (the Merger\u201d). At the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time\u201d), each of our issued and outstanding Common Shares will be converted into the right to receive $10.50 in cash per Common Share, without interest, and the 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares will remain issued and outstanding as 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares of the Company, without par value, following the Effective Time.\nReaders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. The Company does not undertake any obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n \u2022 Negotiations with the providers of content for our video programming may not be successful, potentially resulting in our inability to carry certain programming channels, which could result in the loss of subscribers. In addition, due to the influence of some content providers, we may be forced to pay higher rates for some content, resulting in increased costs; \nThe federal Universal Service Fund (\"USF\") is funded via an assessment on the interstate end-user revenue of all telecommunications carriers and interconnected VoIP providers. The assessment is used to support high cost, low income, rural healthcare, and schools and libraries programs.\nDuring 2019, the FCC took several steps to mitigate the impact of illegal robocalls and spoofed calls on consumers and businesses, including the Chairman calling on the largest voice service providers to voluntarily\u201d adopt the secure telephone identity revisited signature-based handling of asserted information using tokens ( STIR/SHAKEN\u201d) call authentication standards developed by the Alliance for Telecommunications Industry Standards ( ATIS\u201d). In addition, in December 2019, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Pallone-Thune Telephone Robocall Abuse Criminal Enforcement and Deterrence Act ( Pallone-Thune TRACED Act\u201d). Under the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act, within 18 months, all voice service providers must implement the STIR/SHAKEN framework in their IP networks and take reasonable measures to implement an effective call authentication framework in their non-IP networks. The Company is taking the steps necessary to implement the required call authentication frameworks within the Pallone-Thune TRACED Act timeframes.\nState - Ohio and Kentucky - CBT, the Company's ILEC in Ohio and Kentucky, moved from rate of return regulation to alternative regulation plans for its local services in 1994. These alternative regulation plans restricted CBT's ability to increase the price of basic local service and related services, but eliminated any earnings cap associated with traditional rate of return regulation. Under alternative regulation, price increases and enhanced flexibility for some services partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other, primarily wholesale services.\nCommunications solutions help to transform the way our customers do business by connecting employees, customers, and business partners. By upgrading legacy technologies through customized build projects and reducing customer costs, the Company helps to transform the customer's business. These services include Unified Communications as a Service (\"UCaaS\"), Software-Defined Wide Area Network (\"SD-WAN\"), Network as a Service (\"NaaS\"), Contact Center and Collaboration.\nLegacy revenue increased year over year due to incremental revenue from Hawaiian Telcom of $187.4 million and $99.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Hawaiian Telcom adds 42,900 DSL subscribers and 177,100 voice subscribers to the existing base of subscribers. Increased revenue generated by Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset due to declines in both voice lines and DSL subscribers in Cincinnati. Declines in voice lines and DSL subscribers in 2019 and 2018 have contributed to the declining revenue in both of those years. Voice lines in Cincinnati declined 13% in 2019 compared to 2018, and 14% in 2018 compared to 2017, as the traditional voice lines become less relevant. DSL subscribers in Cincinnati decreased by 11% in 2019 compared to 2018, and 12% in 2018 compared to 2017, as subscribers demand the higher speeds that can be provided by fiber. In addition, declines in DS0, DS1, DS3 and digital trunking have contributed to the revenue decline in both 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year as customers migrate away from these solutions to fiber-based solutions.\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nIP Transition\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nWhile none of our reporting units recorded a goodwill impairment in 2019, we determined the IT Services and Hardware is our only reporting unit with material goodwill where the estimated fair value does not substantially exceed the carrying value. The estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount by approximately 23 percent. Total goodwill in this reporting unit is $148.1 million. The goodwill in this reporting unit is primarily attributable to OnX, which was acquired and recorded at fair value in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result, we did not expect the estimated fair value would exceed the carrying value by a significant amount. We valued this reporting unit using an income approach based on its expected future cash flows and a market approach. The critical assumptions that factored into the valuation are the projected future revenues and EBITDA margins of the business as well as the discount rate used to present value these future cash flows.\nChanges in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the impairment tests for goodwill. The most critical assumptions are projected future growth rates, operating margins, capital expenditures, terminal values, and discount rate selection and market multiples. These assumptions are subject to change as the Company's long-term plans and strategies are updated each year. As of December 31, 2019, each reporting unit had a fair value that exceeded its carrying value in the goodwill impairment test.\nIn 2017, restructuring and severance related charges were associated with the Company-initiated reorganizations within both segments of the business that resulted in headcount reductions. The reorganizations were intended to more appropriately align the Company for future growth and reduce field and network costs within our legacy copper network.\nOn July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom Holdco, Inc. (\"Hawaiian Telcom\"). The Unified Communications as a Service (\"UCaaS\"), hardware, and enterprise long distance products and services provided by the Hawaiian Telcom business are included within the IT Services and Hardware segment. The Entertainment and Communications segment includes products delivered by Hawaiian Telcom such as high-speed internet access, digital subscriber lines, ethernet, dedicated internet access, indefeasible right of use (\"IRU\"), video, voice lines, consumer long distance and digital trunking.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, developed using the building block approach, is based on the mix of investments held directly by the plans and the current view of expected future returns, which is influenced by historical averages. The required use of an expected versus actual long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated long-term rate of return on the Cincinnati pension plan assets was 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the estimated long-term rate of return on the Hawaii pension plan assets was 6.50% and 7.00%, respectively. The long-term rate of return on the Cincinnati and Hawaii postretirement plan assets was estimated to be zero for the disclosed periods as these plans have minimal assets with a low rate of return. Actual asset returns for the Cincinnati pension trusts were gains of 23.90% in 2019 and losses of 7.92% in 2018. Actual asset returns for the Hawaii pension trusts were gains of 18.32% in 2019 and losses of 4.44% in 2018. In our pension calculations, we utilized the market-related value of plan assets, which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and consistent manner. Differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market-related value of plan assets over five years.\n\nLong-term view, including debt covenants\nA valuation allowance of $49.3 million and $48.7 million has been recognized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. While the valuation allowance is primarily against state and local net operating losses, it also includes $16.6 million against non-deductible interest and $5.3 million against Texas margin credits which are unlikely to be realized as of December 31, 2019. The valuation allowance included $14.8 million against non-deductible interest and $5.3 million against Texas margin credits as of December 31, 2018.\nThe consummation of the Merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including (i) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least two-thirds of all outstanding Common Shares and 6 3/4% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Shares, voting as a single class; (ii) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended and (iii) the receipt of any required consents or approvals from (a) the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, (b) the Federal Communications Commission, (c) state public service and state public utility commissions, and (d) local regulators in connection with the provision of telecommunications and media services; and (iv) the absence of any legal restraint preventing the consummation of the Merger.\nConsolidated revenue totaled $1,536.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, an increase of $158.5 million compared to the same period in 2018, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $346.7 million and $175.0 million of revenue in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Revenue growth from the acquisition was partially offset by the decline in Legacy revenue exceeding the growth in revenue from our fiber offerings in Cincinnati as well as the decline of higher margin revenue contributed by General Electric Company ( GE\u201d) of $20.6 million in the Cloud practice. Fioptics revenue in Cincinnati increased $12.0 million while Legacy revenue in Cincinnati decreased $25.1 million in 2019 compared to the same period in the prior year.\n (3) Includes finance lease obligations primarily related to vehicles, network equipment used in the deployment of our fiber network, and wireless towers assumed from our discontinued operations. \nDuring the normal course of business, the Company makes certain indemnities, commitments, and guarantees under which it may be required to make payments in relation to certain transactions. These include: (a) intellectual property indemnities to customers in connection with the use, sale, and/or license of products and services, (b) indemnities to customers in connection with losses incurred while performing services on their premises, (c) indemnities to vendors and service providers pertaining to claims based on negligence or willful misconduct, (d) indemnities involving the representations and warranties in certain contracts, and (e) outstanding letters of credit which totaled $10.5 million as of December 31, 2019. In addition, the Company has made contractual commitments to several employees providing for payments upon the occurrence of certain prescribed events. The majority of these indemnities, commitments, and guarantees do not provide for any limitation on the maximum potential for future payments.\n \u2022 The trading price of the Company's common stock may be volatile, and the value of an investment in the Company's common stock may decline; \nOur healthcare cost trend rate is developed based on historical cost data, the near-term outlook and an assessment of likely long-term trends. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the healthcare cost trend rate used to measure the Cincinnati postretirement health benefit obligations was 6.5%. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the healthcare cost trend rate used to measure the Hawaii postretirement health benefit obligations was 6.8%. As of December 31, 2019, the healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decrease gradually to 4.5% and 5.0% by the year 2024 and 2026 for the Cincinnati and Hawaii plans, respectively.\nIn Ohio, statutory changes enacted by the Ohio General Assembly in 2005 gave the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio ( PUCO\u201d) the authority to provide ILECs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives (House Bill 218). As a result of that legislation, the Company received authority from the PUCO to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in eight of its Ohio exchanges. In September 2010, the Ohio General Assembly passed Substitute Senate Bill 162, which revised state policy concerning the provision of telecommunications service, repealed Ohio's alternative regulation legislation, and authorized additional pricing flexibility for ILEC basic local exchange service ( BLES\u201d - a standalone access line not bundled with other services) upon a competitive showing by the ILEC. CBT filed an application for pricing flexibility under the new rules and, in January 2011, received authority to increase the monthly rate for a standalone local service line throughout its Ohio serving area by $1.25 annually. Nearly all other retail services were removed from rate regulation, including local service lines bundled with other services. Substitute SB 162 also provided cost savings and revenue opportunities resulting from revision of the PUCO's retail rules and service standards beginning in January 2011. In June 2015, House Bill 64 was enacted, which included provisions that could relieve ILECs from their carrier of last resort obligations, pending the outcome of the FCC's IP Transition proceeding. As part of the provisions of HB 64, the PUCO is currently conducting a process that would assist in the identification of BLES customers that might not have a competitive alternative should the ILEC withdraw BLES as part of its transitioning from a circuit-switched TDM network to an IP Network. The 2015 rules have the potential to provide CBT with substantial regulatory relief in Ohio in the future; however, there is no impact in the near-term. Finally, in December 2018, the General Assembly passed House Bill 402 giving ILECs the ability to increase the monthly BLES rate by $2.00 annually. Beginning in 2022, BLES rate regulation will cease entirely in exchanges in which the ILEC demonstrates that it has lost more than 50% of its access lines. The 2018 legislation also limited the PUCO's authority over other aspects of telecom regulation, including eliminating the PUCO's authority to review and approve mergers and acquisitions for telecom companies.\nSpecial Access/Business Data Services\nThe Entertainment and Communications segment provides products and services that can be categorized as either Fioptics in Cincinnati or Consumer/SMB Fiber in Hawaii (collectively, \"Consumer/SMB Fiber\"), Enterprise Fiber or Legacy. Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC (\"CBT\"), a subsidiary of the Company, is the incumbent local exchange carrier (\"ILEC\") for a geography that covers a radius of approximately 25 miles around Cincinnati, Ohio, and includes parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern Indiana. CBT has operated in this territory for over 145 years. Voice and data services in the Enterprise Fiber and Legacy categories that are delivered beyond the Company's ILEC territory, particularly in Dayton and Mason, Ohio, are provided through the operations of Cincinnati Bell Extended Territories LLC (\"CBET\"), a subsidiary of CBT. On July 2, 2018, the Company acquired Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom is the ILEC for the State of Hawaii and the largest full service provider of communications services and products in the state. Originally incorporated in Hawaii in 1883 as Mutual Telephone Company, Hawaiian Telcom has a strong heritage of over 135 years as Hawaii's communications carrier. Its services are offered on all of Hawaii's major islands, except its video service, which currently is only available on the island of Oahu.\nIn April 2017, the FCC adopted a Report and Order finding that the market for all packet-based services, Ethernet services, TDM services above the DS3 level, and DS1 and DS3 transport services is competitive in all geographic markets and should no longer be subject to price regulation. Price regulation of TDM services of DS3 or below terminating to end users depends upon the competitive status of the county in which the service is provided. The FCC designated counties as competitive or non-competitive for these TDM end user services based upon historical data submitted by providers and purchasers of BDS in response to a mandatory data request issued in 2012 and supplemented with cable broadband deployment data submitted by providers in the FCC's semi-annual broadband deployment report. Price regulation will be eliminated for these TDM end user services in competitive counties. In non-competitive counties price regulation will continue, although carriers are permitted to offer contract tariffs and volume and term discounts. The Order requires all price cap companies to remove all competitive BDS services from their tariffs by August 2020. The list of competitive and non-competitive counties released by the FCC in May 2017 designated all but two of the counties in the Company's CBT ILEC territory as competitive, and in Hawaii four of the five counties were deemed competitive. In November 2017, Hawaiian Telcom filed an application with the FCC to discontinue offering BDS services in Kalawao County (the non-competitive county). This application was granted in January 2018 and Hawaiian Telcom subsequently filed to detariff all BDS services statewide. At this time, CBT's BDS services remain under tariffs, but those BDS services offered in the competitive counties will be detariffed prior to the 2020 deadline. Nearly all of the Company's current special access revenue is derived from the competitive counties. In August 2018, the US Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit vacated and remanded the ex ante deregulation of DS1 and DS3 transport services. However, in July 2019, the FCC adopted an Order in response to the remand and reaffirmed its previous conclusion that DS1 and DS3 transport services are competitive nationwide. As a result, price cap carriers must remove these services from their Special Access tariffs by August 1, 2020.\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates or judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates or judgments. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, and, as such, have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported.\nCorporate costs decreased by $2.2 million in 2019 compared to 2018 as increases in payroll related costs and other general and administrative costs were more than offset by lower transaction and integration costs of $9.7 million. Corporate costs increased in 2018 primarily due to higher transaction and integration costs of $4.0 million partially offset by lower payroll related costs.\n \u2022 The Company operates in highly competitive industries, and customers may not continue to purchase products or services, which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share; \n\nThe Merger is expected to close by the end of 2020, although there can be no assurance that the Merger will occur by that date. As a result of the Merger, the Company will cease to be a publicly traded company.\n \u2022 If the Company fails to extend or renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements with its labor unions when they expire, or if its unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, the Company's business and operating results could be materially harmed; \nOperating costs\nIn 2017, the Company recognized a gain of $117.7 million on the sale of 2.8 million CyrusOne common shares.\n\n \u2022 Third parties may infringe upon the Company's intellectual property, and the Company may expend significant resources enforcing its rights or suffer competitive injury; \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe increase in Entertainment and Communications depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 and 2018 versus the prior year comparable periods is due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom and the related increase in intangibles and property, plant and equipment.\nIn August 2018, bidding concluded in the FCC's Connect America Fund Phase II auction. Under this reverse auction, up to $2 billion in support over a 10-year period was available to expand fixed broadband service into additional unserved high-cost areas of the country. There were 103 winning bidders and the total amount of support that will be provided to these bidders over the 10-year term is $1.5 billion. Winning bidders must build out their broadband networks within the winning geographic areas (specific census block groups covering 713,176 locations in 45 states) within the first six years of the support term. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom were both winning bidders. As a result, CBT will receive $1.1 million to extend its broadband service to 342 unserved locations and Hawaiian Telcom will receive $18.1 million to build to 3,936 unserved locations. CBT and Hawaiian Telcom auction support distributions began in May 2019 and will continue until May 2029. The build out to all funded auction locations must be completed by December 31, 2025.\n\nIn May 2019, the Hawaii State Legislature granted nearly full pricing flexibility to telecommunications carriers, including Hawaiian Telcom, for intrastate telecommunications services. Rate changes for retail telecommunications services no longer need to be filed with and approved by the HPUC except for any price increase greater than $6.50 on an annual basis for basic exchange services in counties with a population of less than 500,000. In addition, the traditional cost-of-service regulatory framework that required cost support for retail telecommunications service offerings and pricing above a service's long run incremental cost are no longer applicable; however, the HPUC retains the ability to investigate any offering. The legislation also eliminated the requirements for providers of fully competitive retail telecommunications services to obtain HPUC approval for financing and the sale or encumbrance of regulated property and assets, except when such sale or encumbrance occurs as part of a merger or consolidation with any other public utility. Additional relief was also granted on reporting affiliated transactions and accidents. Based on these regulatory reforms, the Company can now compete more effectively in Hawaii by making decisions based on marketplace dynamics and other economic information.\nIn conjunction with the adoption of the 2005 wireline broadband Internet access order, the FCC adopted a policy statement intended to ensure that broadband networks are widely deployed, open, affordable, and accessible to all consumers. In April 2010, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion finding that an FCC enforcement action regarding Comcast's network management practices exceeded the FCC's authority, causing the FCC to reassess its approach to crafting net neutrality rules. In December 2010, the FCC adopted net neutrality rules that required broadband providers to publicly disclose network management practices, restricted them from blocking Internet content and applications, and prohibited fixed broadband providers from engaging in unreasonable discrimination in transmitting traffic. In January 2014, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the net neutrality order's anti-blocking and anti-discrimination requirements finding that they were akin to common carrier regulation. However, the Court upheld the transparency and disclosure requirements and found that the FCC has general authority under Section 706 of the Communications Act to promulgate rules to encourage broadband deployment. In response to the Court's decision, the FCC adopted new rules in February 2015 under which it reclassified broadband Internet access as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. Although these new rules were appealed by numerous parties, in June 2016, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the FCC's new rules in their entirety. In November 2016, the FCC adopted an order establishing broadband privacy and security requirements for Internet service providers using its authority under Title II. The restrictive new privacy rules diverged from the Federal Trade Commission framework that had for years set the standard for protecting Internet users' privacy.\n\nCash used by investing activities totaled $437.4 million in 2018, an increase of $200.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. In 2017, cash used for the acquisition of OnX was partially offset by cash provided by the sale of our remaining 2.8 million shares of CyrusOne Inc. common stock for net proceeds totalling $140.7 million.\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $154.8 million of short-term liquidity, comprised of $11.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $143.0 million of undrawn capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility and $0.2 million available under the Receivables Facility. While we expect to continue to renew the Receivables Facility, we would be required to use cash, our Revolving Credit Facility, or other sources to repay any outstanding balance on the Receivables Facility if it was not renewed.\nCash used in financing activities was $158.1 million in 2018. In 2018, the Company borrowed $194.6 million on the Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility. Proceeds were used to partially fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. This increase in cash flow was offset by the repayment of debt of $328.7 million in 2018, which included the payoff of the Hawaiian Telcom debt of $314.7 million.\nAccounting for Income Taxes - The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction as well as various foreign, state and local jurisdictions. The Company's previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires. With a few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state or local examinations for years prior to 2015.\nCapital expenditures in Cincinnati are incurred to expand our Fioptics product suite, upgrade and increase capacity for our networks, and to extend the life of our fiber and copper networks. The Company is focused on building FTTP addresses, and during 2019, we passed 12,500 FTTP addresses in Cincinnati. As of December 31, 2019, the Company is able to deliver its Fioptics services with speeds up to 30 megabits or more to 623,400 residential and commercial addresses, or 75% of our operating territory in Cincinnati. Cincinnati construction capital expenditures decreased $13.8 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to passing fewer addresses and the timing of capital expenditures, which does not necessarily coincide with the timing of when addresses become available. Cincinnati installation capital expenditures are primarily related to the timing of expenditures for customer premise equipment utilized for installations. In 2019, Cincinnati installation capital expenditures decreased $2.7 million compared to the prior year.\nManagement believes that cash on hand, operating cash flows, its Revolving Credit Facility and its Receivables Facility, and the expectation that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets to refinance debt and other obligations as they mature and come due, should allow the Company to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future.\n\nSG&A expenses increased $31.1 million in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $31.4 million. In addition, bad debt expense increased related to a reserve for certain receivables with a wholesale customer that filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019, and advertising expense increased due to additional media spending. These increases were offset as the segment continues to focus on cost containment and realizing synergies with Hawaiian Telcom. SG&A expenses increased in 2018 compared to 2017 due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $32.9 million of SG&A expense in 2018. The increase contributed by Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset by decreased payroll related costs as a result of the restructuring that took place in the first quarter of 2017. Payroll related costs were down $5.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017.\nUnder rules adopted pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ILECs have been required to unbundle the components of their network and provide the unbundled network elements (\"UNE's\") to requesting competitive local exchange carriers at cost-based rates set by state public utility commissions in the 1990's. The rules also required ILECs to resell their voice service to requesting competitive carriers at wholesale rates set by state regulators. In May 2018, USTelecom - The Broadband Association ( USTelecom\u201d) filed a petition with the FCC seeking forbearance from the unbundling and resale rules for all ILECs. On July 10, 2019, the FCC granted the requested forbearance for unbundled DS1 and DS3 transport and on August 2, 2019, it granted forbearance from UNE loop and resale requirements. Specifically, it granted forbearance from the unbundling requirements for DS1 and DS3 transport along routes where competitive fiber is present within a half mile of the ILEC wire center endpoints that trigger the unbundling obligation. As it relates to UNE loops and resale, forbearance was granted for analog voice-grade copper loops and the avoided-cost resale requirements. While Cincinnati Bell's ILECs may benefit from the ability to charge competitive commercially negotiated prices for these facilities and services following the three-year transition period required by the Order, the Company's competitive carrier operations will likely see increased prices for such facilities currently purchased from other ILECs. As a result, the Company is reviewing its current UNE purchases to determine where to transition to commercial agreements for these facilities versus deploying its own facilities and will pursue the most cost effective solution in each market. In November 2019, the FCC opened a new proceeding to consider whether to update the remaining unbundling and resale obligations that apply to ILECs. Specifically, the FCC has proposed eliminating most remaining unbundling obligations with the exception of mass-market broadband-capable loops in rural areas. The Company does not anticipate a decision by the FCC on this in the near-term.\nItem 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 The Company's failure to meet performance standards under its agreements could result in customers terminating their relationships with the Company or customers being entitled to receive financial compensation, leading to reduced revenues and/or increased costs; \nRevenue\n \u2022 The future results of the Company will suffer if the Company does not effectively manage its expanded operations following the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom; \n \u2022 The Credit Agreement, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2024, the indenture governing the Company's notes due 2025 and other indebtedness impose significant restrictions on the Company; \nThe Company uses federal and state net operating loss carryforwards to defray payment of federal and state tax liabilities. The Company also had significant Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) refundable tax credit carryforwards available to offset future income tax liabilities. The Company made elections on its 2016 and 2017 income tax returns to claim the available portion of these credits in lieu of claiming bonus depreciation. The Company received refunds of AMT credits in the amounts of $14.9 million and $14.8 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to this matter. The Company also received a refund of $1.7 million in AMT credits in 2019. Remaining AMT credits outstanding total $1.7 million and are expected be refunded by 2023.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2019:\nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased $165.8 million in 2018 compared to the comparable period in 2017. Consulting and Infrastructure Solutions are the main contributors to this revenue increase in 2018, primarily due the acquisition of OnX in the fourth quarter of 2017. OnX contributed $87.2 million in Consulting revenue and $85.0 million in Infrastructure Solutions revenue for the year ended 2018 compared to $19.2 million in Consulting revenue and $27.7 million in Infrastructure Solutions for the year ended 2017. OnX also provided contributions in Cloud revenue, driving the $17.0 million increase in Cloud revenue in 2018 as compared to 2017. Additionally, Hawaiian Telcom contributed $20.0 million in revenue in 2018, predominantly in Communications. Increased revenue generated by OnX and Hawaiian Telcom was partially offset by declines in Consulting in 2018 as compared to 2017 due to one significant customer in-sourcing more work rather than outsourcing it to the Company. Communications revenue experienced growth in 2018 compared to the comparable prior year period. After consideration of revenue of $11.5 million generated from Hawaiian Telcom, Communications revenue increased $6.4 million in 2018 compared to 2017. This increased revenue is primarily due to customers migrating to newer technologies partially offset by the decline in legacy offerings.\n \u2022 The Company could be subject to a significant amount of litigation, which could require us to pay significant damages or settlements; \nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, unrecognized actuarial net losses were $215.3 million and $234.0 million, respectively. The unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by differences between assumed and actual rates of return on invested assets, changes in discount rates and healthcare costs. Because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates, as well as real changes in economic values, and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa, we are not required to recognize these gains and losses in the periods that they occur. Instead, if the gains and losses exceed a 10% corridor defined in the accounting literature, we amortize the excess over the average remaining service life of active employees for the Cincinnati pension plans (approximately 8-11 years) and average remaining life expectancy of retirees for the Cincinnati postretirement plans (approximately 14-17 years). The accumulated gains or losses associated with the Hawaii plans do not exceed the corridor requiring amortization.\n\n*Represents Fioptics in Cincinnati\nIT Services and Hardware, continued\nIn 2009 and 2010, the Hawaii State Legislature required the HPUC to treat all intrastate retail telecommunications services, including intrastate toll (i.e., inter island), central exchange (Centrex), most residential and business local exchange services, integrated service digital network (ISDN) private lines and special assemblies, and directory assistance, as fully competitive\u201d under the HPUC's rules with certain qualifications. As a result, HPUC approval and cost support filings were no longer required to establish or reduce rates or to bundle service offerings; however, all service offerings were required to be priced above the service's long run incremental cost and HPUC retained the ability to suspend and investigate any offering. In 2012, the Hawaii State Legislature passed legislation that gave Hawaiian Telcom pricing flexibility to increase tariffed intrastate rates for any retail telecommunications service without approval from the HPUC, with the exception of basic exchange service (i.e., single line residential and single line business services).\n \u2022 The uncertain economic environment, including uncertainty in the U.S. and world securities markets, could impact the Company's business and financial condition; \n \u2022 The regulation of the Company's businesses by federal and state authorities may, among other things, place the Company at a competitive disadvantage, restrict its ability to price its products and services, and threaten its operating licenses; \n \u2022 The loss of any of the senior management team or attrition among key sales associates could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows; \nEntertainment and Communications SG&A expenses were up in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed SG&A expense of $64.2 million and $32.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. SG&A costs also increased in 2019 compared to the prior year due to an increase in advertising expense and the bad debt reserve for certain receivables with a wholesale customer that filed for bankruptcy in the first quarter of 2019 whose collectability remains uncertain. These increases were partially offset as the segment continues to focus on cost containment and realizing synergies with Hawaiian Telcom. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was partially offset by lower payroll costs in Cincinnati that are a result of headcount reductions from restructuring initiatives that were executed in the first quarter of 2017.\nConsulting services help customers assess their business and technology needs and provide the talent needed to ensure success. The Company is a premier provider of application services and IT staffing.\nExpected rate of return\n \u2022 Third parties may claim that the Company is infringing upon their intellectual property, and the Company could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses or be prevented from selling products; \nLegacy products include traditional voice lines, consumer long distance, switched access, digital trunking, DSL, DS0, DS1, DS3 and other value-added services such as caller identification, voicemail, call waiting and call return.\nThis Form 10-K contains \"forward-looking\" statements, as defined in federal securities laws including the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements concerning plans, objectives, goals, future events, future revenues or performance, financing needs, plans or intentions relating to acquisitions and restructuring, business trends, statements regarding the proposed merger with Brookfield Infrastructure (\u2018the merger\u201d) and the expected timetable for completing the merger, are forward-looking statements.

The following important factors, among other things, could cause or contribute to actual results being materially and adversely different from those described or implied by such forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 Changes in tax laws and regulations, and actions by federal, state and local taxing authorities related to the interpretation and application of such tax laws and regulations, could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results and cash flows; \n \u2022 reviewing the carrying values of goodwill; \nThe Company sponsors noncontributory defined benefit pension plans for eligible management employees, non-management employees, and certain former senior executives. We also provide healthcare and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees. The measurement date for our pension and postretirement obligations is as of December 31. When changes to the plans occur during interim periods, management reviews the changes and determines if a remeasurement is necessary. No amendments to the plan were made during 2019 or 2018.\n\n\nOperating Costs and Expenses\nCincinnati construction capital expenditures decreased $14.7 million in 2018 compared to 2017 even though we passed 38,800 doors in both 2018 and 2017 due to more efficient capital spending. In addition, construction costs incurred for Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") doors totaled $5.5 million in 2017 compared to $1.4 million in 2018. Cincinnati installation capital expenditures decreased $7.3 million for 2018 compared to 2017 due to fewer video and internet activations in 2018. Installation capital expenditures were also impacted by the timing of expenditures for customer premise equipment utilized for installations as well as the Company's implementation of self-installations in Cincinnati which has led to a decrease in the average cost per install.\nEntertainment and Communications costs increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom which contributed costs of $150.9 million and $80.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Excluding the impact associated with the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased $9.9 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in the prior year. The decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 is due to lower contract services costs and lower payroll related costs due to headcount reductions made during restructuring initiatives that were executed in 2017 and 2018. The decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to lower payroll related costs resulting from restructuring initiatives which were partially offset by increased video content costs due to higher rates charged by our content providers.\nInterest expense increased in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 primarily due to interest incurred on the amounts outstanding on the Receivables Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility used to partially fund the cash portion of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Interest expense increased in 2018 compared to comparable period in the prior year due to financing transactions that took place during the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company entered into the $600.0 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024, issued $350.0 million 8% Senior Notes, and repaid the remaining $315.8 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2020 outstanding under its previous Corporate Credit Agreement with the proceeds from the $600.0 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024.\nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased $16.5 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased revenue in the Consulting and Communications practices. Consulting revenue increased compared to the prior year due to obtaining significant new customers and projects throughout 2018. Communications revenue increased primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed $23.9 million of revenue in 2019. In addition, Communications revenue increased as a result of customers migrating to newer technologies which has increased the Company's Hosted UCaaS profiles, NaaS locations and SD-Wan locations. This increase was partially offset by the decline in one-time Communications projects and legacy long distance revenue decline. Cloud revenue decreased compared to the prior year as increased revenue from one-time projects was more than offset by lower revenue contributed by GE of $20.6 million. Infrastructure Solutions revenue also decreased due to a decline in one-time projects and hardware sales.\nContingencies\nConsumer/SMB Fiber products include high-speed internet access, voice lines and video. The Company is able to deliver speeds of up to 30 megabits or more to approximately 75% of Greater Cincinnati and up to 20 megabits or more to approximately 50% of Hawaii's total addressable market.\nhealthcare cost trend rates.\n \u2022 We may be liable for the material that content providers distribute over our networks; \nRestructuring and severance charges recorded in 2019 are related to a severance program for certain management employees as the Company continues its efforts to realize synergies that can be achieved due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Restructuring and severance charges were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2018 related to a VSP for certain management employees in Cincinnati as the Company identified efficiencies that can be achieved due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Restructuring and severance charges recorded in 2017 were related to a VSP for certain bargained employees to reduce field and network costs associated with our legacy copper network.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses were up in 2019 compared to the prior year due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $47.4 million. Excluding the increase associated with the acquisition, depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.4 million due to certain property, plant and equipment reaching the end of its useful life. Depreciation and amortization expenses were up in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom as well as assets placed in service in connection with the expansion of our fiber network in Cincinnati. Hawaiian Telcom contributed $44.7 million of depreciation and amortization expense in 2018.\n \u2022 Maintaining the Company's telecommunications networks requires significant capital expenditures, and the Company's inability or failure to maintain its telecommunications networks could have a material impact on its market share and ability to generate revenue; \n\nEnterprise Fiber\n \u2022 accounting for pension and postretirement expenses. \nCapital Expenditures\nThe increase in IT Services and Hardware depreciation and amortization expense in 2019 compared to the same period in 2018 is due to accelerated depreciation for certain network assets that were determined in the first quarter of 2019 to have a shorter useful life due to a change in customer requirements. Hawaiian Telcom also contributed $3.8 million to depreciation expense in the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in 2018 compared to the same period in the prior year is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets acquired as part of the SunTel Services LLC (\"SunTel\") and OnX acquisitions, as well as depreciation expense related to acquired property, plant and equipment.\nFederal - The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (the \"1996 Act\") was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro-competitive, deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all Americans. From 1996 to 2008, federal regulators considered a multitude of proceedings aimed at promoting competition and deregulation. Although the 1996 Act called for a deregulatory framework, the FCC continued to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional ILECs while increasing opportunities for new competitive entrants and new services by applying minimal regulation. Since 2009, federal regulators have devoted considerable attention to initiatives aimed at promoting investment in, and adoption of, advanced telecommunications services, particularly broadband Internet access services. Simultaneously, the FCC has been adopting measures that it believes would promote competition, protect consumers, reform universal service, and enhance public safety and national security. Since January 2017, the FCC has focused on eliminating burdensome and unnecessary regulations that impede broadband investment. We expect this trend to continue, and we will monitor the changing regulatory environment for any potential impacts, particularly on the following proceedings.\n (1) Excludes net unamortized discounts and premiums. \n \u2022 Increases in broadband usage may cause network capacity limitations, resulting in service disruptions or reduced capacity for customers; \nIn January 2020, the FCC adopted a Report and Order establishing the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund ( RDOF\u201d), which will be used to distribute $20.4 billion over ten years to expand broadband in areas that remain unserved at the conclusion of the CAF II price cap support program. The FCC anticipates distributing $16.0 billion via a reverse auction to be held in late 2020. The remaining $4.4 billion will be distributed via a second auction to be held at a later date when more accurate broadband availability data becomes available. The Order also extended the current price cap CAF II support for an additional year (through 2021). CBT and Hawaiian Telcom have the opportunity to accept the seventh year of CAF II support and will also evaluate whether to bid on any eligible areas in the upcoming RDOF Phase I auction.\n \u2022 Failure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the Company's business, financial results and stock price. \nCash provided by operating activities during 2018 was $214.7 million, an increase of $11.3 million compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to contributions from recent acquisitions, lower restructuring payments of $13.0 million compared to 2017, and improved working capital. These increases were partially offset by increased interest payments of $66.0 million and increased payments for transaction and integrations costs of $24.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017.\n*Fiber to the Premise (FTTP), Fiber to the Node (FTTN)\n\nConsumer/SMB Fiber revenue increased by $73.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $42.3 million. The remaining revenue increase was due to increases in the subscriber base for internet and voice, as well as rate favorability across all products in Cincinnati. The internet subscriber base in Cincinnati increased by 5% and the voice subscriber base increased by 2%. The video subscriber base decreased by 5%; however, rate increases mitigated the impact of this decline on revenue. The ARPU on a year-to-date basis increased for internet, voice, and video by 3%, 6% and 6%, respectively, compared to the prior year.\n\nIT Services and Hardware\nShort-term view\n\n\nIn an order adopted in 2005, the FCC provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband Internet access as a non-regulated information service (comparable treatment to cable modem Internet access at that time) or as a regulated telecommunications service. In 2007, CBT and Hawaiian Telcom elected the non-regulated information service designation for broadband Internet access service. The FCC also ruled that wireless broadband service was a non-regulated information service, placing it on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services such as cable modem service and wireline DSL service.\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nEntertainment and Communications revenue increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed revenue of $306.6 million and $155.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In Cincinnati, the growth in Fioptics partially mitigated the decline in Legacy revenue. Fioptics revenue in Cincinnati totaled $353.2 million, $341.2 million and $309.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, up 4% in 2019 and up 10% in 2018 from the comparable prior year.\n \u2022 The Company's debt could limit its ability to fund operations, raise additional capital, and fulfill its obligations, which, in turn, would have a material adverse effect on its businesses and prospects generally; \nUnbundled Network Elements\nCash Flows\n\nThe amount of these obligations can be expected to change over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed, terminated, or modified.\nThe Company's primary uses of cash are for capital expenditures and debt service. To a lesser extent, cash is also used to fund our pension obligations, retiree medical obligations, and pay preferred stock dividends. In 2017 and 2018, cash was also utilized to fund merger and acquisition activity.\nBroadband Internet Access/Net Neutrality\nThe increases in cost of services and products, selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d), and depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily related to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\n (2) Assumes no early payment of debt in future periods. The interest rate applied on variable rate borrowings is the rate in effect as of December 31, 2019. \n (4) Includes amounts under open purchase orders and open blanket purchase orders for purchases of network, IT and telephony equipment, video content, and other goods; contractual obligations for services such as software maintenance and outsourced services; and other purchase commitments. \n\nSegment results described in the Executive Summary and Consolidated Results of Operations section are net of intercompany and intersegment eliminations.\nCost of services and products increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $70.9 million. After considering the impact of the acquisition, costs of services and products decreased by $8.7 million. This decrease in 2019 compared to 2018 is primarily due to decreases in contract services and payroll costs. The decrease in contract services is driven by savings realized associated with the Company's call center. Lower payroll costs are due to reduced headcount and lower overtime. The reduced headcount is a result of the restructuring that took place in the prior two years. Lower overtime is the result of lower video activations as well as the rollout of certain internet installations performed by the consumer.\nRestructuring and severance charges of $2.0 million recorded in 2019 are associated with initiatives to reduce and contain costs as well as headcount reductions as a result of insourcing initiatives by one of our significant customers. Restructuring and severance charges of $4.1 million recorded in 2018 are related to costs incurred in order to recognize future synergies as the Company identified efficiencies with the integration of OnX. In addition, a restructuring charge of $0.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 associated with a lease abandonment related to an office space that will no longer be utilized. Restructuring and severance related charges incurred in 2017 related to the reorganization initiated by the Company to better align the segment for future growth.\n\nCash used by investing activities totaled $223.3 million 2019, a decrease of $214.1 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom in 2018.\nNon-operating expenses (income)\n \u2022 The Company depends on the receipt of dividends or other intercompany transfers from its subsidiaries and investments; \nDiscount rate\nIn Kentucky, CBT entered into an alternative regulation plan in July 2006 under terms established by the Kentucky General Assembly in House Bill No. 337. Under this plan, BLES prices were capped in exchange for earnings freedom and pricing flexibility on other retail services. The caps on BLES prices expired in July 2011 providing CBT with flexibility to increase rates for basic local exchange service. In March 2015, the General Assembly passed House Bill 152, which removed the Public Service Commission's authority to regulate terms, conditions, rates or availability of any retail service in urban exchanges (greater than 15,000 Households) for a modifying utility. In March 2017, the General Assembly passed Senate Bill 10, which extended the same privileges as HB 152 to all exchanges, thus providing CBT with nearly complete deregulation for all retail services in Kentucky.\nAccounting for Pension and Postretirement Expenses - In accounting for pension and postretirement expenses, we apply ASC 715, \"Compensation - Retirement Benefits.\" A liability has been recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the unfunded status of the pension and postretirement plans. Actuarial gains (losses) and prior service costs (benefits) that arise during the period are recognized as a component of \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company manages its business based upon product and service offerings. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we operated two business segments: Entertainment and Communications and IT Services and Hardware. Certain corporate administrative expenses have been allocated to our business segments based upon the nature of the expense and the relative size of the segment. Intercompany transactions between segments have been eliminated.\n\nCloud services include the design, implementation and on-going management of the customer's infrastructure. This includes on-premise, public cloud and private cloud solutions. The Company assists customers with the risk assessment phase through an in-depth understanding of the customer's business as well as building and designing a solution, using either the customer's existing infrastructure or new cloud-based options that transform the way the customer does business.\nCost of services and products is predominantly impacted by fluctuations in the headcount and contractors required to deliver the services within Consulting, Cloud and Communications. The increase of $23.9 million and $88.7 million in cost of services and products for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year is related to the acquisitions of OnX and Hawaiian Telcom and consists primarily of payroll and contract services costs.\nIn late 2013, the FCC opened a proceeding to explore how to transition from the legacy circuit-switched TDM networks to Internet Protocol ( IP\u201d) networks. Examination of the myriad of technical, legal and policy issues surrounding the IP transition moved to the forefront during 2014, and during 2015 and 2016, the FCC adopted several orders imposing additional requirements on service providers seeking to transition their networks from copper to fiber. However, during the second quarter of 2017, the FCC opened several proceedings aimed at removing barriers to wireline and wireless broadband deployment and proposed reversing several of the additional requirements imposed in 2015 and 2016. Following this review, in November 2017, the FCC revised its rules to streamline the ILEC copper retirement process and the approval process for discontinuing legacy TDM service to speed the transition from legacy copper-based TDM services to IP services. It also reformed the pole attachment rules to make it easier for providers to attach equipment necessary for next-generation networks. In 2018, the FCC adopted additional changes aimed at streamlining the pole attachment process and preempting state and local processes considered to be detrimental to broadband deployment, particularly the small cells that will be used for 5G networks. The Company does not anticipate any significant financial impact due to these proceedings.\nIncome tax expense fluctuates based on changes in income from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted for non-deductible expenses, as well as rate changes. In periods without tax law changes, the Company expects its effective tax rate to exceed statutory rates due to non-deductible expenses. Non-deductible expenses related to the Brookfield transaction were incurred during 2019 in the amount of $11.1 million. Non-deductible expenses related to the acquisitions of Hawaiian Telcom and OnX were incurred during 2018 and 2017 in the amount of $9.0 million and $10.4 million, respectively. In addition, changes in the valuation allowance impact income tax expense. In 2018, a valuation allowance of $14.8 million was established against non-deductible interest, which increased by $1.8 million in 2019. Valuation allowances on state NOLs decreased in 2019 by $2.9 million compared to the prior year.\nOur most significant accounting policies are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Management views critical accounting policies to be those policies that are highly dependent on subjective or complex judgments, estimates or assumptions, and where changes in those estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on the consolidated financial statements. We have discussed our most critical accounting policies, judgments and estimates with our Audit and Finance Committee.\nThe IT Services and Hardware segment provides end-to-end solutions from consulting to implementation to ongoing optimization. These solutions include Cloud, Communications and Consulting services along with the sale and maintenance of major branded Telecom and IT hardware reported as Infrastructure Solutions. These services and products are provided through the Company's subsidiaries in various geographic areas throughout the United States, Canada and Europe. By offering a full range of equipment and strategic services in conjunction with the Company's fiber and copper networks, the IT Services and Hardware segment provides our customers personalized solutions designed to meet their business objectives.\nThe Company has net operating loss carryforwards at the federal, state and local levels. Federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income in current and future periods. Federal operating loss carryforwards of $125.6 million will expire in 2023 and are not currently limited under U.S. tax laws. The ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon our ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards. Based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences, management expects to fully utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods. However, realization of certain state, local and foreign net operating losses, as well as other deferred tax assets, is not certain as changes in our current estimates, due to unanticipated market conditions, governmental legislative actions or events, could have a material effect on our ability to utilize deferred tax assets. A change in ownership, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code, could limit the Company's ability to fully utilize existing deferred tax assets related to federal and state net operating losses.\n\nFor our enterprise fiber customers, we expect to continue to see a migration from Legacy products and copper-based technology to higher bandwidth fiber solutions as evidenced by the 15% and 75% increases in Ethernet Bandwidth in Cincinnati and Hawaii, respectively, in 2019 compared to 2018.\nPrivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement\nCash flows from investing activities\nIn 2020, the Company will continue to focus on expanding products and services to our customer base with our full stack of products from simple hardware sales through managed voice and software defined network management, creating contractual recurring revenue streams. We expect budget constraints by certain customers will continue to put pressure on our revenue and operating income in the future, increasing the need to diversify. In addition, as more customers migrate to the public cloud, we will see declines in the demand for Infrastructure products. However, this trend can provide an opportunity in the form of consulting as we have IT professionals that can develop the strategy to guide customers through this migration.\n \u2022 Failure to anticipate the need for and introduce new products and services or to compete with new technologies may compromise the Company's success in the telecommunications industry; \nLoss before income taxes totaled $77.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in an increase in the loss of $16.8 million as compared to the comparable period in 2018. In addition to the items impacting operating income, the increased loss before income taxes is primarily due to increased interest expense related to additional debt acquired to fund the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\nLegacy\n \u2022 The Company depends on its Revolving Credit Facility and Receivables Facility to provide for its short-term financing requirements in excess of amounts generated by operations, and the availability of those funds may be reduced or limited; \nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with the Credit Agreement covenants and ratios.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $1.9 billion of outstanding indebtedness and an accumulated deficit of $2.8 billion. In addition to the uses of cash described in the Short-term view section above, the Company has to satisfy its long-term debt obligations. The Company has no significant debt maturities until 2024. In addition, we have ongoing obligations to fund our qualified pension plans. Funding requirements for future years are uncertain and will significantly depend on changes in future actuarial assumptions. It is also possible that we will use a portion of our cash flows generated from operations for de-leveraging in the future, including discretionary, opportunistic repurchases of debt prior to the scheduled maturities.\n \u2022 The Company could incur significant costs resulting from complying with, or potential violations of, environmental, health and human safety laws. \nIT Services and Hardware revenue increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom which contributed revenue of $40.1 million and $19.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. In addition to the impact of the acquisition, increased revenue from the Communications and Consulting practices was partially offset by lower revenue in the Cloud and Infrastructure Solutions practices. Cloud revenue decline is primarily due to lower revenue contributed by GE of $20.6 million due to GE insourcing certain cloud services. Revenue increased in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to the acquisition of OnX that closed in the fourth quarter of 2017, and to a lesser extent, the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom.\nOur primary source of cash is generated by operations. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we generated $259.1 million, $214.7 million and $203.4 million, respectively, of cash flows from operations. In 2017, dividends were received from our investment in CyrusOne of $1.1 million and proceeds from the monetization of our CyrusOne investment totaled $140.7 million.\nHawaii construction capital expenditures increased $4.3 million in 2019 compared to 2018 due to building out 5,900 new FTTP addresses in 2019, primarily in rural areas and on the neighbor islands. Hawaii installation capital expenditures increased $1.8 million compared to the same period in the prior year which only includes six months of activity subsequent to the acquisition close date. Enterprise fiber capital in Hawaii is primarily driven by new ethernet customers. Hawaii capital expenditures classified as Other include IT projects, real estate projects, road jobs or plant damage projects, and network upgrades or optimization projects.\nCapital Expenditures\n*Includes Hawaii Hosted UCaaS Profiles\n\nRestructuring and severance charges recorded in 2019 in the Entertainment and Communications segment are primarily related to a severance program for certain management employees as the Company continues its efforts to realize synergies from the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. The IT Services and Hardware segment also recorded restructuring and severance charges in 2019 associated with initiatives to reduce and contain costs as well as headcount reductions as a result of insourcing initiatives by one of our significant customers.\nCapital expenditures increased $3.2 million and $10.1 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year primarily due to incremental capital expenditures contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $69.3 million and $43.8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increases were partially offset by reductions in expenditures in the Entertainment and Communications segment in Cincinnati of $16.3 million and $35.0 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the comparable periods in the prior year due to lower construction costs and installation capital expenditures year over year.\nTerminating switched access and reciprocal compensation rates were phased out over a six-year period that concluded in 2018 for price cap carriers including CBT and Hawaiian Telcom. The plan contains a mechanism that enables ILECs to recover some of the lost revenue from increased end-user charges, which CBT and Hawaiian Telcom have utilized to the fullest extent possible. The transition and recovery mechanism for originating access and transport rates has not yet been established by the FCC. However, during 2018, the FCC released its proposal for transitioning originating access charges for 8XX calls to bill and keep. Although the public comment period on this proposal has concluded, the FCC has not yet issued a decision. The Company is monitoring this proceeding, but will not know the full impact until the FCC adopts final rules, particularly as it relates to any recovery mechanism to offset proposed rate reductions.\nCash provided by operating activities during 2019 was $259.1 million, an increase of $44.4 million compared to 2018. Hawaiian Telcom contributed operating cash flow of approximately $92.0 million in 2019 compared to approximately $18.0 million in 2018. In addition, the increase was due to lower restructuring and transaction and integration payments of $2.1 million and $33.9 million, respectively, compared to 2018. These increases were partially offset by lower tax refunds of $13.2 million for AMT refundable tax credits in 2019 compared to 2018, lower contribution due to loss of GE cloud revenue in 2019 and unfavorable working capital.\n \u2022 Weather conditions, natural disasters, terrorist acts or acts of war could cause damage to our infrastructure and result in significant disruptions to our operations; \nDiscussion of Operating Segment Results\nIn July 2018, the Company completed the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Net proceeds received from the $350 million 8% Senior Notes in the fourth quarter of 2017, combined with a draw on the Revolving Credit and Receivable Facilities in the third quarter of 2018, were utilized to finance in part the cash portion of the merger agreement and the payoff of the Hawaiian Telcom debt of $314.7 million. In the fourth quarter of 2017, net proceeds totaling $577.0 million related to the issuance of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 were used to repay the remaining $315.8 million outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2020 as well as the related accrued interest. The remaining proceeds of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 were used to fund the acquisition of OnX that closed in October 2017. The proceeds covered the purchase price, $77.6 million for repayment of outstanding debt, and associated transaction costs.\nContractual Obligations\n \u2022 The Company's future cash flows could be adversely affected if it is unable to fully realize its deferred tax assets; \nThe Company believes that its cash on hand, cash generated from operations and available funding under its credit facilities will be adequate to meet its cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nOn January 22, 2020, the Company received an unsolicited, non-binding proposal from an infrastructure fund (the Fund\u201d) to acquire all of the outstanding Common Shares for $12.00 per share in cash (the Proposal\u201d). On January 23, 2020, the Company commenced discussions with the Fund regarding the Proposal following the Board of Directors having made the required determinations under the Merger Agreement that allow it to do so. The Board also reaffirmed its recommendation in support of the Merger.\n\nThe measurement of our pension and postretirement projected benefit obligations involves significant assumptions and estimates. Each time we remeasure our projected benefit obligations, we reassess the significant assumptions and estimates. The actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans. The most significant of these numerous assumptions, which are reviewed annually, include the discount rate and\nBased on information currently available, consultation with counsel, available insurance coverage and established reserves, management believes that the eventual outcome of all outstanding claims will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material effect on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n (7) Includes contractual obligations primarily related to restructuring and employee severance reserves, asset removal obligations, long-term disability obligations, workers compensation liabilities, liabilities related to the pole license agreement obligation, a deferred vendor rebate, and other financing arrangements. \n\n \u2022 The Company's access lines, which generate a significant portion of its cash flows and profits, are decreasing in number. If the Company continues to experience access line losses similar to the past several years, its revenues, earnings and cash flows from operations may be adversely impacted; \nOperating Costs and Expenses\n * Fiber to the Premise (FTTP), Fiber to the Node (FTTN) \n\nWe continue to mitigate the revenue decline experienced with our Legacy products with increases in revenue of our fiber-based products. In addition, the merger with Hawaiian Telcom has allowed us to build scale and fiber density to help capitalize on the growing demands for internet speeds that only a fiber network can provide. We expect the desire by customers for increased internet speeds will only continue as evidenced by the fact that more than 60% of Cincinnati's internet customers subscribe to speeds of 100 megabits or more, compared to two years ago when less than 30% subscribed to such speeds. As of December 31, 2019, more than 40% of internet customers in Hawaii subscribe to speeds of 100 megabits or more.\nThe following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the Cincinnati pension and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2019:\n\nOther components of pension and postretirement benefit plans expense was lower in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to a $4.0 million pension settlement charge for the Cincinnati Bell Pension Plan (\"CBPP\") in 2017 as a result of the lump sum payments to CBPP participants exceeding the sum of the service cost and interest cost component of net pension cost for the year.\n\nIn 2005, the FCC opened a proceeding to review its Special Access (aka Business Data Services or \"BDS\") pricing rules. Under the rules in effect at that time, special access services were subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap, and ILECs had pricing flexibility in certain metropolitan statistical areas served by a sufficient number of competitors. During 2012, the FCC suspended the grant of any new pricing flexibility requests and issued a mandatory data request. Responses to the data request were provided in the first quarter of 2015.\nCash flows from operating activities\nUnsolicited Proposal\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated by reference herein contain forward-looking statements regarding future events and results that are subject to the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements, other than statements of historical facts, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements. See \"Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 Safe Harbor Cautionary Statement\" for further information on forward-looking statements.\n\nCorporate is comprised primarily of general and administrative costs that have not been allocated to the business segments and transaction and integration costs related to acquisition transactions. Corporate costs totaled $35.0 million in 2019, $37.2 million in 2018 and $36.0 million in 2017.\nEntertainment and Communications\n \u2022 The Company has incurred, and will incur, substantial direct and indirect costs as a result of the Merger. \nDividends paid on the Company's preferred stock totaled $10.4 million in each of 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 The servicing of the Company's indebtedness is dependent on its ability to generate cash, which could be impacted by many factors beyond its control; \nEntertainment and Communications\n*Represents Fioptics in Cincinnati.\n ** Includes units passed for both consumer and business on Oahu and neighbor islands \nRestructuring and severance charges recorded in 2018 are primarily related to continued efforts to realize synergies following the acquisitions of Hawaiian Telcom and OnX. In the fourth quarter of 2018, there was a voluntary severance program (\"VSP\") for certain management employees in the Entertainment and Communications segment as well as Corporate. In the second quarter of 2018, the Company incurred severance costs associated with initiatives to reduce costs in the IT Services and Hardware segment. In addition, a restructuring charge associated with lease abandonment of $0.8 million was recorded in the second quarter of 2018 related to an office space that will no longer be utilized.\n\n\n\nCash flows from financing activities\nReviewing the Carrying Values of Goodwill - The Company adheres to the guidance under ASC 350-20 in testing goodwill for impairment. Under this guidance, the Company has the option of performing a qualitative assessment for impairment prior to performing the quantitative tests. A quantitative analysis was performed in 2019 and 2018 and a qualitative analysis was performed in 2017. The Company performs impairment testing of goodwill on an annual basis or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired. We perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter when our five-year plan is updated.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company entered into a new Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") and terminated the then-existing Corporate Credit Agreement. The Credit Agreement has financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of December 31, 2019, these ratios and limitations include a maximum consolidated secured total leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 and a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of 1.50 to 1.00. See Note 8 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for further details regarding our outstanding debt and other financing arrangements, including certain information about maturities, covenants and restrictions related to such debt and financing arrangements. The agreements and instruments governing our debt and financing arrangements are complicated, and you should consult such agreements and instruments which are filed with the SEC for more detailed information.\nIT Services and Hardware costs increased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to increased payroll and contractor costs associated with resources utilized to support the revenue growth in the Communications and Consulting practices for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the same period in the prior year. In addition, Hawaiian Telcom contributed $21.9 million and $9.8 million to cost of services and products in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Costs increased in 2018 compared to the prior year comparable period primarily due to expense associated with headcount in place for twelve months in 2018 versus three months in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of OnX.\n \u2022 The proposed Merger may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. \nCorporate\nThe Company's Senior Notes are governed by indentures which contain covenants that, among other things, limit the Company's ability to incur additional debt or liens, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, sell, transfer, lease, or dispose of assets and make investments or merge with another company. The Company is in compliance with all of its debt indentures as of December 31, 2019.\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nSG&A increased $2.2 million and $53.5 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively, as compared to the same periods in the prior year. The increase in 2019 is primarily driven by the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom, which contributed $9.4 million in 2019 compared to $5.4 million in 2018. The acquisition of OnX contributed an increase of $51.3 million for 2018 as compared to the same period in 2017 in addition to the expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom. Increases in SG&A related to the acquisitions in both comparable years were partially offset by lower payroll related costs due to restructuring initiatives executed in 2018 and 2017.\nIT Services and Hardware\nIn October 2011, the FCC adopted new rules aimed at controlling the size of the high-cost portion of the fund and transitioning it from supporting legacy circuit-switched networks to broadband. These rules capped the high-cost fund and established a framework for transitioning support to the new Connect America Fund (\"CAF\") to bring broadband to unserved areas. Phase I reforms froze existing high-cost support and provided a mechanism for distributing additional support for qualifying price cap companies. Hawaiian Telcom received $1.4 million in Phase I support and has completed its Phase I buildout. Under Phase II, $1.8 billion of annual support was made available to expand broadband in unserved areas served by price cap ILECs. In August 2015, price cap ILECs, which had the right of first refusal, accepted over $1.5 billion of the annual Phase II support that was available to them. Carriers accepting the Phase II support commitment have the funds available for a six-year period and must complete their commitment by the end of 2020. Cincinnati Bell Telephone ( CBT\u201d) accepted approximately $2 million in annual Phase II support beginning in 2015 in exchange for a commitment to expand broadband to 6,339 Kentucky locations and 745 Ohio locations. Hawaiian Telcom accepted $4.4 million to build to 11,081 locations in Hawaii over the six-year award period.\nWe are subject to various lawsuits, actions, proceedings, claims and other matters asserted under laws and regulations in the normal course of business. We believe that the amounts provided in our consolidated financial statements, as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles, are adequate in light of the those contingencies that are probable and able to be estimated. However, there can be no assurances that the actual amounts required to satisfy alleged liabilities from various legal proceedings, claims, tax examinations, and other matters, including the matters discussed below, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, will not exceed the amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As such, costs, if any, that may be incurred in excess of those amounts provided as of December 31, 2019, cannot be reasonably determined.\n \u2022 accounting for income taxes; and \n (6) Includes the portion of liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits. If the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated for unrecognized tax benefits, these liabilities are included in the \"Thereafter\" column of the table above. \nIndentures\nFuture Operating Trends\n \u2022 One large customer accounts for a significant portion of the Company's accounts receivable. The loss or significant reduction in business from this customer would cause operating results to decline and could negatively impact profitability and cash flows; \nInterest payments were $129.3 million, $131.7 million and $65.7 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Interest payments decreased in 2019 compared to the prior year primarily due to payments in 2018 which included $3.5 million of accrued interest related to Hawaiian Telcom. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 is due to additional debt incurred to fund the acquisitions completed in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Our contractual debt maturities in 2020, including finance lease obligations and other financing arrangements, are $22.7 million and associated contractual interest payments are expected to be approximately $130 million.\nUniversal Service\nIn March 2017, Congress adopted a resolution under the Congressional Review Act to invalidate the new broadband privacy and security rules approved by the FCC in November 2016. In December 2017, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling restoring the information service classification of broadband Internet access service that existed prior to 2015 and affirmed that broadband consumer protection authority resides with the Federal Trade Commission. An accompanying Report and Order requires that Internet service providers disclose information about their practices relative to blocking, throttling, paid prioritization, or affiliated prioritization. The impact of this decision is neutral for the Company.\n\nThe Merger Agreement contains representations and warranties and covenants of the parties customary for a transaction of this nature.\nConsumer/SMB Fiber revenue increased by $56.9 million in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to increased revenue contributed by Hawaiian Telcom of $44.9 million. Hawaiian Telcom adds 42,700 video subscribers, 68,200 internet subscribers and 30,000 voice subscribers to the existing base of subscribers. The increase is also a result of the 5% increase in the subscriber base for internet in Cincinnati as we focus our attention on growing the internet FTTP subscriber base. In addition, the Average Revenue Per User ( ARPU\u201d) increased 4% for both internet and video in Cincinnati as compared to the prior year partially offsetting the decline in video subscribers in Cincinnati. ARPU increases are related to price increases for internet and video as well as the change in the mix of subscribers for video.\nHealthcare cost trend\nManagement estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of valuation methods, including both income-based and market-based methods. The income-based approach utilizes a discounted cash flow model using projected cash flows derived from the five-year plan, adjusted to reflect market participants' assumptions. Expected future cash flows are discounted at the weighted average cost of capital applying a market participant approach. The market-based approach utilizes earnings multiples from comparable publicly-traded companies. No goodwill impairment losses were recognized in 2019, 2018 or 2017.\nCertain of our variable rate debt, including debt under the Revolving Credit Facility and the Receivables Facility, uses LIBOR as one of the benchmarks for establishing the rate of interest and may be hedged with LIBOR-based interest rate derivatives. LIBOR is the subject of recent regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to be replaced with a new benchmark in 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include an increase in the cost of our variable rate indebtedness.\n\nCorporate SG&A costs increased in 2019 driven largely by higher payroll related costs. In 2018, certain functions previously allocated to Corporate were better aligned with the segment these functions support and expenses allocated to those segments, resulting in lower costs in 2018 compared to 2017.\nCash used in financing activities was $39.6 million in 2019. In 2019, the Company made debt repayments of $21.5 million related to finance leases and the Tranche B Term Loan due 2024. Additionally, the Company made net debt repayments of $6.1 million related to the Revolving Credit and the Receivables Facilities.\n\nEntertainment and Communications, continued\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\nRevenue\n\nThe Company's strategy for future growth is to diversify the geographies in which it operates. As a part of executing this strategy, in February 2017, the Company completed the acquisition of SunTel, a regional provider of network security, data connectivity, and unified communications solutions based in Troy, Michigan, and in October 2017 completed the acquisition of OnX, with locations throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. The expectation is that these acquisitions will continue to provide future growth opportunities in the IT Services and Hardware segment by providing additional geographies to operate within, and an expanded customer base in which to sell our products and services. In addition, the acquisitions create synergies and opportunities for cost savings.\n (5) Includes payments for Cincinnati and Hawaii Pension and Postretirement Plans as well as other employee retirement agreements. Amounts for 2020 include approximately $8 million expected to be contributed for postretirement benefits. Although the Company expects to continue operating the plans past 2020, its contractual obligation related to postretirement obligations only extends through 2020. Amounts for 2020 through 2026 include approximately $24 million of estimated cash contributions to the qualified pension plans. Expected qualified pension plan contributions are based on current plan design, legislation and current actuarial assumptions. Any changes in plan design, legislation or actuarial assumptions may also affect the expected contribution amount. \nExecutive Summary\nCable Franchises - Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana - The states of Ohio and Indiana permit statewide video service authorization. The Company is now authorized by Ohio and Indiana to provide service in its self-described territory with only 10-day notification to the local government entity and other providers. The authorization can be amended to include additional territory upon notification to the state. A franchise agreement with each local franchising authority is required in Kentucky. The Company has agreements with fifty-three franchising authorities in Kentucky.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $21.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. The liability is representative of governmental authorities' interpretation of tax law differing from the Company's interpretation. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate is $21.7 million. It is reasonably possible that existing unrecognized tax benefits related to a federal sequestration of AMT credits could decrease by $2.1 million within the next 12 months. Accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is recognized in interest expense.\nIT Services and Hardware SG&A costs increased in 2019 compared to the prior year due to additional expense contributed by Hawaiian Telcom. Hawaiian Telcom contributed SG&A costs of $9.4 million and $5.4 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2019 was partially offset by lower payroll costs resulting from headcount reductions carried out in 2018. SG&A costs were up in 2018 compared to 2017 primarily due to expense associated with headcount in place for twelve months in 2018 versus three months in 2017 as a result of the acquisition of OnX.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity, and Capital Resources\nEnterprise Fiber products include metro-ethernet, dedicated internet access, wavelength, IRU contracts, and wireless backhaul to macro-towers and small cells. As enterprise customers migrate from legacy products and copper-based technology, our metro-ethernet product becomes the preferred method of transport due to its ability to support multiple applications on a single physical connection.\nEnterprise Fiber capital expenditures in Cincinnati are related to success-based fiber builds, including associated equipment, for enterprise and carrier projects to provide ethernet services. Other capital expenditures are related to IT projects, cable and equipment maintenance and capacity additions, real estate upgrades and maintenance, plus other minor capital purchases.\n\nPending Acquisition by Brookfield\n\n \u2022 Adverse changes in the value of assets or obligations associated with the Company's employee benefit plans could negatively impact shareowners' deficit and liquidity; \nIndemnifications\nCash provided by financing activities was $420.2 million in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company terminated its existing Corporate Credit Agreement and entered into a new Credit Agreement that provides for a seven-year $600 million Tranche B Term Loan due 2024 with proceeds totaling $593 million, net of discounts, and a $200 million Revolving Credit Facility. Also in the fourth quarter of 2017, CB Escrow Corp., an Ohio corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Cincinnati Bell Inc., closed the private offering of $350 million aggregate principal amount of 8% Senior Notes at par. The proceeds of the note issuance were deposited into an escrow account and subsequently utilized at the time of closing of the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Debt repayments totaling $403.0 million related to the repayment of the remaining $315.8 million outstanding principal amount of the Tranche B Term Loan due 2020, including the related accrued and unpaid interest, as well as $77.6 million paid for OnX outstanding debt at the time of acquisition. Debt issuance costs paid totaled $19.1 million for the year. In addition, the Company repaid $89.5 million on the Receivables Facility in 2017.\nHawaii - In Hawaii, the legislature and the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission ( HPUC\u201d) have taken steps over the last decade to reduce rate regulation of some of the services of the Company's Hawaiian Telcom subsidiaries.\n \u2022 There are material uncertainties and risks associated with the proposed Merger Agreement and Merger. \n \u2022 The Company generates a substantial portion of its revenue by serving a limited geographic area; \nHawaii - In Hawaii, cable franchises must be approved by the Hawaii Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs. Since 2011, the Company's Hawaiian Telcom Services Company, Inc. subsidiary has held a cable franchise authorizing it to provide video services throughout the island of Oahu.\nOff-Balance Sheet

Cincinnati Bell's financial results, liquidity, capital resources, and critical accounting policies and estimates. Key points:\n\n- Revenue increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to prior years primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Growth in fiber offerings partially offset declines in legacy revenue. \n\n- Operating costs increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to prior years primarily due to the acquisition of Hawaiian Telcom. Excluding acquisition impacts, costs decreased due to cost containment efforts.\n\n- Net loss increased in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily due to higher interest expense associated with debt to fund the Hawaiian Telcom acquisition. \n\n- Cash from operations increased in 2019 and 2018 compared to prior years primarily due to contributions from acquisitions. Cash used in investing decreased in 2019 after funding the Hawaiian Telcom acquisition in 2018.\n\n- The company manages liquidity risks through its revolving credit and receivables facilities. There are no significant debt maturities until 2024.\n\n- Critical accounting policies and estimates relate to goodwill impairment, pension and postretirement expenses, income taxes, and valuation allowances. Key judgments relate to discount rates, expected returns, and tax laws. \n\n- In 2019, the company entered an agreement to be acquired by Brookfield Infrastructure. The merger is expected to close by end of 2020."}
