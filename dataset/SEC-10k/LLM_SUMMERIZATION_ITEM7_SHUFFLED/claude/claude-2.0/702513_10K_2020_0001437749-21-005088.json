Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are comprised of average daily balances.\nThe disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in Part I captioned Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A captioned Risk Factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nNet income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $14.2 million or $0.83 per share diluted and $15.0 million or $0.83 per share-diluted, respectively.\nThe current year includes the financial impact caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We participated in the PPP, funding 606 PPP loans totaling $163.5 million and we granted 278 payment deferrals on loans totaling $127.3 million to help our borrowers. Due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, we recorded a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses. We also experienced an unprecedented increase in deposit balances as all PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and as a result of customer behavior which was focused on cash accumulation.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, most of our borrowers who received loan payment deferrals have resumed making payments. Deferrals outstanding remained on loans totaling $9.5 million at December 31, 2020 and our COVID-19 credit concerns have moderated.\nDuring 2020, nonrecurring costs totaled $1.1 million associated with the termination of a technology management services contract and an employment severance agreement. We also repurchased 1,409,499 shares of common stock.\nThe prior year includes benefits from our acquisition of Merchants National Bank of Sacramento and our name change of our subsidiary bank. During 2019, acquisition related costs totaled $2.2 million and costs related to the name change totaled $503 thousand.\nFinancial Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nPerformance\nTable 57: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Net income of $14.2 million was a decrease of $797 thousand (5%) from $15.0 million earned during the prior year.

Management strives to provide those returns while exercising prudent risk management practices and maintaining adequate levels of capital and reserves.\nWe are focused on expanding our presence through organic growth and the addition of new strategically important locations. We will pursue attractive opportunities to enter related lines of business and to acquire financial institutions with complementary lines of business when it is beneficial to do so. During 2020, our growth in average assets of $182.4 million or 13% was aided by the Small Business Administration's ( SBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d).\nOur long-term success rests on the shoulders of the leadership team and its ability to effectively enhance the performance of the Company. As a financial services company, we are in the business of taking and managing risks. Whether we are successful depends largely upon whether we take the right risks and are rewarded appropriately for those risks. Our governance structure enables us to effectively manage all major aspects of our business through an integrated process that includes financial, strategic, risk and leadership planning.\nOur risks include not only credit, market and liquidity risk, the traditional concerns for financial institutions, but also operational risks, (including risks related to systems, processes or external events) as well as legal, regulatory and reputation risks. Our management processes, structures, and policies help to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and provide clear lines of authority for decision-making and accountability. Results are important, but equally important is how we achieve those results. Our core values and commitment to high ethical standards are essential to maintaining public trust and confidence in our Company.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.\nOverview\nThe current year includes the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn. During the year, we made changes to our qualitative factors (Q-Factors) that resulted in recording a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses. We participated in the PPP, which contributed to a substantial increase in our loan and deposit balances, and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which contributed to a decrease in our net interest margin.\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nNet income was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For 2020, increases in net interest income, decreases in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes were offset by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and decreases in noninterest income.\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.83 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nWe declared cash dividends of $0.21 per share in 2020 and $0.19 per share in 2019. In determining the amount of dividend to be paid, we give consideration to capital preservation objectives, the Company's risk profile, expected asset growth, projected earnings, and the overall dividend pay-out ratio.\nReturn on Average Assets and Return on Average Equity\nThe following table presents the return on average assets and return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For each of the periods presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income incorporated in this document.\nTable 70: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2019\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.86 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.03 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Return on average equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.27 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.09 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest income is our largest source of operating income. During 2020, in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 150 to 175 basis points, which contributed to a significant decrease in our net interest margin. During 2020, we also experienced significant increases in deposit balances. All PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and customer behavior has emphasized savings during the economic slowdown. We purchased municipal bonds and moderate-term mortgage backed securities to deploy much of this increased liquidity.\nThe net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.60%, a decrease of 34 basis points as compared to 2019.\nMaintaining our net interest margin in the future will be challenging as current market pressures are anticipated to cause our yield on interest-earning assets to continue to decline.\nNet interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $55.5 million and $53.5 million, respectively.\nInterest and loan fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $60.1 million, an increase of $516 thousand or 1% compared to a year previous.\nTable 71: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> During 2020, we recognized $664 thousand in accelerated fee income on PPP loans forgiven or repaid.

We also held interest-bearing deposits in the amount of $87.1 million. Management has been challenged to invest the rapidly increasing liquidity generated by growth in deposits and loan repayments.\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities totaled $446.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $287.0 million at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we purchased securities with a par value of $288 million. During 2020, we sold securities with a par value of $54.2 million resulting in $482 thousand in net realized gains. During 2020, we also received $88.5 million in proceeds from principal payments, calls and maturities within the available-for-sale securities portfolio.\nAt December 31, 2020, our net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities were $10.6 million compared with $3.7 million net unrealized gains at December 31, 2019. The changes in net unrealized gains was due to changes in market interest rates.\nWe recorded gross loan balances of $1.140 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $1.033 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $107 million. The increase in gross loans occurred from loans originated from the PPP, which had a balance of $130.8 million at December 31, 2020. Loans, exclusive of PPP declined $24.0 million during the year.\nNonperforming loans, which include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due over 90 days, increased by $1.4 million to $7.0 million, or 0.62% of gross loans (0.70% of gross loans excluding PPP loans), as of December 31, 2020, compared to $5.6 million, or 0.54% of gross loans as of December 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming assets results primarily from two commercial loans totaling $1.4 million and a $640 thousand commercial real estate loan, all of which are well secured, that were placed on nonaccrual status during the year ending December 31, 2020.\nPast due loans as of December 31, 2020 increased $498 thousand to $5.4 million, compared to $4.9 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in past due loans was primarily due to two commercial loans totaling $1.4 million. We believe that risk grading for past due and nonperforming loans appropriately reflects the risk associated with those loans.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we granted loan payment deferrals to help our borrowers. Without these deferrals, past due loan totals would have been higher at December 31, 2020. A detailed discussion of the loan payment deferrals is provided later in this document under the heading Troubled Debt Restructuring Guidance\u201d.\nAs part of the SBA coronavirus debt relief efforts, the SBA made six months of principal and interest payments on all SBA 7(a) loans. Without these payments, past due loan totals would have been higher at December 31, 2020. A detailed discussion of program is provided later in this document under the heading SBA Loan Payments\u201d.\nThe ALLL at December 31, 2020 increased $4.7 million to $16.9 million compared to $12.2 million at December 31, 2019. We recorded a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. At December 31, 2020, relying on our ALLL methodology, which uses criteria such as credit grading, historical loss rates, and qualitative factors we believe the ALLL is adequate. There is, however, no assurance that future loan and lease losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses. A detailed discussion of the ALLL is provided later in this document under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d. Also, see Note 5 Loans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the ALLL and the loan portfolio.\nPremises and equipment totaled $15.0 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $907 thousand compared to $15.9 million at December 31, 2019. During the year, we invested $1.1 million in premises and equipment.\nOur OREO balance at December 31, 2020 was $8 thousand compared to $35 thousand at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we transferred into OREO one foreclosed property in the amount of $8 thousand and sold one property out of OREO with a balance of $35 thousand for a net loss of $23 thousand.\nBank-owned life insurance increased $505 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $24.2 million compared to $23.7 million at December 31, 2019. During 2020, no new policies were purchased, no policies surrendered and no death benefits were received.\nOur net deferred tax assets were $4.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the deferred tax effect of unrealized gains in the investment portfolio partially offset by the deferred tax effect of the provision for loan and lease losses.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net decreased $765 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $15.7 million compared to $16.5 million at December 31, 2019 due to amortization of core deposit intangibles. We concluded that goodwill was not impaired during 2020. A detailed discussion of our impairment analysis is presented below under the heading Goodwill and Other Intangibles\u201d.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nOther assets, which include the Bank's investment in qualified zone academy bonds, FHLB stock, right-of-use lease asset and low income housing tax credit partnerships totaled $28.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $28.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase included one new $1.0 million Low Income Housing Tax Credit ( LIHTC\u201d) partnership investment.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2020, increased $276 million or 22% to $1.543 billion compared to December 31, 2019.\nTable 91: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Total non-maturing deposits increased $291.7 million compared to December 31, 2019.

During 2020, we deployed significant excess cash into our investment portfolio. Investment purchases were comprised primarily of longer duration municipal bonds and lower coupon mortgage backed securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased securities with a par value of $288 million and weighted average yield of 1.82% (1.96% tax equivalent).

In recent years, our loan origination activity has expanded to include other portions of California and northern Nevada. We manage our credit risk through various diversifications (borrower industry, geography, collateral type) of our loan portfolio, the application of sound underwriting policies and procedures, and ongoing credit monitoring practices. Generally, our loans are secured by real estate or other assets located in California. Repayment is expected from the borrower's cash flows or cash flows from real estate investments.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table presents the composition of the loan

residential mortgage loans which are geographically disbursed throughout the United States and are made to legal United States residents who do not possess a social security number. The ITIN loan portfolio is serviced by a third party. The majority of the ITIN loans are variable rate loans and may have an increased default risk in a rising rate environment. As with all loans, worsening economic conditions in the United States could cause us to suffer higher default rates on our ITIN loans and reduce the value of the assets that we hold as collateral. If in the future, we become responsible for servicing these loans, we may realize additional monitoring, servicing and appraisal costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio which would adversely affect our noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2020, we have granted 63 COVID-19 related payment deferrals for ITIN loans with balances totaling $3.8 million. Payment deferrals are limited to no more than six months.\nSFC Loans\nBetween May of 2014 and December of 2018, we purchased unsecured retail installment home improvement loans that were originated by Service Finance Company, LLC ( SFC\u201d). The loans were made through a network of over 8,000 approved home improvement dealers throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Loans within the portfolio have a wide range of terms, interest rates and purchase discounts or premiums and at origination were made to borrowers with FICO scores of 750 or higher. Principal repayments on these loans totaled $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The loans are serviced by a third party. If in the future, we become responsible for servicing these loans, we may realize additional monitoring and servicing costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio which would adversely affect our noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2020, we have granted 8 COVID-19 related payment deferrals for SFC loans with balances totaling $127 thousand.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nPPP Loans\nWe have 487 PPP loans totaling $130.8 million at December 31, 2020. Loan fee income net of loan origination costs is earned over the 24-month life of the loans as a part of the loan yield. During the fourth quarter of 2020, 119 PPP loans totaling $32.7 million were repaid. When a PPP loan is repaid prior to maturity, all unamortized fees and costs associated with the loan are accelerated into income. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized $664 thousand in accelerated fee income. At December 31, 2020, net fees totaling $2.2 million remain to be earned in future quarters.

Loans secured by real estate or other assets primarily located in California are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrower or proceeds from the sale of collateral. As such, our dependence on real estate secured loans increases the risk of loss in our loan portfolio when a market experiences declining real estate values. Furthermore, declining real estate values would negatively impact holdings of OREO.\nWe manage asset quality and mitigate credit risk through the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices. Our Loan Committee is charged with monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. The provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan and lease portfolio. The amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of loan portfolio quality, general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral, and other trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the ALLL. Reviews of nonperforming, past due loans and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the ALLL, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on a quarterly basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers, the value of the applicable collateral, loan and lease loss experience, estimated loan and lease losses, growth in the loan portfolio, prevailing economic conditions and other factors.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. Generally, when we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the loan for potential impairment using discount cash flows, except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, we use the current fair value of collateral, less selling costs. The starting point for determining the fair value of collateral is through obtaining independent appraisals. Generally, these appraisals are updated every twelve months. We obtain appraisals from a pre-approved list of independent, third party, local appraisal firms. Approval and addition to the list is based on experience, reputation, character, consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market. At a minimum, it is ascertained that the appraiser is: (1) currently licensed in the state in which the property is located, (2) is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised, (3) is actively engaged in the appraisal work, (4) has knowledge of current real estate market conditions and financing trends, (5) is reputable, and (6) is not on Freddie Mac's nor our Exclusionary List of appraisers and brokers. In most cases, appraisals will be reviewed by another independent third party to ensure the quality of the appraisal and the expertise and independence of the appraiser. Upon receipt and review, the external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment.\nOur impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis, whether the officer preparing the report deems it current, and, if not, allows for internal valuation adjustments with justification. Typical justified adjustments might include discounts for continued market deterioration subsequent to appraisal date, adjustments for the release of collateral contemplated in the appraisal, or the value of other collateral or consideration not contemplated in the appraisal. An appraisal over one year old in most cases will be considered stale dated and an updated or new appraisal will be required. Any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by our Chief Credit Officer. Although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans, we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements, negotiated short sales, broker price opinions, or the sales price of the note. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. Impairment analyses are updated, reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis at or near the end of each reporting period. Based on these processes, we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional provision for loan and lease losses or charge-offs from the date they become known.\nLoans are classified as nonaccrual when collection of principal or interest is doubtful; generally these are loans that are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by 90 days or more, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, all loans that are impaired are considered for nonaccrual status. Loans placed on nonaccrual will typically remain in nonaccrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear certain.\nUpon acquisition of real estate collateral, typically through the foreclosure process, we promptly begin to market the property for sale. If we do not receive offers or indications of interest within a reasonable timeframe, we will review market conditions to assess the pricing level that would enable us to sell the property. At the time of foreclosure, OREO is recorded at fair value less costs to sell ( cost\u201d), which becomes the property's new basis. Unless a current appraisal is available, an appraisal will be ordered prior to a loan migrating to OREO. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the ALLL. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations and the property is carried at the lower of the cost or fair value less expected selling costs. We obtain updated appraisals on OREO property every six to twelve months. Valuation adjustments recorded in a period are primarily based on (1) updated appraisals received during the period, or (2) management's authorization to reduce the selling price of the property during the period.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes our nonperforming assets as of December 31 for each of the last five years.\nTable 109: <table> <tbody>

These reviews are performed on both our non-owner and owner occupied credits. These reviews are completed to verify leasing status, to ensure the accuracy of risk ratings, and to develop proactive action plans with borrowers on projects. Stress testing is performed to determine the effect of rising cap rates, interest rates, and vacancy rates on the portfolio. Based on our analysis, we believe we are effectively managing the risks in this portfolio. There can be no assurance that declines in economic conditions, such as potential increases in retail or office vacancy rates, will not exceed the projected assumptions utilized in stress testing resulting in additional nonperforming loans in the future.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our restructured loans that qualify as troubled debt

Examples of such concessions include a reduction in the loan rate, forgiveness of principal or accrued interest, extending the maturity date(s) significantly, or providing a lower interest rate than would be normally available for a transaction of similar risk. As a result of these concessions, troubled debt restructured loans are impaired as we will not collect all amounts due, either principal or interest, in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement. Impairment reserves on non-collateral dependent troubled debt restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows of the restructured loans, discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loans carrying value. These impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the ALLL.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $6.1 million in troubled debt restructurings compared to $6.5 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had 91 loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings, of which 89 loans were performing according to their restructured terms. Troubled debt restructurings represented 0.53% of gross loans (0.60% of gross loans excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2020, compared with 0.63% at December 31, 2019. One new loan for $640 thousand was classified as troubled debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpaired loans of $4.1 million and $4.8 million were classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. For a restructured loan to be on accrual status, the loan's collateral coverage must generally be greater than or equal to 100% of the loan balance, the loan payments must be current, and the borrower must demonstrate the ability to make payments from a verified source of cash flow. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no obligations to lend additional funds on any restructured loans.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nTroubled Debt Restructuring Guidance\nFinancial institution regulators and the CARES Act have changed the treatment of short-term loan modifications for borrowers impacted by COVID-19. The change provides that modifications made in response to COVID-19, to borrowers under certain circumstances, should not be considered a troubled debt restructuring.\nWe have responded to the needs of our borrowers in accordance with the CARES Act and regulatory guidance to grant short-term COVID-19 related loan modifications. These modified loans are not troubled debt restructurings and are not considered to be past due or non-performing. We have granted payment deferrals ranging from one to six months determined on a case-by-case basis considering the nature of the business and the impact of COVID-19. Some borrowers on a case by case basis have been granted multiple payment deferrals but the deferrals in total are limited to no more than six months.\nIn accordance with the CARES Act and interagency guidance, these loans are generally classified based on their past due status prior to their deferral period, so they are classified as performing loans that accrue interest. Accrued and unpaid interest during the deferral period will be collected on a regular repayment schedule at the end of the deferral period.\nSince March of 2020, we have granted 278 payment deferrals on loans totaling $127.3 million. As of December 31, 2020 previously deferred loans totaling $115.6 million have resumed making payments or have paid off. Three loans that were previously deferred totaling $2.1 million were past due at December 31, 2020 and have been moved to nonaccrual status. Two of those loans totaling $1.4 million were made to one commercial borrower and are guaranteed under the California Capital Access Program for Small Business. The third loan for $640 thousand is a commercial real estate loan that was changed to a troubled debt restructured loan in the second quarter of 2020.\nThe following tables present approved loan payment deferrals that are in effect at December 31, 2020. For the loans with payment deferrals at December 31, 2020, one borrower also received a PPP loan through our SBA department.\nTable 113: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Scheduled to Resume\nIn The Three Months Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> March 31, 2021\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Number\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Length of 1st deferral granted:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Length of 2nd deferral granted:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>714 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 3 months\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,053 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loans serviced by others (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,959 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,514 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 114: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1) Loans serviced by others are small residential mortgages and consumer home improvement loans which are deferred on a short-term basis up to a maximum of six months.

At December 31, 2020, our loan portfolio included $31.7 million of SBA 7(a) loans (generally 75% guaranteed). Borrowers resumed responsibility for making their payments on these 7(a) loans in October 2020.\nOn December 27, 2020, the SBA extended their debt relief program. All qualifying loans approved by the SBA prior the CARES Act will receive an additional three months of principal and interest payments starting in February 2021. After the three-month period, borrowers who are considered underserved will receive an additional five months of principal and interest payments. Newly approved loans from February 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021, will receive six months of principal and interest payments.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nWe monitor credit quality and the general economic environment to ensure that the ALLL is maintained at a level that is adequate to cover estimated credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Our review of ALLL adequacy utilizes both quantitative and qualitative factors. The quantitative analysis relies on historical loss rates which have been quite low in recent years and which, unfortunately, may not be indicative of potential losses related to a pandemic such as we are currently experiencing with COVID-19. In response to quantitative data deficiencies, we have placed much greater reliance on qualitative factors (Q-Factors).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our review of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) focused on our Q-Factors for:\nTable 117: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Changes in international, national, regional and local conditions\u201d and\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and other similar conditions\u201d.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nWe considered concentrations of credit in industries that are more likely to be significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19. We evaluated our C&I portfolio by NAICS code and our CRE portfolio for concentrations of tenants and businesses in higher risk industries or for loans with higher LTVs. We also completed analyses on individual borrowers who may be higher risk. After completing this work, we significantly increased our Q-Factors for changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and other similar conditions\u201d and changes in international, national, regional and local conditions\u201d.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, most of our borrowers who received COVID-19 loan payment deferrals have resumed making payments and our COVID-19 credit concerns have moderated; nonaccrual loans decreased due to the repayment of a $1.1 million commercial real estate loan and classified assets decreased due to repayment of $7.2 million from one commercial real estate borrower.\nOur ALLL methodology, adjusted for the revised Q-Factors discussed above and the improvements in loan quality metrics necessitated an ALLL of $16.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 38% compared to our ALLL of $12.2 million at December 31, 2019. A provision for loan and lease losses of $5.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no provision for loan and lease loss during the same period a year ago. Our ALLL as a percentage of gross loans was 1.48% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 1.18% as of December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans (on which we have no expectation of loss) our ALLL as a percentage of gross loans was 1.68% as of December 31, 2020.\nManagement believes the Company's ALLL is adequate at December 31, 2020. There is, however, no assurance that future loan and lease losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could possibly result in future charges to the provision for loan and lease losses.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes the ALLL roll forward for each of the five years ended December 31.

</table>\nThe unallocated portion of ALLL provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk grading-based component, or in the specific reserve component of the ALLL, and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models. As of December 31, 2020, the unallocated allowance amount represented 4% of the ALLL, compared to 3% at December 31, 2019. While the ALLL composition is an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge-offs may occur, actual amounts may differ.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments, which is included in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $800 thousand and $695 thousand at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The adequacy of the reserve for unfunded commitments is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based upon changes in the amount of commitments, loss experience, and economic conditions we recorded $105 thousand of provision expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. When necessary, provision adjustments are recorded in Other Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net totaled $15.7 million at December 31, 2020 and primarily consisted of goodwill and core deposit intangibles recorded as part of previous acquisitions. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and any such impairment is recognized in the period identified. A more frequent assessment of possible goodwill impairment is performed whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the Bank is less than the carrying amount of the Bank's equity. The triggering events to be considered include a deterioration in general economic conditions, decreased overall financial performance of the Company, and a sustained decrease in the Company's stock price.\nDuring 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the related impacts on the economy and financial markets, we determined that it was appropriate to assess goodwill for impairment at the end of each quarter. At March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we determined that goodwill was not impaired.\nThroughout the fourth quarter of 2020, our stock price traded above tangible book value and our earnings compared favorably to pre-pandemic periods and to our projections. Pandemic related credit concerns moderated during the fourth quarter, most loans with payment deferrals resumed making payments, there was limited deterioration in our credit quality indicators and anticipated loan losses have not materialized. We used a third party valuation specialist to assist management in performing a quantitative test to assess goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2020. The fair value of the Company was calculated using a weighted average of the results from two valuation approaches: an income approach and a market approach. The indicated fair value of the Bank was determined to be in excess of the carrying amount of the Bank's equity by approximately 3% and management concluded that goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2021.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nDeposits\nTotal deposits as of December 31, 2020 were $1.543 billion compared to $1.267 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $276 million or 22%. The following table presents deposit balances by major category as of December 31 for the last two years. The increase in non-maturing deposits was due to PPP loan program disbursements and changes in customer behavior, which is placing greater emphasis on savings. The decrease in certificates of deposit reflect our decision to reduce reliance on public deposits and depositor reaction to the low interest rate environment.\nTable 125: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td>

The Subordinated Debt initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% per annum through December 19, 2020. Thereafter, interest on the Subordinated Debt will be paid at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 526 basis points resetting quarterly.

The notes are due in 2025.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nSenior Debt\nIn December of 2015, we entered into a senior debt loan agreement to borrow $10.0 million. During the second quarter of 2019, we completed the early repayment and termination of this variable-rate debt agreement.\nJunior Subordinated Debentures\nBank of Commerce Holdings Trust II\nDuring July of 2005, we participated in a $10.0 million private placement of fixed rate trust-preferred securities (the \"Trust-Preferred Securities\") through a wholly owned Delaware trust affiliate, Bank of Commerce Holdings Trust II (the \"Trust II\"). Trust II simultaneously issued $310 thousand common securities to the Holding Company. Rates paid on the Trust-Preferred Securities have transitioned from fixed to floating and are now paid on a quarterly basis at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 158 basis points (1.80% at December 31, 2020). The Trust-Preferred Securities mature on September 15, 2035, and the covenants allow for redemption of the securities at our option during any quarter prior to maturity.\nThe proceeds from the sale of the Trust-Preferred Securities were used by Trust II to purchase from the Holding Company the aggregate principal amount of $10.3 million of the Holding Company's junior subordinate debentures (the \"Notes\"). The net proceeds to the Holding Company from the sale of the Notes to Trust II were partially distributed to the Bank. The proceeds from the Notes qualify as Tier 1 capital under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nSOURCES OF INCOME\nInterest Income\nWe derive our income primarily from net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we receive on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is impacted by many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, the Federal Reserve Board in particular. Aside from changes in market interest rates, the current net interest margin will be affected by the following:\nTable 129: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The majority of our loans are fixed rate loans or variable rate loans that are already at their floor rate. This has mitigated the impact of declining interest rates on loan yields during 2020. The yield on loans, exclusive of PPP loans, has declined 20 basis points from 4.95% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 4.75% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 130: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> We have 487 PPP loans totaling $130.8 million which bear an interest rate of 1.00%. The yield on PPP loans is highly dependent on fees earned typically over the 24-month duration of the loans. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the average yield for PPP loans was 2.95%, including $2.1 million, in fees. At December 31, 2020, $2.2 million in unamortized fee income remains to be earned over the remaining contractual term of the loans. If the PPP loans are forgiven and repaid before the end of the 24-month loan term, we accelerate recognition of the unamortized loan fee, which increases the average yield. During 2020, we recognized $664 thousand in accelerated fee income.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 131: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The impact of declining interest rates has been more immediate on our investment portfolio and our interest-bearing deposits in other banks. Much of our investment portfolio is collateralized by residential and commercial real estate mortgages. The rapid decline interest rates earlier in the year facilitated the refinance of many of these mortgages, which accelerated bond repayments and accelerated amortization of bond premiums, lowering yields. Additionally, the accelerated cash flows from the investment portfolio were reinvested at substantially lower yields. Yield on taxable securities declined from 2.70% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 2.31% for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 132: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> During 2020, in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve cut its interest rates by 150 to 175 basis points. Our average yield on interest bearing deposits in other banks decreased 178 basis points for the current year compared to the prior year. We have also experienced significant increased deposit balances due to PPP loan program disbursements and changes in customer behavior. We expect to invest this excess liquidity into loans or our investment portfolio, which should enhance our net interest margin and net interest income.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 133: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Cash flows from our loan and investment portfolio are being reinvested in the current market at significantly lower rates. Recent bond purchases have centered on longer duration investments such as longer maturity municipal bonds and lower coupon and moderate-term mortgage backed securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nNet interest income reflects both the amount of earning assets we hold and our net interest margin, which is the difference between the yields we receive on our earning assets and the interest rates we pay to fund those assets. As a result, changes in either our net interest margin or the amount of earning assets we hold will affect our net interest income and earnings.\nIncreases or decreases in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin. Although our asset yields and funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, and cause our net interest margin to expand or contract. Many of our assets are tied to indexes, which adjust in response to changes in interest rates.\nWhen market interest rates begin to increase in the future, we anticipate that our interest rate risk position will be neutral to moderately liability sensitive which will remain true until sufficient rate rise allows variable rate loans to move higher off their floors.\nThe low interest rate environment combined with excess liquidity from increased deposits being invested in lower yielding assets has contributed to our lower net interest margin. Because many of our liabilities are already priced near historic lows with little room for further reductions, if interest rates decline, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of interest rate changes on our earnings under various simulated scenarios. The scenarios differ based on assumptions including the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes, and the slope of the yield curve.\nThere is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than simulated scenarios. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios, refinance our debt or take other strategic actions, which may result in losses or expenses.\nBANK OF COMMERCE

Most of these sources of income do not vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Possible exceptions include gains on sale of available-for-sale securities and death proceeds from bank-owned life insurance.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nLIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW\nMerchants Bank of Commerce\nWe have experienced a significant increase in deposit balances during 2020 as all PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and as a result of modified customer behavior which during the year was focused on cash accumulation. Through December 31, 2020, we have not experienced any unusual pressure on our deposit balances or on our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should this change, in addition to our primary sources of liquidity, the Bank has credit arrangements as discussed below.\nThe principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain our ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who wish either to withdraw funds on deposit or to draw upon their credit facilities. We monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position.\nIn addition to liquidity provided by core deposits, loan repayments and cash flows from securities, the Bank can borrow on a secured basis from the FHLB, borrow on a secured basis from the Federal Reserve Bank, borrow on established conditional federal funds lines of credit, sell securities, or issue subscription / brokered certificates of deposit.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Bank had the following credit arrangements:\nTable 136: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Line of credit with the FHLB of $370.2 million is subject to collateral requirements, namely the amount of pledged loans and investment securities.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 137: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>Line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of $6.5 million is subject to collateral requirements, namely the amount of pledged loans. </td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nTable 138: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td>Nonbinding unsecured federal funds line of credit agreements with three financial institutions.

At December 31, 2020, the Holding Company had cash balances of $3.9 million. Our principal source of cash is dividends received from the Bank. During 2020, the Bank paid dividends of $15.0 million to the Holding Company, most of which were used to repurchase common stock. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Holding Company in the future.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nNet cash of $22.8 million was provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020.

The objective of effective capital management is to produce competitive long-term returns for our shareholders while ensuring that adequate capital is maintained relative to the Company's risk profile. Our sources of capital include retained earnings, common and preferred stock issuance, and issuance of subordinated debt or trust notes.\nREGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES\nFederal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. The guidelines are risk-based,\u201d meaning that they are designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies. The current rules (commonly known as Basel III) require the Bank and the Company to meet a capital conservation buffer requirement in order to avoid constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers. The capital conservation buffer of 2.50% is added to the minimum capital ratios.\nThe Basel III minimum capital requirements plus the conservation buffer exceed the prior regulatory well-capitalized\u201d capital thresholds by 0.5 percentage points. This 0.5 percentage-point cushion allows institutions to dip into a portion of their capital conservation buffer before reaching a status that is considered less than well capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes.\nAs of January 1, 2020 for certain qualifying institutions, the FDIC accepts compliance with a Community Bank Leverage Ratio in lieu of the Basel III capital requirements. We are a qualifying institution; however, we have opted to continue reporting under the Basel III requirements. We can opt-in to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at any time in the future.\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nOverall capital adequacy is monitored on a day-to-day basis by management and reported to our Board of Directors on a monthly basis.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for Prompt Corrective Action ( FDIC PCA\u201d). There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank's risk category. The Holding Company and the Bank's capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2020, are presented in the following table.\nTable 145: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,

have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.\nTangible common shareholders' equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net. The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible book value is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by the number of shares outstanding. The tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value are considered a non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with the total shareholders' equity, total shareholders' equity ratio and book value per share.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nInformation regarding Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements is included in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document.\nCONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\nInformation regarding Concentration of Credit Risk is included in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated in this document.\nLENDING TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nThe business we conduct with directors, officers, significant shareholders and other related parties (collectively, Related Parties\u201d) is restricted and governed by various laws and regulations, including 12 CFR Part 215 (Regulation O). Furthermore, it is our policy to conduct business with Related Parties on an arm's length basis at current market prices with terms and conditions no more favorable than we provide in the normal course of business. See Note 23, Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for additional detail on lending transactions with related parties.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nInflation affects our financial position as well as operating results. It is our opinion that the effect of inflation on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 has not been material.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nOverview\nThrough our corporate governance structure, risk and return are evaluated to produce sustainable revenues, reduce risk of earnings volatility and increase shareholder value. The financial services industry is exposed to four major categories or types of risks; liquidity, credit, market and operational. Liquidity risk is the possibility that we will be unable to meet liability maturities and withdrawals, fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Credit risk is the potential inability of a customer to meet their repayment obligations or the inability of a bond issuer to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Market risk is the possibility asset and liability values will fluctuate in response to changes in market prices and yields, and operational risk is the potential for losses resulting from events involving people, processes, technology, legal issues, external events, regulation, or reputation.\nBoard Committees\nOur corporate governance structure begins with our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors evaluates risk through the Chief Risk Officer and our Enterprise Risk Management reporting and monitoring process (ERM). Our ERM is evaluated quarterly and compares our risk appetite and key risk indicators to actual results and to peer data. The Board of Directors also evaluates risk through a number of Board Committees including the following:\nTable 148: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Audit and Qualified Legal Compliance Committee reviews the scope and coverage of internal and external audit activities.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Loan Committee reviews credit risks in the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses ( ALLL\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Asset/Liability Management Committee ( ALCO\u201d) reviews liquidity risk, credit risk in the investment bond portfolio and market risk.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee evaluates corporate governance structure, committee performance and evaluates recommendations for the appointment of director nominees.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Technology Committee provides oversight with respect to technology and innovation and the related risk assessment and risk management process.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThese committees review reports from management, our auditors, and other outside sources. On the basis of materials that are available to them and on which they rely, the committees review the performance of our management and personnel, and establish policies, but neither the committees nor their individual members (in their capacities as members of the Board of Directors) is responsible for daily operations of the Company.\nManagement Committees\nTo ensure that our risk management goals and objectives are accomplished, oversight of our risk taking and risk management activities are conducted through a number of management committees comprised of members of management including the following:\nTable 149: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The Senior Management Committee establishes short and long-term strategies and operating plans. The committee establishes performance measures and reviews performance to plan on a monthly basis. The committee is also responsible for evaluating operational risk assessments and approving and implementing mitigating action plans.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The Asset Liability Roundtable establishes and monitors liquidity ranges, pricing, maturities, investment goals, and interest spread on balance sheet accounts.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The SOX 404 Compliance Committee has established the master plan for full documentation of our internal controls and compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> The Environmental, Social and Governance ( ESG\u201d) Committee. On February 16, 2021, we adopted an Environmental and Social Risk Policy Framework and created an ESG committee to strengthen our oversight of environmental and social governance issues. The ESG Committee reports to the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of the Board of Directors on ESG activities and practices, and also periodically updates the Board of Directors as to progress in achieving our ESG goals.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nRisk Management Controls\nWe use various controls and our ERM to manage risk exposure within the Company. Budgeting and variance analyses and key performance indicators provide an early indication of unfavorable results or heightened risk levels. Models are used to estimate market risk and net interest income sensitivity. Segmentation analysis is an important tool used to estimate expected and unexpected credit losses. Compliance with regulatory guidelines plays a significant role in risk management as well as corporate culture and the actions of management. Our code of ethics provides guidelines for all employees to use to ensure that they conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of service to our clients.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nLiquidity Risk Management\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk is the possibility that we will be unable to meet liability maturities, deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth or otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves maintaining ample and diverse funding capacity, liquid assets and other sources of cash to accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to business shocks or unanticipated events. ALCO is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy and the Bank's internal ALCO Roundtable group is responsible for planning and executing the funding activities and strategies.\nThe Bank's liquid assets consist of cash and amounts due from banks, cash from repayments and maturities of loans, short-term money market investments, sales of available-for-sale securities and cash flows from investments. Liquidity is generated from liabilities through deposit growth and term debt borrowings. Deposit marketing strategies are reviewed for consistency with liquidity policy objectives.\nThe Bank has secondary sources of liquidity available from correspondent banking lines of credit, a secured line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and a secured borrowing line with the FHLB. While these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of secondary liquidity in the future, their availability, as well as the possible use of other sources, is dependent on future economic and market conditions, pledging of acceptable collateral and maintenance of required minimum capital ratios.\nThe Holding Company's principal source of cash is dividends received from the Bank, which it has consistently received for many years. See Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 17 Regulatory Capital in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for a discussion of the restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends.\nTo accommodate future growth and business needs, we develop an annual capital expenditure budget during strategic planning sessions. Based on our budgets and forecasts, we believe that our earnings, acquisition of core deposits and wholesale borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to support liquidity needs in 2021.\nTerm Debt\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco borrowings\nWe periodically utilize FHLB advances as a source of wholesale funding to provide temporary liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $5.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. There were no FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2019. See Note 10 Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our FHLB borrowings.\nSubordinated Debt\nIn December of 2015, the Holding Company issued $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes due in 2025. The Subordinated Debt initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% per annum through December 19, 2020, payable semi-annually. Thereafter, interest on the Subordinated Debt will be paid at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 526 basis points, payable quarterly until the maturity date. In December of 2015, the Holding Company incurred subordinated debt issuance costs of $210 thousand, which were amortized over the initial five-year-term as additional interest expense.\nSenior Debt\nIn December of 2015, the Holding Company, entered into a senior debt loan agreement to borrow $10.0 million. During the second quarter of 2019, we completed the early repayment and termination of this debt agreement.\nTerm debt at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following:\nTable 150:

unable to meet their repayment obligations or that a bond issuer will be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Credit risk exists in our outstanding loans, letters of credit, FHLB affordable housing grant sponsorships, unfunded loan commitments, deposits with other institutions and investment bond portfolio. In all of these areas we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower/grantee/issuer, repayment sources and the nature of the underlying collateral given current events and conditions. We rely on various controls including our underwriting standards, loan policies, internal loan monitoring, ALLL methodology and credit reviews to manage credit risk.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nWe grant real estate construction, commercial, and installment loans to customers throughout northern California. In our judgment, a concentration exists in real estate related loans, which represented approximately 77% (86% of our gross loan portfolio excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2020 and 83% of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2019.\nCommercial real estate concentrations are managed to assure wide geographic and business diversity. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in our principal market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. Personal and business incomes, proceeds from the sale of real property, or proceeds from refinancing, represent the primary sources of repayment for a majority of these loans.\nWe recognize the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions. Accordingly, to prevent excessive exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent, we have established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent. In addition, we have an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nLoan portfolio\nCredit risk management for the loan portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of each individual borrower based on an analysis of the borrower's financial position in light of current industry, economic or geopolitical trends. As part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower, each credit is assigned a risk grade and is subject to approval based on our existing credit approval standards. Risk grading is a significant factor in determining the adequacy of the ALLL.\nCredit decisions are made by our Credit Administration subject to certain limitations and, when those limitations are encountered, the approvals are made by the Board Loan Committee. Credit risk is continuously monitored by Credit Administration for possible adjustment of a loan risk grade if there has been a change in the borrower's ability to perform under the terms of their obligation. Additionally, we may manage the size of our credit exposure through loan sales and loan participation agreements.\nOur specific underwriting standards and methods for each principal line of lending include industry-accepted analysis and modeling and certain proprietary techniques. Our underwriting criteria are designed to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines, including required loan-to-value ratios. Our credit administration policies contain mandatory lien position and debt service coverage requirements, and we generally require a guarantee from individuals owning 20% or more of the borrowing entity. Our evaluations of our borrowers' are facilitated by management's knowledge of local market conditions and periodic reviews by a consultant of our credit administration policies.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\nThe ALLL represents management's best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. Within the allowance, reserves are allocated to segments of the portfolio based on specific formula components. Changes to the ALLL are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item provision for loan and lease losses.\nWe perform periodic and systematic detailed evaluations of our lending portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess the overall collectability. We evaluate the following:\nTable 153: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> General conditions such as the portfolio composition, size and maturities of various segmented portions of the portfolio such as secured, unsecured, construction, and Small Business Administration.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Concentrations of borrowers, industries, geographical sectors, loan product, loan classes and collateral types.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Volume and trends in the aggregate of loan delinquencies, nonaccruals, and watch, criticized and classified loans\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nOur ALLL is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based upon independent methodologies. All components of the ALLL represent an estimation based on certain observable data that management believes most reflects the underlying credit losses being estimated. Changes in the amount of each component of the ALLL are directionally consistent with changes in the observable data, taking into account the interaction of the components over time.\nAn essential element of the methodology for determining the ALLL is our credit risk evaluation process, which includes credit risk grading of individual, commercial, construction, commercial real estate, and consumer loans. Loans are assigned credit risk grades based on our assessment of conditions that affect the borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement. That process includes reviewing borrower's current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each individual borrower. Loans are reviewed on an annual or rotational basis or as management becomes aware of information affecting the borrower's ability to fulfill its obligations. Each credit risk grade is assigned a loss percentage when calculating the adequacy of the ALLL.\nFor individually impaired loans, we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price or the fair value of collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. When developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan, we consider all available information reflecting past events and current conditions, including the effect of existing environmental factors. In addition to the ALLL, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined using estimates of the probability of funding and the associated inherent credit risk. This reserve is carried as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe make provisions to the ALLL as necessary through charges to operations that are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as provision for loan and lease loss expense. When a loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged against the allowance. Any recoveries of previously charged off loans and leases are credited back to the allowance. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular categories of the loan and lease portfolio.\nVarious regulatory agencies periodically review our ALLL as an integral part of their examination process. Such agencies may require us to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. There is uncertainty concerning future economic trends. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provisions for loan and lease losses in future periods. The ALLL should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will occur in the stated amounts or proportions.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Affordable Housing Grant and Access to Housing and Economic Assistance for Development Grant Sponsorships\nAs part of satisfying our CRA responsibilities, we are a sponsor for various nonprofit organizations which receive cash grants from the FHLB. Those grants require the nonprofit organization to comply with stipulated conditions of the grant over specified periods of time which typically vary from 10 to 15 years. If the nonprofit organization fails to comply, FHLB can require us to refund the amount of the grant to FHLB. To mitigate this contingent credit risk, Credit Administration underwrites the financial strength of the nonprofit organization and reviews their systems of internal control to determine, as best as is possible, that they will not fail to comply with the conditions of the grant.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nTo manage credit risk in the investment securities portfolio, we have an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer. We perform a pre-purchase analysis on all bonds not secured by the U.S. Government or Agency of the U.S. Government to ensure that the investment meets our credit risk requirements and repayment expectations. We perform annual and quarterly credit reviews to ensure our investments continue to meet our credit risk requirements and repayment expectations.\nDeposits With Other Institutions\nWe recognize the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions. Accordingly, to prevent excessive exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent, we have established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent.\nMarket Risk Management\nGeneral\nMarket risk is the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Market risk is inherent in our operating positions and activities including customers' loans, deposit accounts, securities and long-term debt. Loans and deposits generate income and expense, respectively, and the value of cash flows changes based on general economic levels, and most importantly, the level of interest rates.\nThe goal for managing our assets and liabilities is to optimize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the Company to undue interest rate risk. The absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability. Market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, and other relevant market rate or price risk. We do not operate a trading account, and do not hold a position with exposure to foreign currency exchange.\nWe face market risk through interest rate volatility. Net interest income, or margin risk, is measured based on rate shocks over varying time horizons versus a current stable interest rate environment. Assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used in the planning and budgeting model. The overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed on an ongoing basis with ALCO.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nThe investment securities portfolio is central to our asset liability management strategies. The decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon our assessment of current and projected economic and financial conditions, including the interest rate environment, liquidity, changes in a security's credit rating, the risk weighting of a security and other regulatory requirements. We classify our securities as available-for-sale\u201d or held-to-maturity\u201d at the time of purchase. We do not engage in trading activities. Securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. Securities available-for-sale may be sold to implement our asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates, and similar factors. Securities available-for-sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses, net of income taxes, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Gain or loss on sale of securities is calculated on the specific identification method.\nOperational Risk Management\nOperational risk is the potential for loss resulting from events involving people, processes, technology, legal or regulatory issues, external events, and reputation. In keeping with the corporate governance structure, the Senior Leadership committee is responsible for operational risk controls. Operational risks are managed through specific policies and procedures, controls and monitoring tools. Examples of these include reconciliation processes, transaction monitoring and analysis and system audits. Operational risks fall into two major categories, business specific and company-wide. The Senior Leadership committee works to ensure consistency in policies, processes and assessments. With respect to company-wide risks, the Senior Leadership committee works directly with members of our Board of Directors to develop policies and procedures for information security, business resumption plans, compliance and legal issues.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nSUMMARY OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document. Some of these significant accounting policies are considered critical and require management to make difficult, subjective or complex judgments or estimates. Management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the SEC's definition.\nValuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities\nAt the time of purchase, we designate a security as held-to-maturity or available-for-sale, based on our investment objectives, operational needs and intent to hold. We do not engage in trading activity. Securities designated as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. We have the ability and intent to hold these securities to maturity. Securities designated as available-for-sale may be sold to implement our asset/liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates, prepayment rates and similar factors. Securities designated as available-for-sale are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses, net of income taxes, are reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders' equity. Gains or losses on sale of securities are based on the specific identification method. The market value and credit rating of each security is monitored to identify changes in asset quality.\nSecurity values may be adjusted to reflect changes in valuation as a result of other-than-temporary declines in value. Investments with fair values that are less than amortized costs are considered impaired. Impairment may result from either a decline in the financial condition of the issuing entity or from changes in interest rates. At each financial statement date, management assesses each investment to determine if impaired investments are temporarily impaired or if the impairment is other-than-temporary based upon the positive and negative evidence available. Evidence evaluated includes, but is not limited to, industry analyst reports, credit market conditions, and interest rate trends.\nWhen an investment is other-than-temporarily impaired, we assess whether we intend to sell the security, or it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit losses. If we intend to sell the security or if it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire amount of other-than-temporary impairment is recognized in earnings.\nFor debt securities that are considered other-than-temporarily impaired and that we do not intend to sell and will not be required to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis, we separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is credit related (credit loss component) and the amount due to all other factors. The credit loss component is recognized in earnings and is calculated as the difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and the present value of its expected future cash flows.\nThe remaining differences between the investment's fair value and the present value of future expected cash flows is deemed to be due to factors that are not credit related and is recognized in other comprehensive income. Significant judgment is required in the determination of whether other-than-temporary impairment has occurred for an investment. We follow a consistent and systematic process for determining other-than-temporary impairment loss. We have designated the ALCO responsible for the other-than-temporary evaluation process.\nThe ALCO's assessment of whether an other-than-temporary impairment loss should be recognized incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information including, but not limited to: (1) the length of time and the extent of which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, (2) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (3) our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value, (4) whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments, and (5) general market conditions and industry or sector specific outlook. See Note 4 Securities in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for further detail on other-than-temporary impairment and the securities portfolio.\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nThe ALLL is based upon estimates of loan and lease losses and is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and reduced by net charge-offs. In periodic evaluations of the adequacy of the allowance balance, management considers our past loan and lease loss experience by type of credit, known and inherent risks in the portfolio, adverse situations that may affect a borrower's ability to repay, the estimated value of any underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other factors.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement reviews the ALLL on a monthly basis and conducts a formal assessment of the adequacy of the ALLL on a quarterly basis. These assessments include the periodic re-grading of classified loans based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency, seasoning, recent financial performance of the borrower, economic factors, changes in the interest rate environment and other factors as warranted. Loans are initially graded when originated. Loans are reviewed as they are renewed, when there is a new loan to the same borrower and/or when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of default. Confirmation of the quality of our grading process is obtained by independent reviews conducted by outside consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by periodic examination by various bank regulatory agencies. Management monitors delinquent loans continuously and identifies problem loans to be evaluated individually for impairment testing. For loans that are determined impaired, formal impairment measurement is performed at least quarterly on a loan-by-loan basis.\nOur method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans, an allowance factor for categories of credits and allowances for changing environmental factors (e.g., portfolio trends, concentration of credit, growth, economic factors). Allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits. Loss estimation factors for unimpaired loan categories are based on analysis of historical losses adjusted for changing environmental factors applicable to each loan category. Allowances for changing environmental factors are management's best estimate of the probable impact these changes would have on the loan portfolio as a whole. See Note 5 Loans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for further detail on the ALLL and the loan portfolio.\nValuation of Goodwill\nGoodwill results from a business combination, and is calculated as the amount of consideration paid in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired in a transaction. Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite life and is therefore not amortized. It is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if required by circumstances known as triggering events. The impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments. Events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include, among others, significant adverse change in the business climate, slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock.\nWe perform our analysis of goodwill at the reporting unit level analyzing factors that would impact the estimated fair value of the reporting unit compared to its carrying value. We first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired. If the qualitative assessment results indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative impairment test is performed. Various valuation methodologies are considered when completing the quantitative impairment test to determine the estimated fair value of the reporting unit which is then compared to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of the our Company (our only reporting unit) is less than its carrying amount, an impairment charge would be taken for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes reported in the consolidated financial statements are computed based on an asset and liability approach. We recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year, and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences that have been recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent it is more-likely-than-not that they will be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover the deferred tax assets, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations.\nIn projecting future taxable income, management develops assumptions including the amount of future state and federal pre-tax operating income, the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies. These assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates being used to manage the underlying business. We file consolidated federal and state income tax returns.\nASC 740-10-55 Income Taxes requires a two-step process that separates recognition from measurement of tax positions. We recognize the financial statement effect of a tax position when it is more-likely-than-not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. The measurement process is applied only after satisfying the recognition requirement and determines what amount of a tax position will be sustainable upon a potential examination or settlement. If upon measuring, the tax position produces a range of potential tax benefits, we may claim the highest tax benefit from that range as long as it is over 50% likely to be realized using a probability analysis.\nWe believe that all of the tax positions we have taken, meet the more likely than not recognition threshold. To the extent tax authorities disagree with these tax positions, our effective tax rates could be materially affected in the period of settlement with the taxing authorities. See Note 19 Income Taxes in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for further detail on our income taxes.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use fair value measurements to record fair value adjustments to certain assets and liabilities, and to determine fair value disclosures. We base our fair values on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Securities available-for-sale and derivatives are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Additionally, from time to time, we may be required to record certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, such as certain impaired loans held for investment, ( OREO\u201d), core deposit intangible and goodwill. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically involve write-downs of individual assets due to application of lower of cost or market accounting.\nWe have established and documented a process for determining fair value. We maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when developing fair value measurements. Whenever there is no readily available market data, we use our best estimate and assumptions in determining fair value, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. As a result, if other assumptions had been used, our recorded earnings or disclosures could have been materially different from those reflected in these consolidated financial statements. Additional information on our use of fair value measurements and our related valuation methodologies is provided in Note 18 Fair Values in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated in this document.", "item_7_truncated": "The following table presents the key components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOur risks include not only credit, market and liquidity risk, the traditional concerns for financial institutions, but also operational risks, (including risks related to systems, processes or external events) as well as legal, regulatory and reputation risks.

Generally, when we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the loan for potential impairment using discount cash flows, except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, we use the current fair value of collateral, less selling costs. The starting point for determining the fair value of collateral is through obtaining independent appraisals. Generally, these appraisals are updated every twelve months. We obtain appraisals from a pre-approved list of independent, third party, local appraisal firms. Approval and addition to the list is based on experience, reputation, character, consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market. At a minimum, it is ascertained that the appraiser is: (1) currently licensed in the state in which the property is located, (2) is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised, (3) is actively engaged in the appraisal work, (4) has knowledge of current real estate market conditions and financing trends, (5) is reputable, and (6) is not on Freddie Mac's nor our Exclusionary List of appraisers and brokers. In most cases, appraisals will be reviewed by another independent third party to ensure the quality of the appraisal and the expertise and independence of the appraiser. Upon receipt and review, the external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment.\n\nTable 110: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1) Nonperforming loans to gross loans (excluding PPP) is computed by dividing nonperforming loans by total gross loans excluding gross PPP loans.

December 31, 2020, the Bank had the following credit arrangements:\nOur impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis, whether the officer preparing the report deems it current, and, if not, allows for internal valuation adjustments with justification. Typical justified adjustments might include discounts for continued market deterioration subsequent to appraisal date, adjustments for the release of collateral contemplated in the appraisal, or the value of other collateral or consideration not contemplated in the appraisal. An appraisal over one year old in most cases will be considered stale dated and an updated or new appraisal will be required. Any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by our Chief Credit Officer. Although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans, we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements, negotiated short sales, broker price opinions, or the sales price of the note. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. Impairment analyses are updated, reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis at or near the end of each reporting period. Based on these processes, we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional provision for loan and lease losses or charge-offs from the date they become known.\nWe have responded to the needs of our borrowers in accordance with the CARES Act and regulatory guidance to grant short-term COVID-19 related loan modifications. These modified loans are not troubled debt restructurings and are not considered to be past due or non-performing. We have granted payment deferrals ranging from one to six months determined on a case-by-case basis considering the nature of the business and the impact of COVID-19. Some borrowers on a case by case basis have been granted multiple payment deferrals but the deferrals in total are limited to no more than six months.\nTable 98: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

lines of credit, a secured line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and a secured borrowing line with the FHLB. While these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of secondary liquidity in the future, their availability, as well as the possible use of other sources, is dependent on future economic and market conditions, pledging of acceptable collateral and maintenance of required minimum capital ratios.\nWe have an agreement with IntraFi Network ( IntraFi\u201d), formally known as Promontory Interfinancial Network LLC ( Promontory\u201d) which facilitates provision of FDIC deposit insurance to balances in excess of current FDIC deposit insurance limits. IntraFi's Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS\u201d) and Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) products use a deposit-matching program to exchange Bank deposits in excess of the current deposit insurance limits for excess balances at other participating banks, on a dollar-for-dollar basis (reciprocal arrangement). These products are designed to enhance our ability to attract and retain customers and increase deposits, by providing additional FDIC coverage to customers. CDARS and ICS deposits can also be arranged on a non-reciprocal basis.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nTable 85: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December

Loans are assigned credit risk grades based on our assessment of conditions that affect the borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement. That process includes reviewing borrower's current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each individual borrower. Loans are reviewed on an annual or rotational basis or as management becomes aware of information affecting the borrower's ability to fulfill its obligations. Each credit risk grade is assigned a loss percentage when calculating the adequacy of the ALLL.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nTable 58: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> o\n</td> <td> 1.5 million shares of common stock repurchased between October of 2019 and April of 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n</tbody> </table>\nThrough our corporate governance structure, risk and return are evaluated to produce sustainable revenues, reduce risk of earnings volatility and increase shareholder value. The financial services industry is exposed to four major categories or types of risks; liquidity, credit, market and operational. Liquidity risk is the possibility that we will be unable to meet liability maturities and withdrawals, fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Credit risk is the potential inability of a customer to meet their repayment obligations or the inability of a bond issuer to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Market risk is the possibility asset and liability values will fluctuate in response to changes in market prices and yields, and operational risk is the potential for losses resulting from events involving people, processes, technology, legal issues, external events, regulation, or reputation.\n\n\n\nTable 152: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2020\n</td>

If we do not receive offers or indications of interest within a reasonable timeframe, we will review market conditions to assess the pricing level that would enable us to sell the property. At the time of foreclosure, OREO is recorded at fair value less costs to sell ( cost\u201d), which becomes the property's new basis. Unless a current appraisal is available, an appraisal will be ordered prior to a loan migrating to OREO. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the ALLL. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations and the property is carried at the lower of the cost or fair value less expected selling costs. We obtain updated appraisals on OREO property every six to twelve months. Valuation adjustments recorded in a period are primarily based on (1) updated appraisals received during the period, or (2) management's authorization to reduce the selling price of the property during the period.\nTable 120: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> (1) ALLL to gross loans outstanding (excluding PPP) is computed by dividing the ALLL by total gross loans excluding gross PPP loans.

professional services, commercial real estate market and the residential real estate development industry sectors. Loans secured by real estate or other assets primarily located in California are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrower or proceeds from the sale of collateral. As such, our dependence on real estate secured loans increases the risk of loss in our loan portfolio when a market experiences declining real estate values. Furthermore, declining real estate values would negatively impact holdings of OREO.\nTable 67: <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> <td> o\n</td> <td> The Company's efficiency ratio of 64.5% for 2019 includes $2.7 million of non-recurring costs.

Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in our principal market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. Personal and business incomes, proceeds from the sale of real property, or proceeds from refinancing, represent the primary sources of repayment for a majority of these loans.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net decreased $765 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $15.7 million compared to $16.5 million at December 31, 2019 due to amortization of core deposit intangibles.

The Board of Directors evaluates risk through the Chief Risk Officer and our Enterprise Risk Management reporting and monitoring process (ERM). Our ERM is evaluated quarterly and compares our risk appetite and key risk indicators to actual results and to peer data. The Board of Directors also evaluates risk through a number of Board Committees including the following:\n\nWe recognize the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions. Accordingly, to prevent excessive exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent, we have established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent. In addition, we have an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer.\n\nDuring 2020, nonrecurring costs totaled $1.1 million associated with the termination of a technology management services contract and an employment severance agreement. We also repurchased 1,409,499 shares of common stock.\n\nManagement believes the Company's ALLL is adequate at December 31, 2020. There is, however, no assurance that future loan and lease losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could possibly result in future charges to the provision for loan and lease losses.\nAs part of the SBA coronavirus debt relief efforts, the SBA made six months of principal and interest payments on all SBA 7(a) loans that were in regular servicing status at March 27, 2020 and for new SBA 7(a) loans originated between March 27, 2020 and September 27, 2020. At December 31, 2020, our loan portfolio included $31.7 million of SBA 7(a) loans (generally 75% guaranteed). Borrowers resumed responsibility for making their payments on these 7(a) loans in October 2020.\n\nNet interest income is our largest source of operating income. During 2020, in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 150 to 175 basis points, which contributed to a significant decrease in our net interest margin. During 2020, we also experienced significant increases in deposit balances. All PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and customer behavior has emphasized savings during the economic slowdown. We purchased municipal bonds and moderate-term mortgage backed securities to deploy much of this increased liquidity.\n\n\nWe own a pool of Individual Tax Identification Number ( ITIN\u201d) residential mortgage loans which are geographically disbursed throughout the United States and are made to legal United States residents who do not possess a social security number. The ITIN loan portfolio is serviced by a third party. The majority of the ITIN loans are variable rate loans and may have an increased default risk in a rising rate environment. As with all loans, worsening economic conditions in the United States could cause us to suffer higher default rates on our ITIN loans and reduce the value of the assets that we hold as collateral. If in the future, we become responsible for servicing these loans, we may realize additional monitoring, servicing and appraisal costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio which would adversely affect our noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2020, we have granted 63 COVID-19 related payment deferrals for ITIN loans with balances totaling $3.8 million. Payment deferrals are limited to no more than six months.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth the contractual maturity of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020.\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net totaled $15.7 million at December 31, 2020 and primarily consisted of goodwill and core deposit intangibles recorded as part of previous acquisitions. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and any such impairment is recognized in the period identified. A more frequent assessment of possible goodwill impairment is performed whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the Bank is less than the carrying amount of the Bank's equity. The triggering events to be considered include a deterioration in general economic conditions, decreased overall financial performance of the Company, and a sustained decrease in the Company's stock price.\nThe composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management's objective of pursuing yield and a relatively stable source of interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity.\n\nOur provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes and reflects the application of federal and state statutory rates to our income before taxes. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 includes a $1.5 million decrease in our income tax provision composed of a $988 thousand reversal of our reserve for uncertain tax position and a $484 thousand benefit as a result of our cost segregation study and tangible property review.\n\nVision and Objectives\nIn December of 2015, we issued $10.0 million of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes. The Subordinated Debt initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% per annum through December 19, 2020. Thereafter, interest on the Subordinated Debt will be paid at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 526 basis points resetting quarterly. At December 31, 2020, the Subordinated Debt had a balance of $10.0 million net of unamortized debt issuance costs. The notes are due in 2025.\n\nWe have 487 PPP loans totaling $130.8 million at December 31, 2020. Loan fee income net of loan origination costs is earned over the 24-month life of the loans as a part of the loan yield. During the fourth quarter of 2020, 119 PPP loans totaling $32.7 million were repaid. When a PPP loan is repaid prior to maturity, all unamortized fees and costs associated with the loan are accelerated into income. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized $664 thousand in accelerated fee income. At December 31, 2020, net fees totaling $2.2 million remain to be earned in future quarters. The following tables provide additional information on PPP loans by industry and by loan size at December 31, 2020.\nWe monitor credit quality and the general economic environment to ensure that the ALLL is maintained at a level that is adequate to cover estimated credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Our review of ALLL adequacy utilizes both quantitative and qualitative factors. The quantitative analysis relies on historical loss rates which have been quite low in recent years and which, unfortunately, may not be indicative of potential losses related to a pandemic such as we are currently experiencing with COVID-19. In response to quantitative data deficiencies, we have placed much greater reliance on qualitative factors (Q-Factors).\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nOur ALLL is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based upon independent methodologies. All components of the ALLL represent an estimation based on certain observable data that management believes most reflects the underlying credit losses being estimated. Changes in the amount of each component of the ALLL are directionally consistent with changes in the observable data, taking into account the interaction of the components over time.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\nOn December 10, 2015, the Holding Company issued $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes to certain institutional investors. The Subordinated Notes qualify as Tier 2 Capital under the Final Rules. See Item 1A - Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further detail on potential risks relating to the Subordinated Notes.\nThe Basel III minimum capital requirements plus the conservation buffer exceed the prior regulatory well-capitalized\u201d capital thresholds by 0.5 percentage points. This 0.5 percentage-point cushion allows institutions to dip into a portion of their capital conservation buffer before reaching a status that is considered less than well capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in purchased loan pools and purchased participations at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The purchased loans presented in the table include the ITIN and SFC loans discussed under the heading Loans with Unique Credit Characteristics\u201d.\n\nDeposits\nNet cash of $260.8 million was used by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted principally of:\n\nWe have experienced a significant increase in deposit balances during 2020 as all PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and as a result of modified customer behavior which during the year was focused on cash accumulation. Through December 31, 2020, we have not experienced any unusual pressure on our deposit balances or on our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should this change, in addition to our primary sources of liquidity, the Bank has credit arrangements as discussed below.\n\nIncome Taxes\nWe periodically utilize FHLB advances as a source of wholesale funding to provide temporary liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $5.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. There were no FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2019. See Note 10 Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our FHLB borrowings.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 1.0 million shares of common stock over a period ending December 31, 2021. As of March 5, 2021, no shares have been repurchased under this program.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in net interest income due to changes in average balances (volume variance) and changes in average rates (rate variance) for 2020 compared to 2019 and 2019 compared to 2018. Changes in interest income and expense which are not specifically attributable to either volume or rate, are allocated proportionately between both variances. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a nominal basis; not on a tax equivalent basis.\nIn addition to liquidity provided by core deposits, loan repayments and cash flows from securities, the Bank can borrow on a secured basis from the FHLB, borrow on a secured basis from the Federal Reserve Bank, borrow on established conditional federal funds lines of credit, sell securities, or issue subscription / brokered certificates of deposit.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments, which is included in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $800 thousand and $695 thousand at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The adequacy of the reserve for unfunded commitments is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based upon changes in the amount of commitments, loss experience, and economic conditions we recorded $105 thousand of provision expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. When necessary, provision adjustments are recorded in Other Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, most of our borrowers who received loan payment deferrals have resumed making payments. Deferrals outstanding remained on loans totaling $9.5 million at December 31, 2020 and our COVID-19 credit concerns have moderated.\nThe ALLL represents management's best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. Within the allowance, reserves are allocated to segments of the portfolio based on specific formula components. Changes to the ALLL are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item provision for loan and lease losses.\n\nBoard Committees\nIn accordance with the CARES Act and interagency guidance, these loans are generally classified based on their past due status prior to their deferral period, so they are classified as performing loans that accrue interest. Accrued and unpaid interest during the deferral period will be collected on a regular repayment schedule at the end of the deferral period.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of certificates of deposit in amounts of $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2020.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nWhen market interest rates begin to increase in the future, we anticipate that our interest rate risk position will be neutral to moderately liability sensitive which will remain true until sufficient rate rise allows variable rate loans to move higher off their floors.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Borrowings\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\nThe following tables present approved loan payment deferrals that are in effect at December 31, 2020. For the loans with payment deferrals at December 31, 2020, one borrower also received a PPP loan through our SBA department.\nFinancial institution regulators and the CARES Act have changed the treatment of short-term loan modifications for borrowers impacted by COVID-19. The change provides that modifications made in response to COVID-19, to borrowers under certain circumstances, should not be considered a troubled debt restructuring.\nNet cash of $264.4 million was provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 principally consisted of:\nCredit decisions are made by our Credit Administration subject to certain limitations and, when those limitations are encountered, the approvals are made by the Board Loan Committee. Credit risk is continuously monitored by Credit Administration for possible adjustment of a loan risk grade if there has been a change in the borrower's ability to perform under the terms of their obligation. Additionally, we may manage the size of our credit exposure through loan sales and loan participation agreements.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility that we will be unable to meet liability maturities, deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth or otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves maintaining ample and diverse funding capacity, liquid assets and other sources of cash to accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to business shocks or unanticipated events. ALCO is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy and the Bank's internal ALCO Roundtable group is responsible for planning and executing the funding activities and strategies.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\nAs part of the SBA coronavirus debt relief efforts, the SBA made six months of principal and interest payments on all SBA 7(a) loans. Without these payments, past due loan totals would have been higher at December 31, 2020. A detailed discussion of program is provided later in this document under the heading SBA Loan Payments\u201d.\nIn December of 2015, the Holding Company, entered into a senior debt loan agreement to borrow $10.0 million. During the second quarter of 2019, we completed the early repayment and termination of this debt agreement.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate to the actual effective rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nThroughout the fourth quarter of 2020, our stock price traded above tangible book value and our earnings compared favorably to pre-pandemic periods and to our projections. Pandemic related credit concerns moderated during the fourth quarter, most loans with payment deferrals resumed making payments, there was limited deterioration in our credit quality indicators and anticipated loan losses have not materialized. We used a third party valuation specialist to assist management in performing a quantitative test to assess goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2020. The fair value of the Company was calculated using a weighted average of the results from two valuation approaches: an income approach and a market approach. The indicated fair value of the Bank was determined to be in excess of the carrying amount of the Bank's equity by approximately 3% and management concluded that goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2021.\nAsset Quality\nThe business we conduct with directors, officers, significant shareholders and other related parties (collectively, Related Parties\u201d) is restricted and governed by various laws and regulations, including 12 CFR Part 215 (Regulation O). Furthermore, it is our policy to conduct business with Related Parties on an arm's length basis at current market prices with terms and conditions no more favorable than we provide in the normal course of business. See Note 23, Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for additional detail on lending transactions with related parties.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $35.0 million, a decrease of $2.3 million or 6% compared to 2019. Decreases in noninterest expense included the following items:\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nBetween May of 2014 and December of 2018, we purchased unsecured retail installment home improvement loans that were originated by Service Finance Company, LLC ( SFC\u201d). The loans were made through a network of over 8,000 approved home improvement dealers throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Loans within the portfolio have a wide range of terms, interest rates and purchase discounts or premiums and at origination were made to borrowers with FICO scores of 750 or higher. Principal repayments on these loans totaled $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The loans are serviced by a third party. If in the future, we become responsible for servicing these loans, we may realize additional monitoring and servicing costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio which would adversely affect our noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2020, we have granted 8 COVID-19 related payment deferrals for SFC loans with balances totaling $127 thousand.\nThe ALLL at December 31, 2020 increased $4.7 million to $16.9 million compared to $12.2 million at December 31, 2019. We recorded a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. At December 31, 2020, relying on our ALLL methodology, which uses criteria such as credit grading, historical loss rates, and qualitative factors we believe the ALLL is adequate. There is, however, no assurance that future loan and lease losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses. A detailed discussion of the ALLL is provided later in this document under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d. Also, see Note 5 Loans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the ALLL and the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents information regarding the amortized cost, and contractual maturity structure of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the ALLL roll forward for each of the five years ended December 31. This table also includes impaired loan information for each of the five years as of December 31.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents the weighted average contractual interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nMarket Risk Management\nCredit risk management for the loan portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of each individual borrower based on an analysis of the borrower's financial position in light of current industry, economic or geopolitical trends. As part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower, each credit is assigned a risk grade and is subject to approval based on our existing credit approval standards. Risk grading is a significant factor in determining the adequacy of the ALLL.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our review of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) focused on our Q-Factors for:\nSubordinated Debt\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nIn late 2019, we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase 1.0 million common shares which was later increased to 1.5 million common shares. Between October of 2019 and April of 2020, all 1.5 million shares were repurchased at a total cost of $13.6 million including commissions, or an average of $9.11 per share.\n\n\nCONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table sets forth our year-to-date average balances for borrowings and their respective average rates for the periods indicated.\n\nFor variable rate loans, the following table summarizes those that are at or above their floor rate, and those that do not possess a contractual floor rate.\nFor individually impaired loans, we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price or the fair value of collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. When developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan, we consider all available information reflecting past events and current conditions, including the effect of existing environmental factors. In addition to the ALLL, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined using estimates of the probability of funding and the associated inherent credit risk. This reserve is carried as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe declared cash dividends of $0.21 per share in 2020 and $0.19 per share in 2019. In determining the amount of dividend to be paid, we give consideration to capital preservation objectives, the Company's risk profile, expected asset growth, projected earnings, and the overall dividend pay-out ratio.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, we had term debt outstanding with a carrying value of $15.0 million compared to $10.0 million at December 31, 2019. Term debt consisted of the following:\nCredit risk is the possibility that a loan customer will be unable to meet their repayment obligations or that a bond issuer will be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Credit risk exists in our outstanding loans, letters of credit, FHLB affordable housing grant sponsorships, unfunded loan commitments, deposits with other institutions and investment bond portfolio. In all of these areas we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower/grantee/issuer, repayment sources and the nature of the underlying collateral given current events and conditions. We rely on various controls including our underwriting standards, loan policies, internal loan monitoring, ALLL methodology and credit reviews to manage credit risk.\n\nThe investment securities portfolio also:\nFederal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. The guidelines are risk-based,\u201d meaning that they are designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies. The current rules (commonly known as Basel III) require the Bank and the Company to meet a capital conservation buffer requirement in order to avoid constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers. The capital conservation buffer of 2.50% is added to the minimum capital ratios.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nHistorically, we have concentrated our loan origination activities primarily within the California counties of El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, and Shasta. In recent years, our loan origination activity has expanded to include other portions of California and northern Nevada. We manage our credit risk through various diversifications (borrower industry, geography, collateral type) of our loan portfolio, the application of sound underwriting policies and procedures, and ongoing credit monitoring practices. Generally, our loans are secured by real estate or other assets located in California. Repayment is expected from the borrower's cash flows or cash flows from real estate investments.\nLoan Concentrations\nWe regularly perform thorough reviews of the commercial real estate portfolio, including semi-annual stress testing. These reviews are performed on both our non-owner and owner occupied credits. These reviews are completed to verify leasing status, to ensure the accuracy of risk ratings, and to develop proactive action plans with borrowers on projects. Stress testing is performed to determine the effect of rising cap rates, interest rates, and vacancy rates on the portfolio. Based on our analysis, we believe we are effectively managing the risks in this portfolio. There can be no assurance that declines in economic conditions, such as potential increases in retail or office vacancy rates, will not exceed the projected assumptions utilized in stress testing resulting in additional nonperforming loans in the future.\n\nTo ensure that our risk management goals and objectives are accomplished, oversight of our risk taking and risk management activities are conducted through a number of management committees comprised of members of management including the following:\n\nDeposits With Other Institutions\nThe low interest rate environment combined with excess liquidity from increased deposits being invested in lower yielding assets has contributed to our lower net interest margin. Because many of our liabilities are already priced near historic lows with little room for further reductions, if interest rates decline, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of interest rate changes on our earnings under various simulated scenarios. The scenarios differ based on assumptions including the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes, and the slope of the yield curve.\nWe manage asset quality and mitigate credit risk through the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices. Our Loan Committee is charged with monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. The provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan and lease portfolio. The amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of loan portfolio quality, general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral, and other trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the ALLL. Reviews of nonperforming, past due loans and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the ALLL, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on a quarterly basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers, the value of the applicable collateral, loan and lease loss experience, estimated loan and lease losses, growth in the loan portfolio, prevailing economic conditions and other factors.\n\nThe following table summarizes our nonperforming assets as of December 31 for each of the last five years.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for those years should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, included in Part II Item 8 of this report. Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are comprised of average daily balances.\nThe unallocated portion of ALLL provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk grading-based component, or in the specific reserve component of the ALLL, and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models. As of December 31, 2020, the unallocated allowance amount represented 4% of the ALLL, compared to 3% at December 31, 2019. While the ALLL composition is an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge-offs may occur, actual amounts may differ.\n\n\nPPP Loans\n\nThese uses of cash were partially offset by:\nNet income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $14.2 million or $0.83 per share diluted and $15.0 million or $0.83 per share-diluted, respectively.\nThe following table presents average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest-earning assets, and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOther assets, which include the Bank's investment in qualified zone academy bonds, FHLB stock, right-of-use lease asset and low income housing tax credit partnerships totaled $28.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $28.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase included one new $1.0 million Low Income Housing Tax Credit ( LIHTC\u201d) partnership investment.\nThese committees review reports from management, our auditors, and other outside sources. On the basis of materials that are available to them and on which they rely, the committees review the performance of our management and personnel, and establish policies, but neither the committees nor their individual members (in their capacities as members of the Board of Directors) is responsible for daily operations of the Company.\nThe carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities totaled $446.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $287.0 million at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we deployed significant excess cash into our investment portfolio. Investment purchases were comprised primarily of longer duration municipal bonds and lower coupon mortgage backed securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased securities with a par value of $288 million and weighted average yield of 1.82% (1.96% tax equivalent). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold securities with a par value of $54.2 million and weighted average yield of 2.21% (2.32% tax equivalent).\nBank of Commerce Holdings\nTroubled Debt Restructuring Guidance\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn December of 2015, we issued $10.0 million of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes. The Subordinated Debt initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% per annum through December 19, 2020. Thereafter, interest on the Subordinated Debt will be paid at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 526 basis points resetting quarterly. At December 31, 2020, the Subordinated Debt had a balance of $10.0 million net of unamortized debt issuance costs. The notes are due in 2025.\nNet cash of $22.8 million was provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. As disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The primary difference between net income and cash provided by operating activities, was non-cash items including:\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco borrowings\nThe current year includes the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn. During the year, we made changes to our qualitative factors (Q-Factors) that resulted in recording a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses. We participated in the PPP, which contributed to a substantial increase in our loan and deposit balances, and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which contributed to a decrease in our net interest margin.\nNon Interest Income\nWe considered concentrations of credit in industries that are more likely to be significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19. We evaluated our C&I portfolio by NAICS code and our CRE portfolio for concentrations of tenants and businesses in higher risk industries or for loans with higher LTVs. We also completed analyses on individual borrowers who may be higher risk. After completing this work, we significantly increased our Q-Factors for changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and other similar conditions\u201d and changes in international, national, regional and local conditions\u201d.\nThe following table presents the maximum outstanding balance at any month end, average balance during the year and effective weighted average interest rate during the year on outstanding term debt for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nLoan Portfolio\nLENDING TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nJunior Subordinated Debentures\n\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the ALLL for each of the five years as of December 31.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition to loans we have originated or loans we acquired in conjunction with our acquisition of Merchants National Bank of Sacramento, the loan portfolio includes purchased loan pools and purchased participations. Purchased loan pools and participations are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.\nTerm Debt\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nPremises and equipment totaled $15.0 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $907 thousand compared to $15.9 million at December 31, 2019. During the year, we invested $1.1 million in premises and equipment.\nOur OREO balance at December 31, 2020 was $8 thousand compared to $35 thousand at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we transferred into OREO one foreclosed property in the amount of $8 thousand and sold one property out of OREO with a balance of $35 thousand for a net loss of $23 thousand.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, most of our borrowers who received COVID-19 loan payment deferrals have resumed making payments and our COVID-19 credit concerns have moderated; nonaccrual loans decreased due to the repayment of a $1.1 million commercial real estate loan and classified assets decreased due to repayment of $7.2 million from one commercial real estate borrower.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nWe recorded gross loan balances of $1.140 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $1.033 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $107 million. The increase in gross loans occurred from loans originated from the PPP, which had a balance of $130.8 million at December 31, 2020. Loans, exclusive of PPP declined $24.0 million during the year.\nOverall capital adequacy is monitored on a day-to-day basis by management and reported to our Board of Directors on a monthly basis.\n\nLoans are reported as troubled debt restructurings when we grant a concession(s) to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that we would not otherwise consider. Examples of such concessions include a reduction in the loan rate, forgiveness of principal or accrued interest, extending the maturity date(s) significantly, or providing a lower interest rate than would be normally available for a transaction of similar risk. As a result of these concessions, troubled debt restructured loans are impaired as we will not collect all amounts due, either principal or interest, in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement. Impairment reserves on non-collateral dependent troubled debt restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows of the restructured loans, discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loans carrying value. These impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the ALLL.\n\nWe are participating in the PPP administered through the SBA. The growth in our assets resulting from the PPP has impacted our Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio as we have not utilized the liquidity available to us from the PPPLF and its associated beneficial capital treatment. We have not utilized the PPPLF because we have sufficient organic liquidity from other sources.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe prior year includes benefits from our acquisition of Merchants National Bank of Sacramento and our name change of our subsidiary bank. During 2019, acquisition related costs totaled $2.2 million and costs related to the name change totaled $503 thousand.\nWe use various controls and our ERM to manage risk exposure within the Company. Budgeting and variance analyses and key performance indicators provide an early indication of unfavorable results or heightened risk levels. Models are used to estimate market risk and net interest income sensitivity. Segmentation analysis is an important tool used to estimate expected and unexpected credit losses. Compliance with regulatory guidelines plays a significant role in risk management as well as corporate culture and the actions of management. Our code of ethics provides guidelines for all employees to use to ensure that they conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of service to our clients.\nSFC Loans\nAs of December 31, 2020, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for Prompt Corrective Action ( FDIC PCA\u201d). There are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the Bank's risk category. The Holding Company and the Bank's capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2020, are presented in the following table.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe Bank's liquid assets consist of cash and amounts due from banks, cash from repayments and maturities of loans, short-term money market investments, sales of available-for-sale securities and cash flows from investments. Liquidity is generated from liabilities through deposit growth and term debt borrowings. Deposit marketing strategies are reviewed for consistency with liquidity policy objectives.\nSBA Loan Payments\n\nSince March of 2020, we have granted 278 payment deferrals on loans totaling $127.3 million. As of December 31, 2020 previously deferred loans totaling $115.6 million have resumed making payments or have paid off. Three loans that were previously deferred totaling $2.1 million were past due at December 31, 2020 and have been moved to nonaccrual status. Two of those loans totaling $1.4 million were made to one commercial borrower and are guaranteed under the California Capital Access Program for Small Business. The third loan for $640 thousand is a commercial real estate loan that was changed to a troubled debt restructured loan in the second quarter of 2020.\nBank-owned life insurance increased $505 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $24.2 million compared to $23.7 million at December 31, 2019. During 2020, no new policies were purchased, no policies surrendered and no death benefits were received.\nThe following table presents the return on average assets and return on average equity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. For each of the periods presented, the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income as shown in the Consolidated Statements of Income incorporated in this document.\nDeposit Maturity Schedule\nThe following table presents the available-for-sale investment securities portfolio at fair value as of December 31, for each of the last three years.\nCASH DIVIDENDS AND PAYOUT RATIOS PER COMMON SHARE", "item_7_text": "The following table presents the key components of noninterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOur risks include not only credit, market and liquidity risk, the traditional concerns for financial institutions, but also operational risks, (including risks related to systems, processes or external events) as well as legal, regulatory and reputation risks. Our management processes, structures, and policies help to ensure compliance with laws and regulations and provide clear lines of authority for decision-making and accountability. Results are important, but equally important is how we achieve those results. Our core values and commitment to high ethical standards are essential to maintaining public trust and confidence in our Company.\n\nOther liabilities which include the Bank's liability for Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan ( SERP\u201d), deferred director compensation, operating leases and funding obligations for investments in LIHTC partnerships increased $463 thousand to $18.2 million as of December 31, 2020 compared to $17.7 million at December 31, 2019.\n\nSenior Debt\nThe decreases were partially offset by $1.1 million increase in salaries and related benefit, which included:\nBorrowings\n\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income\nWe perform periodic and systematic detailed evaluations of our lending portfolio to identify and estimate the inherent risks and assess the overall collectability. We evaluate the following:\nWe also earn noninterest income. Sources of noninterest income include fees earned on deposit related services, ATM and point of sale fees, payroll and benefit processing fees, earnings on bank-owned life insurance, gains on sale of available-for-sale securities, and dividends on FHLB stock. Most of these sources of income do not vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Possible exceptions include gains on sale of available-for-sale securities and death proceeds from bank-owned life insurance.\n\n\nNet income was $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $15.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For 2020, increases in net interest income, decreases in noninterest expense and provision for income taxes were offset by an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses and decreases in noninterest income.\nThe disclosures set forth in this item are qualified by important factors detailed in Part I captioned Forward-Looking Statements and Item 1A captioned Risk Factors of this report and other cautionary statements set forth elsewhere in the report.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nGeneral\nIn December of 2015, the Holding Company issued $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes due in 2025. The Subordinated Debt initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% per annum through December 19, 2020, payable semi-annually. Thereafter, interest on the Subordinated Debt will be paid at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 526 basis points, payable quarterly until the maturity date. In December of 2015, the Holding Company incurred subordinated debt issuance costs of $210 thousand, which were amortized over the initial five-year-term as additional interest expense.\nInformation regarding Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements is included in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document.\n\nCAPITAL ADEQUACY\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nPast due loans as of December 31, 2020 increased $498 thousand to $5.4 million, compared to $4.9 million as of December 31, 2019. The increase in past due loans was primarily due to two commercial loans totaling $1.4 million. We believe that risk grading for past due and nonperforming loans appropriately reflects the risk associated with those loans.\nThe proceeds from the sale of the Trust-Preferred Securities were used by Trust II to purchase from the Holding Company the aggregate principal amount of $10.3 million of the Holding Company's junior subordinate debentures (the \"Notes\"). The net proceeds to the Holding Company from the sale of the Notes to Trust II were partially distributed to the Bank. The proceeds from the Notes qualify as Tier 1 capital under Federal Reserve Board guidelines.\nOur ALLL methodology, adjusted for the revised Q-Factors discussed above and the improvements in loan quality metrics necessitated an ALLL of $16.9 million at December 31, 2020, an increase of 38% compared to our ALLL of $12.2 million at December 31, 2019. A provision for loan and lease losses of $5.3 million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020. There was no provision for loan and lease loss during the same period a year ago. Our ALLL as a percentage of gross loans was 1.48% as of December 31, 2020 compared to 1.18% as of December 31, 2019. Excluding PPP loans (on which we have no expectation of loss) our ALLL as a percentage of gross loans was 1.68% as of December 31, 2020.\nWe seek to provide competitive, long-term returns to our shareholders while serving the financial needs of the communities in our northern California market. Management strives to provide those returns while exercising prudent risk management practices and maintaining adequate levels of capital and reserves.\n\n\nSOURCES OF INCOME\nWe derive our income primarily from net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income we receive on interest-earning assets and the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income is impacted by many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies, the Federal Reserve Board in particular. Aside from changes in market interest rates, the current net interest margin will be affected by the following:\nAvailable-for-sale investment securities totaled $446.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared with $287.0 million at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we purchased securities with a par value of $288 million. During 2020, we sold securities with a par value of $54.2 million resulting in $482 thousand in net realized gains. During 2020, we also received $88.5 million in proceeds from principal payments, calls and maturities within the available-for-sale securities portfolio.\nA loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, we determine it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract, including scheduled interest payments. Generally, when we identify a loan as impaired, we measure the loan for potential impairment using discount cash flows, except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral. In these cases, we use the current fair value of collateral, less selling costs. The starting point for determining the fair value of collateral is through obtaining independent appraisals. Generally, these appraisals are updated every twelve months. We obtain appraisals from a pre-approved list of independent, third party, local appraisal firms. Approval and addition to the list is based on experience, reputation, character, consistency and knowledge of the respective real estate market. At a minimum, it is ascertained that the appraiser is: (1) currently licensed in the state in which the property is located, (2) is experienced in the appraisal of properties similar to the property being appraised, (3) is actively engaged in the appraisal work, (4) has knowledge of current real estate market conditions and financing trends, (5) is reputable, and (6) is not on Freddie Mac's nor our Exclusionary List of appraisers and brokers. In most cases, appraisals will be reviewed by another independent third party to ensure the quality of the appraisal and the expertise and independence of the appraiser. Upon receipt and review, the external appraisal is utilized to measure a loan for potential impairment.\n\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $4.6 million, a decrease of $1.4 million or 23% compared to a year previous.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nSubordinated Debt\n\nVarious regulatory agencies periodically review our ALLL as an integral part of their examination process. Such agencies may require us to provide additions to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examination. There is uncertainty concerning future economic trends. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the effect future economic trends may have on the level of the provisions for loan and lease losses in future periods. The ALLL should not be interpreted as an indication that charge-offs in future periods will occur in the stated amounts or proportions.\n\nTotal deposits as of December 31, 2020 were $1.543 billion compared to $1.267 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $276 million or 22%. The following table presents deposit balances by major category as of December 31 for the last two years. The increase in non-maturing deposits was due to PPP loan program disbursements and changes in customer behavior, which is placing greater emphasis on savings. The decrease in certificates of deposit reflect our decision to reduce reliance on public deposits and depositor reaction to the low interest rate environment.\nCapital\nInterest Income\n\nOur long-term success rests on the shoulders of the leadership team and its ability to effectively enhance the performance of the Company. As a financial services company, we are in the business of taking and managing risks. Whether we are successful depends largely upon whether we take the right risks and are rewarded appropriately for those risks. Our governance structure enables us to effectively manage all major aspects of our business through an integrated process that includes financial, strategic, risk and leadership planning.\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our restructured loans that qualify as troubled debt restructurings for each of the last five years.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nReturn on Average Assets and Return on Average Equity\nOur net deferred tax assets were $4.0 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2019. The decrease was due to the deferred tax effect of unrealized gains in the investment portfolio partially offset by the deferred tax effect of the provision for loan and lease losses.\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table sets forth the distribution of average deposits and their respective average rates for the periods indicated.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Bank had the following credit arrangements:\nOur impairment analysis documents the date of the appraisal used in the analysis, whether the officer preparing the report deems it current, and, if not, allows for internal valuation adjustments with justification. Typical justified adjustments might include discounts for continued market deterioration subsequent to appraisal date, adjustments for the release of collateral contemplated in the appraisal, or the value of other collateral or consideration not contemplated in the appraisal. An appraisal over one year old in most cases will be considered stale dated and an updated or new appraisal will be required. Any adjustments from appraised value to net realizable value are detailed and justified in the impairment analysis, which is reviewed and approved by our Chief Credit Officer. Although an external appraisal is the primary source to value collateral dependent loans, we may also utilize values obtained through purchase and sale agreements, negotiated short sales, broker price opinions, or the sales price of the note. These alternative sources of value are used only if deemed to be more representative of value based on updated information regarding collateral resolution. Impairment analyses are updated, reviewed and approved on a quarterly basis at or near the end of each reporting period. Based on these processes, we do not believe there are significant time lapses for the recognition of additional provision for loan and lease losses or charge-offs from the date they become known.\nWe have responded to the needs of our borrowers in accordance with the CARES Act and regulatory guidance to grant short-term COVID-19 related loan modifications. These modified loans are not troubled debt restructurings and are not considered to be past due or non-performing. We have granted payment deferrals ranging from one to six months determined on a case-by-case basis considering the nature of the business and the impact of COVID-19. Some borrowers on a case by case basis have been granted multiple payment deferrals but the deferrals in total are limited to no more than six months.\nThe Bank has secondary sources of liquidity available from correspondent banking lines of credit, a secured line of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and a secured borrowing line with the FHLB. While these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of secondary liquidity in the future, their availability, as well as the possible use of other sources, is dependent on future economic and market conditions, pledging of acceptable collateral and maintenance of required minimum capital ratios.\nWe have an agreement with IntraFi Network ( IntraFi\u201d), formally known as Promontory Interfinancial Network LLC ( Promontory\u201d) which facilitates provision of FDIC deposit insurance to balances in excess of current FDIC deposit insurance limits. IntraFi's Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service ( CDARS\u201d) and Insured Cash Sweep ( ICS\u201d) products use a deposit-matching program to exchange Bank deposits in excess of the current deposit insurance limits for excess balances at other participating banks, on a dollar-for-dollar basis (reciprocal arrangement). These products are designed to enhance our ability to attract and retain customers and increase deposits, by providing additional FDIC coverage to customers. CDARS and ICS deposits can also be arranged on a non-reciprocal basis.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table summarizes as of December 31, 2020 when loans are projected to reprice by year and by rate index.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nInvestment Securities\nNonperforming loans, which include nonaccrual loans and accruing loans past due over 90 days, increased by $1.4 million to $7.0 million, or 0.62% of gross loans (0.70% of gross loans excluding PPP loans), as of December 31, 2020, compared to $5.6 million, or 0.54% of gross loans as of December 31, 2019. The increase in nonperforming assets results primarily from two commercial loans totaling $1.4 million and a $640 thousand commercial real estate loan, all of which are well secured, that were placed on nonaccrual status during the year ending December 31, 2020.\n\nThe Holding Company's principal source of cash is dividends received from the Bank, which it has consistently received for many years. See Item 1A Risk Factors and Note 17 Regulatory Capital in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for a discussion of the restrictions on the Bank's ability to pay dividends.\nNet interest income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $55.5 million and $53.5 million, respectively.\nBank of Commerce Holdings Trust II\nIn December of 2015, we entered into a senior debt loan agreement to borrow $10.0 million. During the second quarter of 2019, we completed the early repayment and termination of this variable-rate debt agreement.\nWe recognize the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions. Accordingly, to prevent excessive exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent, we have established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent.\nTo accommodate future growth and business needs, we develop an annual capital expenditure budget during strategic planning sessions. Based on our budgets and forecasts, we believe that our earnings, acquisition of core deposits and wholesale borrowing arrangements will be sufficient to support liquidity needs in 2021.\nIncreases or decreases in interest rates could adversely affect our net interest margin. Although our asset yields and funding costs tend to move in the same direction in response to changes in interest rates, one can rise or fall faster than the other, and cause our net interest margin to expand or contract. Many of our assets are tied to indexes, which adjust in response to changes in interest rates.\nThese sources were partially offset by:\nThe following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend pay-out ratios (dividends declared per common share divided by basic earnings per common share) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. These dividends were made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of, among other things, earnings, regulatory capital levels, our risk profile, capital preservation and expected growth. The dividend rate is reassessed periodically by the Board of Directors in accordance with the dividend policy. There is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased.\n\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nOn December 27, 2020, the SBA extended their debt relief program. All qualifying loans approved by the SBA prior the CARES Act will receive an additional three months of principal and interest payments starting in February 2021. After the three-month period, borrowers who are considered underserved will receive an additional five months of principal and interest payments. Newly approved loans from February 1, 2021 through September 30, 2021, will receive six months of principal and interest payments.\nThe following table presents the composition of the loan portfolio as of December 31 for each of the last five years.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Affordable Housing Grant and Access to Housing and Economic Assistance for Development Grant Sponsorships\nWe are focused on expanding our presence through organic growth and the addition of new strategically important locations. We will pursue attractive opportunities to enter related lines of business and to acquire financial institutions with complementary lines of business when it is beneficial to do so. During 2020, our growth in average assets of $182.4 million or 13% was aided by the Small Business Administration's ( SBA\u201d) Paycheck Protection Program ( PPP\u201d).\n\nCredit Risk Management\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nThe Holding Company is a separate entity from the Bank and must provide for its own liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the Holding Company had cash balances of $3.9 million. Our principal source of cash is dividends received from the Bank. During 2020, the Bank paid dividends of $15.0 million to the Holding Company, most of which were used to repurchase common stock. There are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to the Holding Company in the future.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CASH FLOW\nNet interest income reflects both the amount of earning assets we hold and our net interest margin, which is the difference between the yields we receive on our earning assets and the interest rates we pay to fund those assets. As a result, changes in either our net interest margin or the amount of earning assets we hold will affect our net interest income and earnings.\nAs part of satisfying our CRA responsibilities, we are a sponsor for various nonprofit organizations which receive cash grants from the FHLB. Those grants require the nonprofit organization to comply with stipulated conditions of the grant over specified periods of time which typically vary from 10 to 15 years. If the nonprofit organization fails to comply, FHLB can require us to refund the amount of the grant to FHLB. To mitigate this contingent credit risk, Credit Administration underwrites the financial strength of the nonprofit organization and reviews their systems of internal control to determine, as best as is possible, that they will not fail to comply with the conditions of the grant.\nNoninterest Expense\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nAt December 31, 2020, our net unrealized gains on available-for-sale securities were $10.6 million compared with $3.7 million net unrealized gains at December 31, 2019. The changes in net unrealized gains was due to changes in market interest rates.\n\n\nLiquidity Risk\nPerformance\nThe current year includes the financial impact caused by COVID-19 pandemic. We participated in the PPP, funding 606 PPP loans totaling $163.5 million and we granted 278 payment deferrals on loans totaling $127.3 million to help our borrowers. Due to the economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic, we recorded a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses. We also experienced an unprecedented increase in deposit balances as all PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and as a result of customer behavior which was focused on cash accumulation.\nDuring 2020, as a result of the pandemic and the related impacts on the economy and financial markets, we determined that it was appropriate to assess goodwill for impairment at the end of each quarter. At March 31, 2020, June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2020 through both qualitative and quantitative analysis, we determined that goodwill was not impaired.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\n\nAn essential element of the methodology for determining the ALLL is our credit risk evaluation process, which includes credit risk grading of individual, commercial, construction, commercial real estate, and consumer loans. Loans are assigned credit risk grades based on our assessment of conditions that affect the borrower's ability to meet its contractual obligations under the loan agreement. That process includes reviewing borrower's current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and other information specific to each individual borrower. Loans are reviewed on an annual or rotational basis or as management becomes aware of information affecting the borrower's ability to fulfill its obligations. Each credit risk grade is assigned a loss percentage when calculating the adequacy of the ALLL.\nRISK MANAGEMENT\nThrough our corporate governance structure, risk and return are evaluated to produce sustainable revenues, reduce risk of earnings volatility and increase shareholder value. The financial services industry is exposed to four major categories or types of risks; liquidity, credit, market and operational. Liquidity risk is the possibility that we will be unable to meet liability maturities and withdrawals, fund asset growth and otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Credit risk is the potential inability of a customer to meet their repayment obligations or the inability of a bond issuer to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Market risk is the possibility asset and liability values will fluctuate in response to changes in market prices and yields, and operational risk is the potential for losses resulting from events involving people, processes, technology, legal issues, external events, regulation, or reputation.\n\n\n\nMerchants Bank of Commerce\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had total consolidated assets of $1.764 billion, gross loans of $1.140 billion, allowance for loan and lease losses ( ALLL\u201d) of $16.9 million, total deposits of $1.543 billion, and shareholders' equity of $178 million.\nLoans are classified as nonaccrual when collection of principal or interest is doubtful; generally these are loans that are past due as to maturity or payment of principal or interest by 90 days or more, unless such loans are well-secured and in the process of collection. Additionally, all loans that are impaired are considered for nonaccrual status. Loans placed on nonaccrual will typically remain in nonaccrual status until all principal and interest payments are brought current and the prospects for future payments in accordance with the loan agreement appear certain.\n\nUpon acquisition of real estate collateral, typically through the foreclosure process, we promptly begin to market the property for sale. If we do not receive offers or indications of interest within a reasonable timeframe, we will review market conditions to assess the pricing level that would enable us to sell the property. At the time of foreclosure, OREO is recorded at fair value less costs to sell ( cost\u201d), which becomes the property's new basis. Unless a current appraisal is available, an appraisal will be ordered prior to a loan migrating to OREO. Any write-downs based on the asset's fair value at the date of acquisition are charged to the ALLL. After foreclosure, management periodically performs valuations and the property is carried at the lower of the cost or fair value less expected selling costs. We obtain updated appraisals on OREO property every six to twelve months. Valuation adjustments recorded in a period are primarily based on (1) updated appraisals received during the period, or (2) management's authorization to reduce the selling price of the property during the period.\nThere is always the risk that changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings in material amounts, especially if actual conditions turn out to be materially different than simulated scenarios. To reduce our interest rate risk, we may rebalance our investment and loan portfolios, refinance our debt or take other strategic actions, which may result in losses or expenses.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\n\nFinancial Highlights for the year ended December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nMaintaining our net interest margin in the future will be challenging as current market pressures are anticipated to cause our yield on interest-earning assets to continue to decline.\nDuring July of 2005, we participated in a $10.0 million private placement of fixed rate trust-preferred securities (the \"Trust-Preferred Securities\") through a wholly owned Delaware trust affiliate, Bank of Commerce Holdings Trust II (the \"Trust II\"). Trust II simultaneously issued $310 thousand common securities to the Holding Company. Rates paid on the Trust-Preferred Securities have transitioned from fixed to floating and are now paid on a quarterly basis at a rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 158 basis points (1.80% at December 31, 2020). The Trust-Preferred Securities mature on September 15, 2035, and the covenants allow for redemption of the securities at our option during any quarter prior to maturity.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of shareholders' equity (GAAP) to tangible common equity (non-GAAP), and total assets (GAAP) to tangible assets (non-GAAP) as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\n\nREGULATORY CAPITAL GUIDELINES\nImpaired loans of $4.1 million and $4.8 million were classified as accruing troubled debt restructurings at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. For a restructured loan to be on accrual status, the loan's collateral coverage must generally be greater than or equal to 100% of the loan balance, the loan payments must be current, and the borrower must demonstrate the ability to make payments from a verified source of cash flow. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no obligations to lend additional funds on any restructured loans.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nWe believe the tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value per share are meaningful measures that the Company and investors commonly use to assess the value and capital levels of the Company.\nGoodwill and Other Intangibles\nSenior Debt\n\nNet Interest Income and Net Interest Margin\nEquity capital is available to support organic and strategic growth, pay dividends and repurchase shares. The objective of effective capital management is to produce competitive long-term returns for our shareholders while ensuring that adequate capital is maintained relative to the Company's risk profile. Our sources of capital include retained earnings, common and preferred stock issuance, and issuance of subordinated debt or trust notes.\nLiquidity Risk Management\nInterest and loan fee income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $60.1 million, an increase of $516 thousand or 1% compared to a year previous.\n\n\nAt December 31, 2020, impaired loans had a corresponding specific allowance of $192 thousand. The specific allowance on impaired loans represents the impairment reserves on performing restructured loans, other accruing loans, and nonaccrual loans.\nThe following table presents our fixed and variable interest rate loans at December 31, 2020.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we granted loan payment deferrals to help our borrowers. Without these deferrals, past due loan totals would have been higher at December 31, 2020. A detailed discussion of the loan payment deferrals is provided later in this document under the heading Troubled Debt Restructuring Guidance\u201d.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nAs of January 1, 2020 for certain qualifying institutions, the FDIC accepts compliance with a Community Bank Leverage Ratio in lieu of the Basel III capital requirements. We are a qualifying institution; however, we have opted to continue reporting under the Basel III requirements. We can opt-in to use the Community Bank Leverage Ratio at any time in the future.\n\nOur uninsured deposits, which are the portion of deposit accounts that exceed the FDIC insurance limit (currently $250,000), approximated $795 million and $606 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts were estimated based on the same methodologies and assumptions used for regulatory reporting purposes.\nWhile every investment security has a contractual maturity, many have cash flows that differ from the contractual terms and result in earlier maturities. The following table presents the expected average life of investment securities at December 31, 2020.\nOur specific underwriting standards and methods for each principal line of lending include industry-accepted analysis and modeling and certain proprietary techniques. Our underwriting criteria are designed to comply with applicable regulatory guidelines, including required loan-to-value ratios. Our credit administration policies contain mandatory lien position and debt service coverage requirements, and we generally require a guarantee from individuals owning 20% or more of the borrowing entity. Our evaluations of our borrowers' are facilitated by management's knowledge of local market conditions and periodic reviews by a consultant of our credit administration policies.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nAs of December 31, 2020, we maintained noninterest-bearing cash positions at the Federal Reserve Bank and correspondent banks in the amount of $19.9 million. We also held interest-bearing deposits in the amount of $87.1 million. Management has been challenged to invest the rapidly increasing liquidity generated by growth in deposits and loan repayments.\n\nThe net interest margin for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 3.60%, a decrease of 34 basis points as compared to 2019.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nRisk Management Controls\n\nMarket risk is the potential loss due to adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Market risk is inherent in our operating positions and activities including customers' loans, deposit accounts, securities and long-term debt. Loans\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain our ability to meet the day-to-day cash flow requirements of our customers who wish either to withdraw funds on deposit or to draw upon their credit facilities. We monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $6.1 million in troubled debt restructurings compared to $6.5 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, we had 91 loans that were classified as troubled debt restructurings, of which 89 loans were performing according to their restructured terms. Troubled debt restructurings represented 0.53% of gross loans (0.60% of gross loans excluding PPP loans) as of December 31, 2020, compared with 0.63% at December 31, 2019. One new loan for $640 thousand was classified as troubled debt restructuring during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nITIN Loans\n\nWe make provisions to the ALLL as necessary through charges to operations that are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Income as provision for loan and lease loss expense. When a loan is deemed uncollectible, it is charged against the allowance. Any recoveries of previously charged off loans and leases are credited back to the allowance. There is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular categories of the loan and lease portfolio.\nAllowance for loan and lease losses\n\nCredit Quality\nTangible common shareholders' equity is calculated as total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, net. Tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, net. The tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by tangible assets. Tangible book value is calculated as tangible common shareholders' equity divided by the number of shares outstanding. The tangible common equity, tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value are considered a non-GAAP financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with the total shareholders' equity, total shareholders' equity ratio and book value per share.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nManagement Committees\nThe Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\n\n\nTerm Debt\nTerm debt at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following:\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nDiluted earnings per share were $0.83 for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nInflation affects our financial position as well as operating results. It is our opinion that the effect of inflation on our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 has not been material.\nOverview\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInformation regarding Concentration of Credit Risk is included in Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated in this document.\n\nLoans with unique credit characteristics\n\nOur loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in real estate and the ability for a significant portion of our borrowers to repay their loans is dependent upon the professional services, commercial real estate market and the residential real estate development industry sectors. Loans secured by real estate or other assets primarily located in California are expected to be repaid from cash flows of the borrower or proceeds from the sale of collateral. As such, our dependence on real estate secured loans increases the risk of loss in our loan portfolio when a market experiences declining real estate values. Furthermore, declining real estate values would negatively impact holdings of OREO.\n\nThe following table sets for the ratio of net charge-offs to average loans outstanding for the five years ended December 31.\nTo manage credit risk in the investment securities portfolio, we have an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer. We perform a pre-purchase analysis on all bonds not secured by the U.S. Government or Agency of the U.S. Government to ensure that the investment meets our credit risk requirements and repayment expectations. We perform annual and quarterly credit reviews to ensure our investments continue to meet our credit risk requirements and repayment expectations.\nWe grant real estate construction, commercial, and installment loans to customers throughout northern California. In our judgment, a concentration exists in real estate related loans, which represented approximately 77% (86% of our gross loan portfolio excluding PPP loans) at December 31, 2020 and 83% of our gross loan portfolio at December 31, 2019.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nConcentrations of credit risk\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net totaled $15.7 million at December 31, 2020 and primarily consisted of goodwill and core deposit intangibles recorded as part of previous acquisitions. See Note 7, Goodwill and Other Intangibles in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for additional detail goodwill and other intangible assets. When calculating capital ratios, goodwill and other intangible assets, net are deducted from Tier 1 capital.\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2020, increased $276 million or 22% to $1.543 billion compared to December 31, 2019.\nCommercial real estate concentrations are managed to assure wide geographic and business diversity. Although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability, a substantial decline in the economy in general, material increases in interest rates, changes in tax policies, tightening credit or refinancing markets, or a decline in real estate values in our principal market areas in particular, could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans. Personal and business incomes, proceeds from the sale of real property, or proceeds from refinancing, represent the primary sources of repayment for a majority of these loans.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net decreased $765 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $15.7 million compared to $16.5 million at December 31, 2019 due to amortization of core deposit intangibles. We concluded that goodwill was not impaired during 2020. A detailed discussion of our impairment analysis is presented below under the heading Goodwill and Other Intangibles\u201d.\n\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, the SBA began accepting applications for PPP loan forgiveness. The bank has 60 days to review and approve an application before submitting it to SBA, and the SBA then has 90 days to process it for forgiveness. The following table presents the status of our PPP loans as borrowers apply for forgiveness.\nThe following tables summarizes the allowance, reserve for unfunded commitments and discount on acquired loans for each of the five years ended December 31.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nPurchased Loans\n\nTANGIBLE BOOK VALUE PER SHARE AND TANGIBLE COMMON EQUITY RATIO\n\nOverview\nAverage Balances, Interest Income/Expense and Yields Earned/Rates Paid\nLoan portfolio\nOur corporate governance structure begins with our Board of Directors. The Board of Directors evaluates risk through the Chief Risk Officer and our Enterprise Risk Management reporting and monitoring process (ERM). Our ERM is evaluated quarterly and compares our risk appetite and key risk indicators to actual results and to peer data. The Board of Directors also evaluates risk through a number of Board Committees including the following:\n\nWe recognize the credit risks inherent in dealing with other depository institutions. Accordingly, to prevent excessive exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent, we have established general standards for selecting correspondent banks as well as internal limits for allowable exposure to other depository institutions in aggregate or to any single correspondent. In addition, we have an investment policy that sets forth limitations that apply to all investments with respect to credit rating and concentrations with an issuer.\n\nDuring 2020, nonrecurring costs totaled $1.1 million associated with the termination of a technology management services contract and an employment severance agreement. We also repurchased 1,409,499 shares of common stock.\n\nManagement believes the Company's ALLL is adequate at December 31, 2020. There is, however, no assurance that future loan and lease losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could possibly result in future charges to the provision for loan and lease losses.\nAs part of the SBA coronavirus debt relief efforts, the SBA made six months of principal and interest payments on all SBA 7(a) loans that were in regular servicing status at March 27, 2020 and for new SBA 7(a) loans originated between March 27, 2020 and September 27, 2020. At December 31, 2020, our loan portfolio included $31.7 million of SBA 7(a) loans (generally 75% guaranteed). Borrowers resumed responsibility for making their payments on these 7(a) loans in October 2020.\n\nNet interest income is our largest source of operating income. During 2020, in response to the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 150 to 175 basis points, which contributed to a significant decrease in our net interest margin. During 2020, we also experienced significant increases in deposit balances. All PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and customer behavior has emphasized savings during the economic slowdown. We purchased municipal bonds and moderate-term mortgage backed securities to deploy much of this increased liquidity.\n\n\nWe own a pool of Individual Tax Identification Number ( ITIN\u201d) residential mortgage loans which are geographically disbursed throughout the United States and are made to legal United States residents who do not possess a social security number. The ITIN loan portfolio is serviced by a third party. The majority of the ITIN loans are variable rate loans and may have an increased default risk in a rising rate environment. As with all loans, worsening economic conditions in the United States could cause us to suffer higher default rates on our ITIN loans and reduce the value of the assets that we hold as collateral. If in the future, we become responsible for servicing these loans, we may realize additional monitoring, servicing and appraisal costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio which would adversely affect our noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2020, we have granted 63 COVID-19 related payment deferrals for ITIN loans with balances totaling $3.8 million. Payment deferrals are limited to no more than six months.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table sets forth the contractual maturity of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2020.\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nGoodwill and other intangible assets, net totaled $15.7 million at December 31, 2020 and primarily consisted of goodwill and core deposit intangibles recorded as part of previous acquisitions. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment annually and any such impairment is recognized in the period identified. A more frequent assessment of possible goodwill impairment is performed whenever we identify certain triggering events or circumstances that would more likely than not indicate that the fair value of the Bank is less than the carrying amount of the Bank's equity. The triggering events to be considered include a deterioration in general economic conditions, decreased overall financial performance of the Company, and a sustained decrease in the Company's stock price.\nThe composition of our investment securities portfolio reflects management's objective of pursuing yield and a relatively stable source of interest income while maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity.\n\nOur provision for income taxes includes both federal and state income taxes and reflects the application of federal and state statutory rates to our income before taxes. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 includes a $1.5 million decrease in our income tax provision composed of a $988 thousand reversal of our reserve for uncertain tax position and a $484 thousand benefit as a result of our cost segregation study and tangible property review.\n\nVision and Objectives\nIn December of 2015, we issued $10.0 million of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes. The Subordinated Debt initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% per annum through December 19, 2020. Thereafter, interest on the Subordinated Debt will be paid at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 526 basis points resetting quarterly. At December 31, 2020, the Subordinated Debt had a balance of $10.0 million net of unamortized debt issuance costs. The notes are due in 2025.\n\nWe have 487 PPP loans totaling $130.8 million at December 31, 2020. Loan fee income net of loan origination costs is earned over the 24-month life of the loans as a part of the loan yield. During the fourth quarter of 2020, 119 PPP loans totaling $32.7 million were repaid. When a PPP loan is repaid prior to maturity, all unamortized fees and costs associated with the loan are accelerated into income. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized $664 thousand in accelerated fee income. At December 31, 2020, net fees totaling $2.2 million remain to be earned in future quarters. The following tables provide additional information on PPP loans by industry and by loan size at December 31, 2020.\nWe monitor credit quality and the general economic environment to ensure that the ALLL is maintained at a level that is adequate to cover estimated credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. Our review of ALLL adequacy utilizes both quantitative and qualitative factors. The quantitative analysis relies on historical loss rates which have been quite low in recent years and which, unfortunately, may not be indicative of potential losses related to a pandemic such as we are currently experiencing with COVID-19. In response to quantitative data deficiencies, we have placed much greater reliance on qualitative factors (Q-Factors).\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n\nOur ALLL is the accumulation of various components that are calculated based upon independent methodologies. All components of the ALLL represent an estimation based on certain observable data that management believes most reflects the underlying credit losses being estimated. Changes in the amount of each component of the ALLL are directionally consistent with changes in the observable data, taking into account the interaction of the components over time.\nNon-GAAP financial measures have inherent limitations, are not required to be uniformly applied, and are not audited. Although we believe these non-GAAP financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company, they have limitations as analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under GAAP.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n\nOn December 10, 2015, the Holding Company issued $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes to certain institutional investors. The Subordinated Notes qualify as Tier 2 Capital under the Final Rules. See Item 1A - Risk Factors, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 for further detail on potential risks relating to the Subordinated Notes.\nThe Basel III minimum capital requirements plus the conservation buffer exceed the prior regulatory well-capitalized\u201d capital thresholds by 0.5 percentage points. This 0.5 percentage-point cushion allows institutions to dip into a portion of their capital conservation buffer before reaching a status that is considered less than well capitalized for prompt corrective action purposes.\nNoninterest Income\nThe following table presents the recorded investment in purchased loan pools and purchased participations at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The purchased loans presented in the table include the ITIN and SFC loans discussed under the heading Loans with Unique Credit Characteristics\u201d.\n\nDeposits\nNet cash of $260.8 million was used by investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted principally of:\n\nWe have experienced a significant increase in deposit balances during 2020 as all PPP loan funds were deposited into customer accounts at our bank and as a result of modified customer behavior which during the year was focused on cash accumulation. Through December 31, 2020, we have not experienced any unusual pressure on our deposit balances or on our liquidity position as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Should this change, in addition to our primary sources of liquidity, the Bank has credit arrangements as discussed below.\n\nIncome Taxes\nWe periodically utilize FHLB advances as a source of wholesale funding to provide temporary liquidity. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $5.0 million in FHLB advances outstanding. There were no FHLB advances outstanding at December 31, 2019. See Note 10 Term Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information on our FHLB borrowings.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase up to 1.0 million shares of common stock over a period ending December 31, 2021. As of March 5, 2021, no shares have been repurchased under this program.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of the changes in net interest income due to changes in average balances (volume variance) and changes in average rates (rate variance) for 2020 compared to 2019 and 2019 compared to 2018. Changes in interest income and expense which are not specifically attributable to either volume or rate, are allocated proportionately between both variances. Interest income and yields on tax-exempt securities are presented on a nominal basis; not on a tax equivalent basis.\nIn addition to liquidity provided by core deposits, loan repayments and cash flows from securities, the Bank can borrow on a secured basis from the FHLB, borrow on a secured basis from the Federal Reserve Bank, borrow on established conditional federal funds lines of credit, sell securities, or issue subscription / brokered certificates of deposit.\nNonperforming Assets\nThe reserve for unfunded commitments, which is included in Other Liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, was $800 thousand and $695 thousand at December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The adequacy of the reserve for unfunded commitments is reviewed on a quarterly basis. Based upon changes in the amount of commitments, loss experience, and economic conditions we recorded $105 thousand of provision expense during the year ended December 31, 2020. When necessary, provision adjustments are recorded in Other Expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, most of our borrowers who received loan payment deferrals have resumed making payments. Deferrals outstanding remained on loans totaling $9.5 million at December 31, 2020 and our COVID-19 credit concerns have moderated.\nThe ALLL represents management's best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio. Within the allowance, reserves are allocated to segments of the portfolio based on specific formula components. Changes to the ALLL are reported in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the line item provision for loan and lease losses.\n\nBoard Committees\nIn accordance with the CARES Act and interagency guidance, these loans are generally classified based on their past due status prior to their deferral period, so they are classified as performing loans that accrue interest. Accrued and unpaid interest during the deferral period will be collected on a regular repayment schedule at the end of the deferral period.\nThe following table sets forth the maturities of certificates of deposit in amounts of $250,000 or more as of December 31, 2020.\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nWhen market interest rates begin to increase in the future, we anticipate that our interest rate risk position will be neutral to moderately liability sensitive which will remain true until sufficient rate rise allows variable rate loans to move higher off their floors.\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco Borrowings\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\nThe following tables present approved loan payment deferrals that are in effect at December 31, 2020. For the loans with payment deferrals at December 31, 2020, one borrower also received a PPP loan through our SBA department.\nFinancial institution regulators and the CARES Act have changed the treatment of short-term loan modifications for borrowers impacted by COVID-19. The change provides that modifications made in response to COVID-19, to borrowers under certain circumstances, should not be considered a troubled debt restructuring.\nNet cash of $264.4 million was provided by financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2020 principally consisted of:\nCredit decisions are made by our Credit Administration subject to certain limitations and, when those limitations are encountered, the approvals are made by the Board Loan Committee. Credit risk is continuously monitored by Credit Administration for possible adjustment of a loan risk grade if there has been a change in the borrower's ability to perform under the terms of their obligation. Additionally, we may manage the size of our credit exposure through loan sales and loan participation agreements.\nLiquidity risk is the possibility that we will be unable to meet liability maturities, deposit withdrawals, fund asset growth or otherwise meet contractual obligations at reasonable market rates. Liquidity management involves maintaining ample and diverse funding capacity, liquid assets and other sources of cash to accommodate fluctuations in asset and liability levels due to business shocks or unanticipated events. ALCO is responsible for establishing our liquidity policy and the Bank's internal ALCO Roundtable group is responsible for planning and executing the funding activities and strategies.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\nAs part of the SBA coronavirus debt relief efforts, the SBA made six months of principal and interest payments on all SBA 7(a) loans. Without these payments, past due loan totals would have been higher at December 31, 2020. A detailed discussion of program is provided later in this document under the heading SBA Loan Payments\u201d.\nIn December of 2015, the Holding Company, entered into a senior debt loan agreement to borrow $10.0 million. During the second quarter of 2019, we completed the early repayment and termination of this debt agreement.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate to the actual effective rate for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.\nThroughout the fourth quarter of 2020, our stock price traded above tangible book value and our earnings compared favorably to pre-pandemic periods and to our projections. Pandemic related credit concerns moderated during the fourth quarter, most loans with payment deferrals resumed making payments, there was limited deterioration in our credit quality indicators and anticipated loan losses have not materialized. We used a third party valuation specialist to assist management in performing a quantitative test to assess goodwill for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2020. The fair value of the Company was calculated using a weighted average of the results from two valuation approaches: an income approach and a market approach. The indicated fair value of the Bank was determined to be in excess of the carrying amount of the Bank's equity by approximately 3% and management concluded that goodwill was not impaired at December 31, 2021.\nAsset Quality\nThe business we conduct with directors, officers, significant shareholders and other related parties (collectively, Related Parties\u201d) is restricted and governed by various laws and regulations, including 12 CFR Part 215 (Regulation O). Furthermore, it is our policy to conduct business with Related Parties on an arm's length basis at current market prices with terms and conditions no more favorable than we provide in the normal course of business. See Note 23, Related Party Transactions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this document for additional detail on lending transactions with related parties.\nNoninterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $35.0 million, a decrease of $2.3 million or 6% compared to 2019. Decreases in noninterest expense included the following items:\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nBetween May of 2014 and December of 2018, we purchased unsecured retail installment home improvement loans that were originated by Service Finance Company, LLC ( SFC\u201d). The loans were made through a network of over 8,000 approved home improvement dealers throughout the United States and Puerto Rico. Loans within the portfolio have a wide range of terms, interest rates and purchase discounts or premiums and at origination were made to borrowers with FICO scores of 750 or higher. Principal repayments on these loans totaled $10.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The loans are serviced by a third party. If in the future, we become responsible for servicing these loans, we may realize additional monitoring and servicing costs due to the geographic disbursement of the portfolio which would adversely affect our noninterest expense. As of December 31, 2020, we have granted 8 COVID-19 related payment deferrals for SFC loans with balances totaling $127 thousand.\nThe ALLL at December 31, 2020 increased $4.7 million to $16.9 million compared to $12.2 million at December 31, 2019. We recorded a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the economic uncertainty caused by COVID-19. At December 31, 2020, relying on our ALLL methodology, which uses criteria such as credit grading, historical loss rates, and qualitative factors we believe the ALLL is adequate. There is, however, no assurance that future loan and lease losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the ALLL and could result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses. A detailed discussion of the ALLL is provided later in this document under the heading Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses\u201d. Also, see Note 5 Loans in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the ALLL and the loan portfolio.\nThe following table presents information regarding the amortized cost, and contractual maturity structure of the investment portfolio at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table summarizes the ALLL roll forward for each of the five years ended December 31. This table also includes impaired loan information for each of the five years as of December 31.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table presents the weighted average contractual interest rates on outstanding borrowings during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nMarket Risk Management\nCredit risk management for the loan portfolio begins with an assessment of the credit risk profile of each individual borrower based on an analysis of the borrower's financial position in light of current industry, economic or geopolitical trends. As part of the overall credit risk assessment of a borrower, each credit is assigned a risk grade and is subject to approval based on our existing credit approval standards. Risk grading is a significant factor in determining the adequacy of the ALLL.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, our review of the adequacy of our allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) focused on our Q-Factors for:\nSubordinated Debt\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nIn late 2019, we announced a share repurchase program to repurchase 1.0 million common shares which was later increased to 1.5 million common shares. Between October of 2019 and April of 2020, all 1.5 million shares were repurchased at a total cost of $13.6 million including commissions, or an average of $9.11 per share.\n\n\nCONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe following table sets forth our year-to-date average balances for borrowings and their respective average rates for the periods indicated.\n\nFor variable rate loans, the following table summarizes those that are at or above their floor rate, and those that do not possess a contractual floor rate.\nFor individually impaired loans, we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, except that as a practical expedient, a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan's observable market price or the fair value of collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent. When developing the estimate of future cash flows for a loan, we consider all available information reflecting past events and current conditions, including the effect of existing environmental factors. In addition to the ALLL, an allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit is determined using estimates of the probability of funding and the associated inherent credit risk. This reserve is carried as a liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe declared cash dividends of $0.21 per share in 2020 and $0.19 per share in 2019. In determining the amount of dividend to be paid, we give consideration to capital preservation objectives, the Company's risk profile, expected asset growth, projected earnings, and the overall dividend pay-out ratio.\n\nAt December 31, 2020, we had term debt outstanding with a carrying value of $15.0 million compared to $10.0 million at December 31, 2019. Term debt consisted of the following:\nCredit risk is the possibility that a loan customer will be unable to meet their repayment obligations or that a bond issuer will be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations. Credit risk exists in our outstanding loans, letters of credit, FHLB affordable housing grant sponsorships, unfunded loan commitments, deposits with other institutions and investment bond portfolio. In all of these areas we manage credit risk based on the risk profile of the borrower/grantee/issuer, repayment sources and the nature of the underlying collateral given current events and conditions. We rely on various controls including our underwriting standards, loan policies, internal loan monitoring, ALLL methodology and credit reviews to manage credit risk.\n\nThe investment securities portfolio also:\nFederal bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in the examination and regulation of bank holding companies and banks. The guidelines are risk-based,\u201d meaning that they are designed to make capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies. The current rules (commonly known as Basel III) require the Bank and the Company to meet a capital conservation buffer requirement in order to avoid constraints on capital distributions, such as dividends and equity repurchases, and certain bonus compensation for executive officers. The capital conservation buffer of 2.50% is added to the minimum capital ratios.\nThe following discussion and analysis provides a comparison of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nHistorically, we have concentrated our loan origination activities primarily within the California counties of El Dorado, Placer, Sacramento, and Shasta. In recent years, our loan origination activity has expanded to include other portions of California and northern Nevada. We manage our credit risk through various diversifications (borrower industry, geography, collateral type) of our loan portfolio, the application of sound underwriting policies and procedures, and ongoing credit monitoring practices. Generally, our loans are secured by real estate or other assets located in California. Repayment is expected from the borrower's cash flows or cash flows from real estate investments.\nLoan Concentrations\nWe regularly perform thorough reviews of the commercial real estate portfolio, including semi-annual stress testing. These reviews are performed on both our non-owner and owner occupied credits. These reviews are completed to verify leasing status, to ensure the accuracy of risk ratings, and to develop proactive action plans with borrowers on projects. Stress testing is performed to determine the effect of rising cap rates, interest rates, and vacancy rates on the portfolio. Based on our analysis, we believe we are effectively managing the risks in this portfolio. There can be no assurance that declines in economic conditions, such as potential increases in retail or office vacancy rates, will not exceed the projected assumptions utilized in stress testing resulting in additional nonperforming loans in the future.\n\nTo ensure that our risk management goals and objectives are accomplished, oversight of our risk taking and risk management activities are conducted through a number of management committees comprised of members of management including the following:\n\nDeposits With Other Institutions\nThe low interest rate environment combined with excess liquidity from increased deposits being invested in lower yielding assets has contributed to our lower net interest margin. Because many of our liabilities are already priced near historic lows with little room for further reductions, if interest rates decline, we could experience pressure on our net interest margin as our cost of funds increases relative to the yield we can earn on our assets. We assess our interest rate risk by estimating the effect of interest rate changes on our earnings under various simulated scenarios. The scenarios differ based on assumptions including the direction, magnitude and speed of interest rate changes, and the slope of the yield curve.\nWe manage asset quality and mitigate credit risk through the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan monitoring practices. Our Loan Committee is charged with monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. The provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the outstanding loan and lease portfolio. The amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors, including loan growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of loan portfolio quality, general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral, and other trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the ALLL. Reviews of nonperforming, past due loans and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the ALLL, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on a quarterly basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers, the value of the applicable collateral, loan and lease loss experience, estimated loan and lease losses, growth in the loan portfolio, prevailing economic conditions and other factors.\n\nThe following table summarizes our nonperforming assets as of December 31 for each of the last five years.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 and results of operations for those years should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, included in Part II Item 8 of this report. Average balances, including balances used in calculating certain financial ratios, are comprised of average daily balances.\nThe unallocated portion of ALLL provides for coverage of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio but not captured in the credit loss factors that are utilized in the risk grading-based component, or in the specific reserve component of the ALLL, and acknowledges the inherent imprecision of all loss prediction models. As of December 31, 2020, the unallocated allowance amount represented 4% of the ALLL, compared to 3% at December 31, 2019. While the ALLL composition is an indication of specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge-offs may occur, actual amounts may differ.\n\n\nPPP Loans\n\nThese uses of cash were partially offset by:\nNet income for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $14.2 million or $0.83 per share diluted and $15.0 million or $0.83 per share-diluted, respectively.\nThe following table presents average balance sheet information, together with interest income and yields earned on average interest-earning assets, and interest expense and rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nOther assets, which include the Bank's investment in qualified zone academy bonds, FHLB stock, right-of-use lease asset and low income housing tax credit partnerships totaled $28.2 million at December 31, 2020 compared to $28.6 million at December 31, 2019. The increase included one new $1.0 million Low Income Housing Tax Credit ( LIHTC\u201d) partnership investment.\nThese committees review reports from management, our auditors, and other outside sources. On the basis of materials that are available to them and on which they rely, the committees review the performance of our management and personnel, and establish policies, but neither the committees nor their individual members (in their capacities as members of the Board of Directors) is responsible for daily operations of the Company.\nThe carrying value of our available-for-sale investment securities totaled $446.9 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $287.0 million at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we deployed significant excess cash into our investment portfolio. Investment purchases were comprised primarily of longer duration municipal bonds and lower coupon mortgage backed securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased securities with a par value of $288 million and weighted average yield of 1.82% (1.96% tax equivalent). During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold securities with a par value of $54.2 million and weighted average yield of 2.21% (2.32% tax equivalent).\nBank of Commerce Holdings\nTroubled Debt Restructuring Guidance\n\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn December of 2015, we issued $10.0 million of fixed to floating rate Subordinated Notes. The Subordinated Debt initially bore interest at a fixed rate of 6.88% per annum through December 19, 2020. Thereafter, interest on the Subordinated Debt will be paid at a variable rate equal to three month LIBOR plus 526 basis points resetting quarterly. At December 31, 2020, the Subordinated Debt had a balance of $10.0 million net of unamortized debt issuance costs. The notes are due in 2025.\nNet cash of $22.8 million was provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. As disclosed in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows The primary difference between net income and cash provided by operating activities, was non-cash items including:\nFederal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco borrowings\nThe current year includes the financial impacts of COVID-19 and the resulting economic downturn. During the year, we made changes to our qualitative factors (Q-Factors) that resulted in recording a $5.3 million provision for loan lease and losses. We participated in the PPP, which contributed to a substantial increase in our loan and deposit balances, and the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, which contributed to a decrease in our net interest margin.\nNon Interest Income\nWe considered concentrations of credit in industries that are more likely to be significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19. We evaluated our C&I portfolio by NAICS code and our CRE portfolio for concentrations of tenants and businesses in higher risk industries or for loans with higher LTVs. We also completed analyses on individual borrowers who may be higher risk. After completing this work, we significantly increased our Q-Factors for changes in the volume and severity of past due loans and other similar conditions\u201d and changes in international, national, regional and local conditions\u201d.\nThe following table presents the maximum outstanding balance at any month end, average balance during the year and effective weighted average interest rate during the year on outstanding term debt for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nAllowance for Loan and Lease Losses\nLoan Portfolio\nLENDING TRANSACTIONS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nJunior Subordinated Debentures\n\nThe following table presents the key components of noninterest income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nThe following table sets forth the allocation of the ALLL for each of the five years as of December 31.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nIn addition to loans we have originated or loans we acquired in conjunction with our acquisition of Merchants National Bank of Sacramento, the loan portfolio includes purchased loan pools and purchased participations. Purchased loan pools and participations are recorded at their fair value at the acquisition date.\nTerm Debt\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nPremises and equipment totaled $15.0 million at December 31, 2020, a decrease of $907 thousand compared to $15.9 million at December 31, 2019. During the year, we invested $1.1 million in premises and equipment.\nOur OREO balance at December 31, 2020 was $8 thousand compared to $35 thousand at December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we transferred into OREO one foreclosed property in the amount of $8 thousand and sold one property out of OREO with a balance of $35 thousand for a net loss of $23 thousand.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, most of our borrowers who received COVID-19 loan payment deferrals have resumed making payments and our COVID-19 credit concerns have moderated; nonaccrual loans decreased due to the repayment of a $1.1 million commercial real estate loan and classified assets decreased due to repayment of $7.2 million from one commercial real estate borrower.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nWe recorded gross loan balances of $1.140 billion at December 31, 2020, compared with $1.033 billion at December 31, 2019, an increase of $107 million. The increase in gross loans occurred from loans originated from the PPP, which had a balance of $130.8 million at December 31, 2020. Loans, exclusive of PPP declined $24.0 million during the year.\nOverall capital adequacy is monitored on a day-to-day basis by management and reported to our Board of Directors on a monthly basis.\n\nLoans are reported as troubled debt restructurings when we grant a concession(s) to a borrower experiencing financial difficulties that we would not otherwise consider. Examples of such concessions include a reduction in the loan rate, forgiveness of principal or accrued interest, extending the maturity date(s) significantly, or providing a lower interest rate than would be normally available for a transaction of similar risk. As a result of these concessions, troubled debt restructured loans are impaired as we will not collect all amounts due, either principal or interest, in accordance with the terms of the original loan agreement. Impairment reserves on non-collateral dependent troubled debt restructured loans are measured by comparing the present value of expected future cash flows of the restructured loans, discounted at the effective interest rate of the original loan agreement to the loans carrying value. These impairment reserves are recognized as a specific component to be provided for in the ALLL.\n\nWe are participating in the PPP administered through the SBA. The growth in our assets resulting from the PPP has impacted our Tier 1 Leverage capital ratio as we have not utilized the liquidity available to us from the PPPLF and its associated beneficial capital treatment. We have not utilized the PPPLF because we have sufficient organic liquidity from other sources.\nBANK OF COMMERCE HOLDINGS & SUBSIDIARIES\nThe prior year includes benefits from our acquisition of Merchants National Bank of Sacramento and our name change of our subsidiary bank. During 2019, acquisition related costs totaled $2.2 million and costs related to the name change totaled $503 thousand.\nWe use various controls and our ERM to manage risk exposure within the Company. Budgeting and variance analyses and key performance indicators provide an early indication of unfavorable results or heightened risk levels. Models are used to estimate market risk and net interest income sensitivity. Segmentation analysis is an important tool used to estimate expected and unexpected credit losses. Compliance with regulatory guidelines plays a significant role in risk management as well as corporate culture and the actions of management. Our code of ethics provides guidelines for all employees to use to ensure that they conduct themselves with the highest integrity in the delivery of service to our clients.\nSFC Loans\nAs of December 31, 2020, the most recent notification from the FDIC categorized the Bank as well capitalized\u201d under the regulatory framework for Prompt Corrective Action ( FDIC PCA\u201d).

The Holding Company and the Bank's capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2020, are presented in the following table.\nReserve for Unfunded Commitments\nThe Bank's liquid assets consist of cash and amounts due from banks, cash from repayments and maturities of loans, short-term money market investments, sales of available-for-sale securities and cash flows from investments. Liquidity is generated from liabilities through deposit growth and term debt borrowings. Deposit marketing strategies are reviewed for consistency with liquidity policy objectives.\nSBA Loan Payments\n\nSince March of 2020, we have granted 278 payment deferrals on loans totaling $127.3 million.

Three loans that were previously deferred totaling $2.1 million were past due at December 31, 2020 and have been moved to nonaccrual status. Two of those loans totaling $1.4 million were made to one commercial borrower and are guaranteed under the California Capital Access Program for Small Business. The third loan for $640 thousand is a commercial real estate loan that was changed to a troubled debt restructured loan in the second quarter of 2020.\nBank-owned life insurance increased $505 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2020 to $24.2 million compared to $23.7 million at December 31, 2019.
