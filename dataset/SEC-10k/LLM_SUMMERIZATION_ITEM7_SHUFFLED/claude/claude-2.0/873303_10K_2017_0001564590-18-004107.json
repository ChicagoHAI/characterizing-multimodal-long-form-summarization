Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please review our legend titled Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this discussion, unless the context specifies or implies otherwise, the terms Sarepta\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic medicine approaches for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases.\nApplying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative RNA-targeted platform technologies, we are able to develop candidate therapies for a broad range of diseases and disorders.\nOur first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\nA summary description of our product and main product candidates is as follows:\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> EXONDYS 51, our first product, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. EXONDYS51 is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are in the process of conducting, starting or planning various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with regulatory NDA and/or MAA filing requirements as well as studies we need to conduct to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe clinical benefit.\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Golodirsen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. Golodirsen is designed to bind to exon 53 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or skipping\u201d, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 53 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGolodirsen, an exon 53-skipping product candidate, is currently in the clinic as part of a Phase 1/2 study. Part I has been completed and Part II, an open label portion of this study, is ongoing (Study 4053-101). In September 2017, we announced positive results of an analysis that included biopsies of the bicep muscle at baseline and on-treatment at the Part II, Week 48 time point. The study results demonstrated statistical significance on all primary and secondary biological endpoints.\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Casimersen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or skipping\u201d, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (Study 4045-301), our phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively.\nIn addition, pursuant to an ongoing Sarepta-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial studying casimersen (Study 4045-101), we have completed a dose titration portion (Phase 1) and are currently conducting the open-label portion of the study (Phase 2).\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> SRP-5051, one of our main product candidates, uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene.

Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we received clearance from the FDA and commenced a first in human, single ascending dose, study for our PPMO for the treatment of DMD in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping (SRP-5051). We expect to have data regarding safety and future dosing for SRP-5051 in the second half of 2018. In addition to SRP-5051, our 2018 plans currently include IND-enabling pre-clinical work on 5 additional PPMOs.\nIn addition to advancing our exon-skipping product candidates for DMD, we are working with several strategic partners under various agreements to research and develop multiple treatment approaches to DMD. These strategic partners include:\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Nationwide Children's Hospital, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of (1) their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a research and exclusive license option agreement and (2) their Galgt2 gene therapy program under an exclusive license agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Genethon, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Duke University, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 technology for muscular dystrophy under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement that grants us rights to certain of Duke University's intellectual property for CRISPR/Cas9; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Summit, with whom we are collaborating under an exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement that grants us exclusive rights to Summit's utrophin modulator pipeline, including ezutromid, in Europe, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States and an option to acquire rights in Latin America.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur RNA-targeted technologies work at the most fundamental level of biology and potentially could have a meaningful impact across a broad range of human diseases and disorders. Our lead program focuses on the development of disease-modifying therapeutic candidates for DMD, a rare genetic muscle-wasting disease caused by the absence of dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscle function. The basis of our novel RNA-targeted therapeutics is the PMO.\nPMO-based compounds are highly resistant to degradation by enzymes, potentially enabling robust and sustained biological activity. In contrast to other RNA-targeted therapeutics, which are usually designed to down-regulate protein expression, our technologies are designed to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate protein expression, and more importantly, create novel proteins. PMO-based compounds have demonstrated inhibition of mRNA translation and alteration of pre-mRNA splicing. PMO-based compounds have the potential to reduce off-target effects, such as the immune stimulation often observed with ribose-based RNA technologies. We believe that our highly differentiated, novel, proprietary and innovative RNA-targeted PMO-based platforms may represent a significant improvement over other RNA-targeted technologies. In addition, PMO-based compounds are highly adaptable molecules: with minor structural modifications, they can potentially be rapidly designed to target specific tissues, genetic sequences, or pathogens, and therefore, we believe they could potentially be applied to treat a broad spectrum of diseases.\nOur next generation PMO-based chemistries include PPMO, PMO-X\u00ae and PMOplus\u00ae. PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates is well tolerated and results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Preclinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMO, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle.\nWe have developed proprietary state-of-the-art manufacturing and techniques that allow synthesis and purification of our product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based products and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these techniques to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhances our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have own internal manufacturing capabilities to produce our product and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,089.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $599.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $479.4 million of short-term investments, $10.0 million of long-term investments and $0.8 million of long-term restricted cash and investments. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months.\nThe likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace, the risks associated with government sponsored programs and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nTable 234: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> revenue recognition;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Inventory;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> research and development expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> stock-based compensation; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> income tax.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer has been reasonably assured.\nProduct revenue, net\nWe are currently approved to sell EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. We distribute our product principally through a limited number of specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies (collectively, U.S. Customers\u201d). Title and risk of loss transfers upon delivery of EXONDYS 51 to our U.S. Customers' facilities. Our U.S. Customers subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. During 2017, we commenced shipment of eteplirsen to a distributor in the E.U. under our MAP, and title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor upon shipment of eteplirsen to their customers. Additionally, we started shipment of eteplirsen to the distributors in Israel and Middle East on a named patient basis, and title and risk of loss transfers to the distributors when their first carriers pick up the drug products. Product revenue generated from these programs were immaterial in 2017. We provide no right of return to any customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect.\nProduct revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates and discounts, Public Health Service ( PHS\u201d) chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. We establish reserves for Medicaid rebates, PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. In addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services, we classify these payments within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nRevenue from research contracts and other grants\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are generally cost plus contracts providing for reimbursed costs which include overhead, general and administrative costs and a target fee. We recognize revenue from U.S. government research contracts during the period in which the related expenses are incurred and present such revenues and related expenses on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. Our government contracts are subject to government audits, which may result in catch-up adjustments. As of December 31, 2014, we had completed all development activities of our contracts with the U.S. government. The majority of the revenue under our U.S. government contracts was recognized as of December 31, 2015 and only revenue for contract finalization, if any, is expected in the future.\nDeferred revenue\nWe defer recognition of non-refundable up-front fees if we have continuing performance obligations when the technology, right, product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non-refundable fee has no utility to the licensee. In addition, if we have continuing involvement through research and development services that are required because of our know-how or because the services can only be performed by us, such up-front fees are deferred and recognized over the period of continuing involvement. As of December 31, 2017, we had deferred revenue of $3.3 million, which primarily represents up-front fees we may recognize as revenue upon settlement of certain obligations.\nPlease read Note 7, Accounts Receivable and Reserves for Product Sales to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of revenue recognition.\nInventory\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products upon regulatory approval. Prior to regulatory approval, we expense costs incurred to manufacture our drug products that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016 following the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51, we began to capitalize inventory costs associated with EXONDYS 51 when it was determined that the inventory had a probable future economic benefit. Additionally, we periodically analyze our inventory levels, and write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAll research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and are comprised of:\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and other entities in connection with the conduct of clinical trials and preclinical trials and related services, such as data management, laboratory and biostatistics services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing APIs for product candidates that have not received regulatory approval;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fees and costs related to regulatory filings and activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> facilities, depreciation and other expenses, including rent, utilities, maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhen third-party service providers' billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of our drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. We base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period and past history, where applicable.\nStock Compensation Expense\nWe use the fair value method to determine stock-based compensation expense. To determine the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions which include the award's expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. We recognize the fair value of the portion of the awards expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight-line basis for the entire award. Stock awards granted to employees vest over a four-year period and have a ten-year term. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation expense represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Please read Note 14, Stock-Based Compensation to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of stock-based compensation.\nIncome Tax\nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. To date, the Company has not had any earnings in its non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered and settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero because it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination.\nThe TJCA was enacted on December 22, 2017. The TJCA reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB118 directs taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as provisional\u201d when it does not have the necessary information available to prepare or analyze (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law.\nAt December 31, 2017, we made reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing U.S. deferred tax balances and the corresponding valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized no transition tax, have remeasured deferred taxes, and our reassessment of permanently reinvested earnings, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances. These estimates may be impacted by the need for further analysis and future clarification and guidance regarding available tax accounting methods and elections, earnings and profits computations, and state tax conformity to federal tax changes.\nPlease read Note 2, Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nResults of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December

discount, co-pay and distribution fees. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results are different from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which will have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nWe recognize revenue from U.S. government research contracts and grants during the period in which the related expenses are incurred and present such revenues and related expenses on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. Our government contracts are subject to government audits, which may result in catch-up adjustments. As of December 31, 2014, we had completed all development activities of our contracts with the U.S. government. The majority of the revenue under our U.S. government contracts was recognized as of December 31, 2015 and only revenue for contract finalization, if any, is expected in the future.\nNet product revenues for EXONDYS 51 for 2017 increased by $149.2 million compared with 2016. The increase primarily reflects increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.\nNet product revenues for EXONDYS 51 was $5.4 million in 2016. These revenues related to sales of EXONDYS 51 following the September 2016 commercial launch of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. Revenue from research contracts and other grants decreased by $1.3 million in 2016, or 100% compared with 2015, as all of the work related to government grants was completed prior to 2016. Only revenue from contract finalization, if any, is expected to be recognized in future periods.\nCost of Sales\nOur cost of sales relates to sales of EXONDYS 51 following its commercial launch in the U.S. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51 from the FDA in September 2016, we expensed such manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For EXONDYS 51 sold in 2017 and 2016, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51. The following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty payments to BioMarin\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory costs related to release testing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory costs related to EXONDYS 51 sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other inventory costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*NM: not meaningful\nThe cost of sales for 2017 increased $7.3 million compared with 2016. The increase primarily reflects royalty payments to BioMarin as a result of the execution of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin in July 2017 as well as increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 during 2017. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to receiving FDA approval, the inventory costs related EXONDYS 51 sold in 2017 and 2016 would have been approximately $8.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting preclinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility costs.\nResearch and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects.\nThe following table summarizes

The up-front and milestone payments decreased by $26.0 million. In 2017, we made a $22.0 million payment to Summit as a result of achieving the milestone of the last patient being dosed in the safety arm cohort to the PhaseOut DMD study. In 2016, we made $40.0 million and $7.0 million up-front payments to Summit and UWA, respectively, as a result of the execution of their respective license agreements in 2016. Additionally, clinical and manufacturing expenses decreased by $6.3 million because of the capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 by the FDA partially offset by increased patient enrollment in our on-going late stage clinical trials. Further, the year over year reduction in research and development expenses was also driven by decreases of $1.8 million in restructuring expenses as a majority of activities of the restructuring plans implemented in 2016 were completed prior to 2017 and $1.0 million in stock-based compensation. The decreases were partially offset by increases of $6.0 million in preclinical expenses as a result of a ramp-up of preclinical trials in our PPMO platform and other follow-on exons, $4.3 million in compensation and other personnel expenses as a result of a net increase in headcount and $2.6 million in professional services.\nResearch and development expenses for 2016 increased by $41.9 million, or 29%, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $47.5 million in up-front and milestone payments related to the Collaboration Agreement with Summit and the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement and its First Amendment with UWA, $2.0 million in restructuring expenses, and $1.1 million in clinical and manufacturing expenses due to increased patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses because of the capitalization of inventory upon the approval of EXONDYS 51 by the FDA. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $4.4 million in compensation and other personnel expenses, $1.8 million in facility-related expenses and $0.9 million in stock-based compensation primarily driven by decreases in headcount.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions.

The increase was primarily due to $25.3 million in professional services driven by increased legal fees because of on-going litigations and global commercial expansion, $7.1 million in compensation and other personnel expenses due to net increase in headcount, $3.5 million in estimated severance due to the resignation of our former CEO and $1.2 million in facility-related expenses.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased by $8.7 million, or 12%, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases of $12.3 million in compensation and other personnel expenses, $8.1 million in stock-based compensation and $1.8 million in facility-related expenses. These increases were primarily driven by increases in commercial headcount. Additionally, we also incurred $2.5 million in restructuring expenses in 2016. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $9.2 million in severance expense related to the resignation of our former CEO in March 2015 and $6.4 million in professional services primarily due to lower litigation activities.\nSettlement and License Charges\nIn July 2017, we and BioMarin executed a license agreement, pursuant to which the BioMarin Parties granted us a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights and know-how controlled by the BioMarin Parties with respect to the BioMarin Parties' DMD program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of DMD, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen. In addition, in July 2017, we and UWA on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties AZL on the other hand, executed a settlement agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Under the terms of the License Agreement and the Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make total up-front payments of $35.0 million upon execution of these agreements, consisting of $20.0 million under the Settlement Agreement and $15.0 million under the License Agreement. Additionally, we may be liable for up to approximately $65.0 million in regulatory and sales milestones for eteplirsen as well as exon 45 and exon 53 skipping product candidates. The BioMarin Parties will also be eligible to receive royalty payments, ranging from 4% - 8%, which will expire in December 2023 in the U.S. and September 2024 in the EU. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded settlement and license charges of $28.4 million.\nAmortization of In-licensed Rights\nAmortization of in-license rights relate to the two agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2011, respectively. We recorded an in-licensed right asset of approximately $6.6 million as a result of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin. Additionally, following the first sale of EXONDYS 51 in September 2016, we recorded an in-licensed right asset of $1.0 million related to a license agreement with UWA. Both in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the patent from the first commercial sale of EXONDYS 51. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $1.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.\nInterest (expense) income and other, net\nInterest (expense) income and other, net, primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest expense and rental income and loss. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, commercial paper, government and government agency debt securities, money market investments and certificates of deposit. Interest expense includes interest accrued on our convertible notes, term loan, revolving line of credit and mortgage loan related to our Corvallis, Oregon property. Rental income and loss is from leasing excess space in some of our facilities.\nInterest expense and other, net for 2017 increased by $1.6 million compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense incurred in connection with the $570.0 million convertible debt offering.\nInterest expense and other, net for 2016 was $0.5 million compared to interest income and other, net of $0.2 million for 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to interest expense incurred in connection with the $20.0 million senior secured term loan.\nGain from Sale of Priority Review Voucher\nIn February 2017, we entered into an agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. ( Gilead\u201d) to sell our Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher ( PRV\u201d). We received the PRV when EXONDYS 51 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2017, we completed our sale of the PRV to a subsidiary of Gilead. Pursuant to the agreement, the subsidiary of Gilead paid us $125.0 million, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 599,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 477,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 479,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restricted cash and investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,695\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (93\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash, cash equivalents\nand investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,089,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 760,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 431,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 414,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,228,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 373,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 855,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,140,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 842,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*NM: not meaningful\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was from debt and equity financings, sale of the PRV and product sales from EXONDYS 51.

To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated:\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (231,996\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (245,820\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (178,815\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90,193\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (88,622\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 888,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 378,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 509,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 477,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 435,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (245,820\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (149,465\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (96,355\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (90,193\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (98,603\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 378,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 230,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n*NM: not meaningful\nOperating Activities.\nCash used in operating activities decreased by $13.8 million for 2017 compared with 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease of $91.6 million in net loss (excluding the gain from sale of PRV) which was driven by net product revenues for EXONDYS 51 and decreased research and development expenses primarily due to capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Additionally, non-cash adjustments increased by $3.9 million. These were partially offset by unfavorable changes of $81.7 million in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to increases in accounts receivables and inventory as we launched EXONDYS 51.\nCash used in operating activities for 2016 increased by $96.4 million compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $47.2 million in net loss driven by increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses slightly offset by product revenue, an unfavorable change of $47.8 million in operating assets and liabilities due to the timing of certain activities and a decrease in non-cash adjustments of $1.4 million.\nInvesting Activities.\nCash used in investing activities increased by $88.6 million for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases of purchases of $394.1 million of available-for-sale securities, $6.7 million of property and equipment and $7.7 million of intangible assets. The increase was partially offset by increases of proceeds of $184.1 million from maturity of available-for-sale securities, $125.0 million from sales of the PRV and $10.7 million from maturity of a restricted investment.\nCash used in investing activities for 2016 was $90.2 million compared with $8.4 million provided by investing activities in 2015. The change was primarily due to a decrease of $73.8 million in proceeds from the maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, increases of $33.4 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities and $1.9 million in\npurchases of property and equipment. These were offset by a decrease of $10.7 million due to the purchase of a restricted investment in 2015.\nFinancing Activities.\nCash provided by financing activities increased by $510.0 million for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $624.6 million from debt financings partially offset by $50.9 million in purchase of capped call options, an increase of $47.2 million in repayment of outstanding debts and decreases of $5.7 million in proceeds from exercise of options and employee stock purchase program and $10.8 million in proceeds from sales of common stock.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2016 increased by $230.3 million compared with 2015. In June and September 2016, we sold approximately 5.8 million and 2.1 million shares of common stock, generating net proceeds of $327.4 million and $37.3 million, respectively, $244.9 million higher than the prior year's equity offering. Additionally, net proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase program was $10.0 million higher than 2015. The increases were partially offset by $5.0 million of repayments of long-term debt and notes payable and a decrease of $19.6 million in proceeds from our senior long-term secured loan.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose.\nContractual Payment Obligations\nIn our continuing operations, we have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and acquisition of technology access rights, among others.

Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or sales milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2017, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and sales milestones.\nOther Funding Commitments\nWe have several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $52.9 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nPlease read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Cost of Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was from debt and equity financings, sale of the PRV and product sales from EXONDYS 51.

The majority of the revenue under our U.S. government contracts was recognized as of December 31, 2015 and only revenue for contract finalization, if any, is expected in the future.\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial assets:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 599,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 122,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 477,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Short-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 479,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 195,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 283,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restricted cash and investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,695\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (93\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash, cash equivalents\nand investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,089,824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 329,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 760,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 30,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 400,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total borrowings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 431,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 414,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,228,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 373,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 855,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total working capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,140,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 298,054\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 842,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. To date, the Company has not had any earnings in its non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nWe defer recognition of non-refundable up-front fees if we have continuing performance obligations when the technology, right, product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non-refundable fee has no utility to the licensee. In addition, if we have continuing involvement through research and development services that are required because of our know-how or because the services can only be performed by us, such up-front fees are deferred and recognized over the period of continuing involvement. As of December 31, 2017, we had deferred revenue of $3.3 million, which primarily represents up-front fees we may recognize as revenue upon settlement of certain obligations.\n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, including rent, utilities, maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies. \nCash used in operating activities for 2016 increased by $96.4 million compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $47.2 million in net loss driven by increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses slightly offset by product revenue, an unfavorable change of $47.8 million in operating assets and liabilities due to the timing of certain activities and a decrease in non-cash adjustments of $1.4 million.\nIncome Tax\nRevenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer has been reasonably assured.\nPMO-based compounds are highly resistant to degradation by enzymes, potentially enabling robust and sustained biological activity. In contrast to other RNA-targeted therapeutics, which are usually designed to down-regulate protein expression, our technologies are designed to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate protein expression, and more importantly, create novel proteins. PMO-based compounds have demonstrated inhibition of mRNA translation and alteration of pre-mRNA splicing. PMO-based compounds have the potential to reduce off-target effects, such as the immune stimulation often observed with ribose-based RNA technologies. We believe that our highly differentiated, novel, proprietary and innovative RNA-targeted PMO-based platforms may represent a significant improvement over other RNA-targeted technologies. In addition, PMO-based compounds are highly adaptable molecules: with minor structural modifications, they can potentially be rapidly designed to target specific tissues, genetic sequences, or pathogens, and therefore, we believe they could potentially be applied to treat a broad spectrum of diseases.\nWe have revised the presentation as well as the caption of certain items in research and development by project table to conform to the current period presentation. SRP-5051\u201d of $0.6 million was reclassified from other projects\u201d and presented separately in the table. This reclassification had no impact on total research and development expenses.\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year Ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Royalty payments to BioMarin\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory costs related to release testing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Inventory costs related to EXONDYS 51 sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other inventory costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of sales\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,252\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NM*\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nRevenues\nProduct revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates and discounts, Public Health Service ( PHS\u201d) chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. We establish reserves for Medicaid rebates, PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. In addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services, we classify these payments within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and development expenses for 2016 increased by $41.9 million, or 29%, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $47.5 million in up-front and milestone payments related to the Collaboration Agreement with Summit and the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement and its First Amendment with UWA, $2.0 million in restructuring expenses, and $1.1 million in clinical and manufacturing expenses due to increased patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses because of the capitalization of inventory upon the approval of EXONDYS 51 by the FDA. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $4.4 million in compensation and other personnel expenses, $1.8 million in facility-related expenses and $0.9 million in stock-based compensation primarily driven by decreases in headcount.\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payment Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term Loan (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,340\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 628,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 586,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loan (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lease obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 81,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations and contingencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 775,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses.

As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects.\nSettlement and License Charges\nIn July 2017, we and BioMarin executed a license agreement, pursuant to which the BioMarin Parties granted us a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights and know-how controlled by the BioMarin Parties with respect to the BioMarin Parties' DMD program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of DMD, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen. In addition, in July 2017, we and UWA on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties AZL on the other hand, executed a settlement agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Under the terms of the License Agreement and the Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make total up-front payments of $35.0 million upon execution of these agreements, consisting of $20.0 million under the Settlement Agreement and $15.0 million under the License Agreement. Additionally, we may be liable for up to approximately $65.0 million in regulatory and sales milestones for eteplirsen as well as exon 45 and exon 53 skipping product candidates. The BioMarin Parties will also be eligible to receive royalty payments, ranging from 4% - 8%, which will expire in December 2023 in the U.S. and September 2024 in the EU. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded settlement and license charges of $28.4 million.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation expense represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Please read Note 14, Stock-Based Compensation to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of stock-based compensation.\non our business and results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution.\nAll research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and are comprised of:\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nOur first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\nPlease read Note 2, Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting preclinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility costs.\nWe are currently approved to sell EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. We distribute our product principally through a limited number of specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies (collectively, U.S. Customers\u201d). Title and risk of loss transfers upon delivery of EXONDYS 51 to our U.S. Customers' facilities. Our U.S. Customers subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. During 2017, we commenced shipment of eteplirsen to a distributor in the E.U. under our MAP, and title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor upon shipment of eteplirsen to their customers. Additionally, we started shipment of eteplirsen to the distributors in Israel and Middle East on a named patient basis, and title and risk of loss transfers to the distributors when their first carriers pick up the drug products. Product revenue generated from these programs were immaterial in 2017. We provide no right of return to any customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased by $8.7 million, or 12%, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases of $12.3 million in compensation and other personnel expenses, $8.1 million in stock-based compensation and $1.8 million in facility-related expenses. These increases were primarily driven by increases in commercial headcount. Additionally, we also incurred $2.5 million in restructuring expenses in 2016. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $9.2 million in severance expense related to the resignation of our former CEO in March 2015 and $6.4 million in professional services primarily due to lower litigation activities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated:\nDeferred revenue\n \u2022 Casimersen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or skipping\u201d, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.\nInterest expense and other, net for 2017 increased by $1.6 million compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense incurred in connection with the $570.0 million convertible debt offering.\n (1) Interest is included. \nWe have developed proprietary state-of-the-art manufacturing and techniques that allow synthesis and purification of our product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based products and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these techniques to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhances our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have own internal manufacturing capabilities to produce our product and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by category for each of the periods indicated:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n*NM: not meaningful\nInterest expense and other, net for 2016 was $0.5 million compared to interest income and other, net of $0.2 million for 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to interest expense incurred in connection with the $20.0 million senior secured term loan.\n \u2022 the attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments to BioMarin, Summit, UWA and other institutions; \n \u2022 the timing of advanced payments related to our future inventory commitments; \nThe TJCA was enacted on December 22, 2017. The TJCA reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB118 directs taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as provisional\u201d when it does not have the necessary information available to prepare or analyze (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law.\nNet product revenues for EXONDYS 51 for 2017 increased by $149.2 million compared with 2016. The increase primarily reflects increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.\nStock Compensation Expense\nWe use the fair value method to determine stock-based compensation expense. To determine the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions which include the award's expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. We recognize the fair value of the portion of the awards expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight-line basis for the entire award. Stock awards granted to employees vest over a four-year period and have a ten-year term. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic medicine approaches for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases.\nResearch and development expenses for 2017 decreased by $21.6 million, or 11%, compared with 2016. The up-front and milestone payments decreased by $26.0 million. In 2017, we made a $22.0 million payment to Summit as a result of achieving the milestone of the last patient being dosed in the safety arm cohort to the PhaseOut DMD study. In 2016, we made $40.0 million and $7.0 million up-front payments to Summit and UWA, respectively, as a result of the execution of their respective license agreements in 2016. Additionally, clinical and manufacturing expenses decreased by $6.3 million because of the capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 by the FDA partially offset by increased patient enrollment in our on-going late stage clinical trials. Further, the year over year reduction in research and development expenses was also driven by decreases of $1.8 million in restructuring expenses as a majority of activities of the restructuring plans implemented in 2016 were completed prior to 2017 and $1.0 million in stock-based compensation. The decreases were partially offset by increases of $6.0 million in preclinical expenses as a result of a ramp-up of preclinical trials in our PPMO platform and other follow-on exons, $4.3 million in compensation and other personnel expenses as a result of a net increase in headcount and $2.6 million in professional services.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n*NM: not meaningful\nPlease read Note 7, Accounts Receivable and Reserves for Product Sales to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of revenue recognition.\nRevenue from research contracts and other grants\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose.\nOur next generation PMO-based chemistries include PPMO, PMO-X\u00ae and PMOplus\u00ae. PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates is well tolerated and results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Preclinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMO, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle.\n \u2022 Golodirsen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. Golodirsen is designed to bind to exon 53 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or skipping\u201d, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 53 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered and settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero because it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination.\n \u2022 repayment of outstanding debts and \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n*NM: not meaningful\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe cost of sales for 2017 increased $7.3 million compared with 2016. The increase primarily reflects royalty payments to BioMarin as a result of the execution of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin in July 2017 as well as increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 during 2017. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to receiving FDA approval, the inventory costs related EXONDYS 51 sold in 2017 and 2016 would have been approximately $8.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n \u2022 income tax. \nInvesting Activities.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 increased by $38.9 million, or 46%, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to $25.3 million in professional services driven by increased legal fees because of on-going litigations and global commercial expansion, $7.1 million in compensation and other personnel expenses due to net increase in headcount, $3.5 million in estimated severance due to the resignation of our former CEO and $1.2 million in facility-related expenses.\nCash used in investing activities increased by $88.6 million for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases of purchases of $394.1 million of available-for-sale securities, $6.7 million of property and equipment and $7.7 million of intangible assets. The increase was partially offset by increases of proceeds of $184.1 million from maturity of available-for-sale securities, $125.0 million from sales of the PRV and $10.7 million from maturity of a restricted investment.\n\n \u2022 Duke University, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 technology for muscular dystrophy under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement that grants us rights to certain of Duke University's intellectual property for CRISPR/Cas9; and \n \u2022 EXONDYS 51, our first product, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. EXONDYS51 is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \nThe likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace, the risks associated with government sponsored programs and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2016 increased by $230.3 million compared with 2015. In June and September 2016, we sold approximately 5.8 million and 2.1 million shares of common stock, generating net proceeds of $327.4 million and $37.3 million, respectively, $244.9 million higher than the prior year's equity offering. Additionally, net proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase program was $10.0 million higher than 2015. The increases were partially offset by $5.0 million of repayments of long-term debt and notes payable and a decrease of $19.6 million in proceeds from our senior long-term secured loan.\nIn our continuing operations, we have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and acquisition of technology access rights, among others. The following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of December 31, 2017:\n*NM: not meaningful\n \u2022 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing APIs for product candidates that have not received regulatory approval; \nOther Funding Commitments\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; \nOur RNA-targeted technologies work at the most fundamental level of biology and potentially could have a meaningful impact across a broad range of human diseases and disorders. Our lead program focuses on the development of disease-modifying therapeutic candidates for DMD, a rare genetic muscle-wasting disease caused by the absence of dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscle function. The basis of our novel RNA-targeted therapeutics is the PMO.\n \u2022 research and development expense; \nOperating Activities.\nInterest (expense) income and other, net\nApplying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative RNA-targeted platform technologies, we are able to develop candidate therapies for a broad range of diseases and disorders.\nA summary description of our product and main product candidates is as follows:\n \u2022 fees and expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and other entities in connection with the conduct of clinical trials and preclinical trials and related services, such as data management, laboratory and biostatistics services; \n \u2022 the timing and costs of building out our manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 Nationwide Children's Hospital, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of (1) their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a research and exclusive license option agreement and (2) their Galgt2 gene therapy program under an exclusive license agreement; \nCash used in operating activities decreased by $13.8 million for 2017 compared with 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease of $91.6 million in net loss (excluding the gain from sale of PRV) which was driven by net product revenues for EXONDYS 51 and decreased research and development expenses primarily due to capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Additionally, non-cash adjustments increased by $3.9 million. These were partially offset by unfavorable changes of $81.7 million in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to increases in accounts receivables and inventory as we launched EXONDYS 51.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we received clearance from the FDA and commenced a first in human, single ascending dose, study for our PPMO for the treatment of DMD in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping (SRP-5051). We expect to have data regarding safety and future dosing for SRP-5051 in the second half of 2018. In addition to SRP-5051, our 2018 plans currently include IND-enabling pre-clinical work on 5 additional PPMOs.\n \u2022 SRP-5051, one of our main product candidates, uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. SRP-5051, a peptide conjugated PMO, is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \n\nGolodirsen, an exon 53-skipping product candidate, is currently in the clinic as part of a Phase 1/2 study. Part I has been completed and Part II, an open label portion of this study, is ongoing (Study 4053-101). In September 2017, we announced positive results of an analysis that included biopsies of the bicep muscle at baseline and on-treatment at the Part II, Week 48 time point. The study results demonstrated statistical significance on all primary and secondary biological endpoints.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAt December 31, 2017, we made reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing U.S. deferred tax balances and the corresponding valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized no transition tax, have remeasured deferred taxes, and our reassessment of permanently reinvested earnings, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances. These estimates may be impacted by the need for further analysis and future clarification and guidance regarding available tax accounting methods and elections, earnings and profits computations, and state tax conformity to federal tax changes.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n \u2022 the timing and costs associated with our global expansion; \nRevenue Recognition\n\nOur cash requirements are expected to continue to increase as we advance our research, development and commercialization programs and we expect to seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity, debt securities or the licensing or sale of our technologies. We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect\nIn addition, pursuant to an ongoing Sarepta-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial studying casimersen (Study 4045-101), we have completed a dose titration portion (Phase 1) and are currently conducting the open-label portion of the study (Phase 2).\n \u2022 Genethon, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement; \nIn addition to advancing our exon-skipping product candidates for DMD, we are working with several strategic partners under various agreements to research and develop multiple treatment approaches to DMD. These strategic partners include:\nCash used in investing activities for 2016 was $90.2 million compared with $8.4 million provided by investing activities in 2015. The change was primarily due to a decrease of $73.8 million in proceeds from the maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, increases of $33.4 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities and $1.9 million in\n \u2022 the timing and costs associated with our clinical trials and preclinical trials; \nContractual Payment Obligations\n \u2022 up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred; \nNet product revenues for EXONDYS 51 was $5.4 million in 2016. These revenues related to sales of EXONDYS 51 following the September 2016 commercial launch of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. Revenue from research contracts and other grants decreased by $1.3 million in 2016, or 100% compared with 2015, as all of the work related to government grants was completed prior to 2016. Only revenue from contract finalization, if any, is expected to be recognized in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses by category for each of the periods indicated:\nInterest (expense) income and other, net, primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest expense and rental income and loss. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, commercial paper, government and government agency debt securities, money market investments and certificates of deposit. Interest expense includes interest accrued on our convertible notes, term loan, revolving line of credit and mortgage loan related to our Corvallis, Oregon property. Rental income and loss is from leasing excess space in some of our facilities.\nOur cost of sales relates to sales of EXONDYS 51 following its commercial launch in the U.S. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51 from the FDA in September 2016, we expensed such manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For EXONDYS 51 sold in 2017 and 2016, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51. The following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and our other intellectual property rights. \nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by project for each of the periods indicated:\nWe are in the process of conducting, starting or planning various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with regulatory NDA and/or MAA filing requirements as well as studies we need to conduct to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe clinical benefit.\nResults of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nPlease read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor product candidates that are currently in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $808.5 million of future development, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or sales milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2017, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and sales milestones.\n\nWe record product revenue net of applicable discounts and allowances which include Medicaid rebates, PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discount, co-pay and distribution fees. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results are different from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which will have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\n \u2022 revenue recognition; \n (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding or subject to cancellation fees and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to our commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and clinical programs for DMD. \n\nWe are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (Study 4045-301), our phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively.\nWe have several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $52.9 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts.\nGain from Sale of Priority Review Voucher\nFinancing Activities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,089.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $599.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $479.4 million of short-term investments, $10.0 million of long-term investments and $0.8 million of long-term restricted cash and investments. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months.\nAmortization of In-licensed Rights\nCash provided by financing activities increased by $510.0 million for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $624.6 million from debt financings partially offset by $50.9 million in purchase of capped call options, an increase of $47.2 million in repayment of outstanding debts and decreases of $5.7 million in proceeds from exercise of options and employee stock purchase program and $10.8 million in proceeds from sales of common stock.\nThe following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated:\nAmortization of in-license rights relate to the two agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2011, respectively. We recorded an in-licensed right asset of approximately $6.6 million as a result of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin. Additionally, following the first sale of EXONDYS 51 in September 2016, we recorded an in-licensed right asset of $1.0 million related to a license agreement with UWA. Both in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the patent from the first commercial sale of EXONDYS 51. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $1.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are generally cost plus contracts providing for reimbursed costs which include overhead, general and administrative costs and a target fee. We recognize revenue from U.S. government research contracts during the period in which the related expenses are incurred and present such revenues and related expenses on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. Our government contracts are subject to government audits, which may result in catch-up adjustments. As of December 31, 2014, we had completed all development activities of our contracts with the U.S. government. The majority of the revenue under our U.S. government contracts was recognized as of December 31, 2015 and only revenue for contract finalization, if any, is expected in the future.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products upon regulatory approval. Prior to regulatory approval, we expense costs incurred to manufacture our drug products that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016 following the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51, we began to capitalize inventory costs associated with EXONDYS 51 when it was determined that the inventory had a probable future economic benefit. Additionally, we periodically analyze our inventory levels, and write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.\nOur future expenditures and capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:\nIn February 2017, we entered into an agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. ( Gilead\u201d) to sell our Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher ( PRV\u201d). We received the PRV when EXONDYS 51 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2017, we completed our sale of the PRV to a subsidiary of Gilead. Pursuant to the agreement, the subsidiary of Gilead paid us $125.0 million, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale.\n*NM: not meaningful\n\nInventory\nProduct revenue, net\n *NM: not meaningful \nWhen third-party service providers' billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of our drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. We base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period and past history, where applicable.\n \u2022 fees and costs related to regulatory filings and activities; \nMilestone Obligations\n \u2022 our ability to continue to generate revenues from sales of EXONDYS 51 and potential future products; \n \u2022 stock-based compensation; and \nCash Flows", "item_7_text": "Cost of Sales\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was from debt and equity financings, sale of the PRV and product sales from EXONDYS 51. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was from equity financings and product sales. Our principal uses of cash are research and development expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses, investments, capital expenditures, business development transactions and other working capital requirements.\npurchases of property and equipment. These were offset by a decrease of $10.7 million due to the purchase of a restricted investment in 2015.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity for each of the periods indicated:\nWe recognize revenue from U.S. government research contracts and grants during the period in which the related expenses are incurred and present such revenues and related expenses on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. Our government contracts are subject to government audits, which may result in catch-up adjustments. As of December 31, 2014, we had completed all development activities of our contracts with the U.S. government. The majority of the revenue under our U.S. government contracts was recognized as of December 31, 2015 and only revenue for contract finalization, if any, is expected in the future.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Please review our legend titled Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K which is incorporated herein by reference. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed below. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those identified below, and those discussed in the section titled Risk Factors\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Throughout this discussion, unless the context specifies or implies otherwise, the terms Sarepta\u201d, we\u201d, us\u201d and our\u201d refer to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc. and its subsidiaries.\nOverview\n \u2022 Summit, with whom we are collaborating under an exclusive License and Collaboration Agreement that grants us exclusive rights to Summit's utrophin modulator pipeline, including ezutromid, in Europe, Turkey and the Commonwealth of Independent States and an option to acquire rights in Latin America. \n \u2022 Inventory; \nThe Company follows the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. It is the intention of the Company to reinvest the earnings of its non-U.S. subsidiaries in those operations and not to repatriate the earnings to the U.S. Accordingly, the Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the financial reporting over the tax basis in its investments in foreign subsidiaries as they are considered permanent in duration. To date, the Company has not had any earnings in its non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nWe defer recognition of non-refundable up-front fees if we have continuing performance obligations when the technology, right, product or service conveyed in conjunction with the non-refundable fee has no utility to the licensee. In addition, if we have continuing involvement through research and development services that are required because of our know-how or because the services can only be performed by us, such up-front fees are deferred and recognized over the period of continuing involvement. As of December 31, 2017, we had deferred revenue of $3.3 million, which primarily represents up-front fees we may recognize as revenue upon settlement of certain obligations.\n \u2022 facilities, depreciation and other expenses, including rent, utilities, maintenance of facilities, insurance and other supplies. \nCash used in operating activities for 2016 increased by $96.4 million compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $47.2 million in net loss driven by increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses slightly offset by product revenue, an unfavorable change of $47.8 million in operating assets and liabilities due to the timing of certain activities and a decrease in non-cash adjustments of $1.4 million.\nIncome Tax\nRevenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred and title of the product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer, the price is fixed or determinable and collection from the customer has been reasonably assured.\nPMO-based compounds are highly resistant to degradation by enzymes, potentially enabling robust and sustained biological activity. In contrast to other RNA-targeted therapeutics, which are usually designed to down-regulate protein expression, our technologies are designed to selectively up-regulate or down-regulate protein expression, and more importantly, create novel proteins. PMO-based compounds have demonstrated inhibition of mRNA translation and alteration of pre-mRNA splicing. PMO-based compounds have the potential to reduce off-target effects, such as the immune stimulation often observed with ribose-based RNA technologies. We believe that our highly differentiated, novel, proprietary and innovative RNA-targeted PMO-based platforms may represent a significant improvement over other RNA-targeted technologies. In addition, PMO-based compounds are highly adaptable molecules: with minor structural modifications, they can potentially be rapidly designed to target specific tissues, genetic sequences, or pathogens, and therefore, we believe they could potentially be applied to treat a broad spectrum of diseases.\nWe have revised the presentation as well as the caption of certain items in research and development by project table to conform to the current period presentation. SRP-5051\u201d of $0.6 million was reclassified from other projects\u201d and presented separately in the table. This reclassification had no impact on total research and development expenses.\n\nRevenues\nProduct revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates and discounts, Public Health Service ( PHS\u201d) chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. We establish reserves for Medicaid rebates, PHS chargebacks, prompt payment discounts, co-pay assistance and distribution fees. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Reserves established for these discounts and allowances are classified as reductions of accounts receivable (if the amount is payable to our customer) or a liability (if the amount is payable to a party other than our customer). Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. If actual results vary, we may need to adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of the adjustment. In addition to the discounts and rebates described above and classified as a reduction of revenue, we also maintain certain customer service contracts with customers in the distribution channel that provide us with inventory management, data and distribution services, which are generally accounted for as a reduction of revenue. To the extent we can demonstrate a separable benefit and fair value for these services, we classify these payments within selling, general and administrative expenses.\nResearch and development expenses for 2016 increased by $41.9 million, or 29%, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $47.5 million in up-front and milestone payments related to the Collaboration Agreement with Summit and the Amended and Restated UWA License Agreement and its First Amendment with UWA, $2.0 million in restructuring expenses, and $1.1 million in clinical and manufacturing expenses due to increased patient enrollment in our ongoing clinical trials, partially offset by lower manufacturing expenses because of the capitalization of inventory upon the approval of EXONDYS 51 by the FDA. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $4.4 million in compensation and other personnel expenses, $1.8 million in facility-related expenses and $0.9 million in stock-based compensation primarily driven by decreases in headcount.\nResearch and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We do not maintain or evaluate and, therefore, do not allocate internal research and development costs on a project-by-project basis. As a result, a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, as the costs may benefit multiple projects.\nSettlement and License Charges\nIn July 2017, we and BioMarin executed a license agreement, pursuant to which the BioMarin Parties granted us a royalty-bearing, worldwide license under patent rights and know-how controlled by the BioMarin Parties with respect to the BioMarin Parties' DMD program, which are potentially necessary or useful for the treatment of DMD, to practice and exploit the Licensed Patents and Licensed Know-How in all fields of use and for all purposes, including to develop and commercialize antisense oligonucleotide products that target one or more exons of the dystrophin gene to induce exon skipping, including eteplirsen. In addition, in July 2017, we and UWA on the one hand, and the BioMarin Parties AZL on the other hand, executed a settlement agreement pursuant to which all legal actions in the U.S. and certain legal actions in Europe would be stopped or withdrawn as between the Settlement Parties. Under the terms of the License Agreement and the Settlement Agreement, we agreed to make total up-front payments of $35.0 million upon execution of these agreements, consisting of $20.0 million under the Settlement Agreement and $15.0 million under the License Agreement. Additionally, we may be liable for up to approximately $65.0 million in regulatory and sales milestones for eteplirsen as well as exon 45 and exon 53 skipping product candidates. The BioMarin Parties will also be eligible to receive royalty payments, ranging from 4% - 8%, which will expire in December 2023 in the U.S. and September 2024 in the EU. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded settlement and license charges of $28.4 million.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock-based compensation expense represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment. As a result, if factors change and we use different assumptions, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. Please read Note 14, Stock-Based Compensation to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of stock-based compensation.\non our business and results of operations. To the extent we issue additional equity securities, our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution.\nAll research and development expenses are expensed as incurred and are comprised of:\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods presented. Some of these judgments can be subjective and complex, and, consequently, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe that the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon historical experience and information available to us at the time that we make these estimates and judgments. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected. Although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate, actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\nOur first commercial product in the U.S., EXONDYS 51, was granted accelerated approval by the FDA on September 19, 2016. EXONDYS 51 is indicated for the treatment of DMD in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 51 skipping. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification of a clinical benefit in confirmatory trials.\nPlease read Note 2, Summary Of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates.\nResearch and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities as well as costs associated with our product development efforts, conducting preclinical trials, clinical trials and manufacturing activities. Direct research and development expenses associated with our programs include clinical trial site costs, clinical manufacturing costs, costs incurred for consultants, up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use, and other external services, such as data management and statistical analysis support, and materials and supplies used in support of clinical programs. Indirect costs of our clinical programs include salaries, stock-based compensation and allocation of our facility costs.\nWe are currently approved to sell EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. We distribute our product principally through a limited number of specialty distributor and specialty pharmacies (collectively, U.S. Customers\u201d). Title and risk of loss transfers upon delivery of EXONDYS 51 to our U.S. Customers' facilities. Our U.S. Customers subsequently resell our products to patients and health care providers. During 2017, we commenced shipment of eteplirsen to a distributor in the E.U. under our MAP, and title and risk of loss transfers to the distributor upon shipment of eteplirsen to their customers. Additionally, we started shipment of eteplirsen to the distributors in Israel and Middle East on a named patient basis, and title and risk of loss transfers to the distributors when their first carriers pick up the drug products. Product revenue generated from these programs were immaterial in 2017. We provide no right of return to any customers except in cases of shipping error or product defect.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2016 increased by $8.7 million, or 12%, compared with 2015. The increase was primarily due to increases of $12.3 million in compensation and other personnel expenses, $8.1 million in stock-based compensation and $1.8 million in facility-related expenses. These increases were primarily driven by increases in commercial headcount. Additionally, we also incurred $2.5 million in restructuring expenses in 2016. The increases were partially offset by decreases of $9.2 million in severance expense related to the resignation of our former CEO in March 2015 and $6.4 million in professional services primarily due to lower litigation activities.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated:\nDeferred revenue\n \u2022 Casimersen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 45 of the DMD gene. Casimersen is designed to bind to exon 45 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or skipping\u201d, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 45 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation and related costs for personnel in our executive, finance, legal, information technology, business development, human resources, commercial and other general and administrative functions. Other general and administrative expenses include an allocation of our facility costs and professional fees for legal, consulting and accounting services.\nInterest expense and other, net for 2017 increased by $1.6 million compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in interest expense incurred in connection with the $570.0 million convertible debt offering.\n (1) Interest is included. \nWe have developed proprietary state-of-the-art manufacturing and techniques that allow synthesis and purification of our product candidates to support both clinical development as well as commercialization. Our current main focus in manufacturing is to continue scaling up production of our PMO-based products and optimizing manufacturing for PPMO. We have entered into certain manufacturing and supply arrangements with third-party suppliers which will in part utilize these techniques to support production of certain of our product candidates and their components. In 2017, we opened a facility in Andover, Massachusetts, which significantly enhances our research and development manufacturing capabilities. However, we currently do not have own internal manufacturing capabilities to produce our product and product candidates for commercial and/or clinical use.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by category for each of the periods indicated:\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n*NM: not meaningful\nInterest expense and other, net for 2016 was $0.5 million compared to interest income and other, net of $0.2 million for 2015. The unfavorable change was primarily due to interest expense incurred in connection with the $20.0 million senior secured term loan.\n \u2022 the attainment of milestones and our obligations to make milestone payments to BioMarin, Summit, UWA and other institutions; \n \u2022 the timing of advanced payments related to our future inventory commitments; \nThe TJCA was enacted on December 22, 2017. The TJCA reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. On December 22, 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( SAB 118\u201d). SAB118 directs taxpayers to consider the impact of the U.S. legislation as provisional\u201d when it does not have the necessary information available to prepare or analyze (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete its accounting for the change in tax law.\nNet product revenues for EXONDYS 51 for 2017 increased by $149.2 million compared with 2016. The increase primarily reflects increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 in the U.S.\nStock Compensation Expense\nWe use the fair value method to determine stock-based compensation expense. To determine the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant, we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the use of subjective assumptions which include the award's expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock. We recognize the fair value of the portion of the awards expected to vest as expense over the requisite vesting periods on a straight-line basis for the entire award. Stock awards granted to employees vest over a four-year period and have a ten-year term. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of unique RNA-targeted therapeutics, gene therapy and other genetic medicine approaches for the treatment of rare neuromuscular diseases.\nResearch and development expenses for 2017 decreased by $21.6 million, or 11%, compared with 2016. The up-front and milestone payments decreased by $26.0 million. In 2017, we made a $22.0 million payment to Summit as a result of achieving the milestone of the last patient being dosed in the safety arm cohort to the PhaseOut DMD study. In 2016, we made $40.0 million and $7.0 million up-front payments to Summit and UWA, respectively, as a result of the execution of their respective license agreements in 2016. Additionally, clinical and manufacturing expenses decreased by $6.3 million because of the capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 by the FDA partially offset by increased patient enrollment in our on-going late stage clinical trials. Further, the year over year reduction in research and development expenses was also driven by decreases of $1.8 million in restructuring expenses as a majority of activities of the restructuring plans implemented in 2016 were completed prior to 2017 and $1.0 million in stock-based compensation. The decreases were partially offset by increases of $6.0 million in preclinical expenses as a result of a ramp-up of preclinical trials in our PPMO platform and other follow-on exons, $4.3 million in compensation and other personnel expenses as a result of a net increase in headcount and $2.6 million in professional services.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n*NM: not meaningful\nPlease read Note 7, Accounts Receivable and Reserves for Product Sales to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further discussion of revenue recognition.\nRevenue from research contracts and other grants\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or for another contractually narrow or limited purpose.\nOur next generation PMO-based chemistries include PPMO, PMO-X\u00ae and PMOplus\u00ae. PPMO features covalent attachment of a cell-penetrating peptide to a PMO with the goal of enhanced delivery into the cell. In pre-clinical research, our proprietary class of PPMO compounds demonstrated an increase in dystrophin production and a more durable response compared to PMO. In addition, PPMO treatment in non-human primates is well tolerated and results in high levels of exon-skipping in skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. Preclinical trials also indicate that PPMOs may require less frequent dosing than PMO, and that PPMOs could potentially be tailored to reach other organs beyond muscle.\n \u2022 Golodirsen, one of our main product candidates, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 53 of the DMD gene. Golodirsen is designed to bind to exon 53 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion, or skipping\u201d, of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 53 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered and settled. A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the net deferred tax asset to zero because it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will not be realized. The Company recognizes the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained upon an examination.\n \u2022 repayment of outstanding debts and \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\n*NM: not meaningful\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThe cost of sales for 2017 increased $7.3 million compared with 2016. The increase primarily reflects royalty payments to BioMarin as a result of the execution of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin in July 2017 as well as increasing demand for EXONDYS 51 during 2017. If product related costs had not previously been expensed as research and development expenses prior to receiving FDA approval, the inventory costs related EXONDYS 51 sold in 2017 and 2016 would have been approximately $8.6 million and $0.5 million, respectively.\n \u2022 income tax. \nInvesting Activities.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for 2017 increased by $38.9 million, or 46%, compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to $25.3 million in professional services driven by increased legal fees because of on-going litigations and global commercial expansion, $7.1 million in compensation and other personnel expenses due to net increase in headcount, $3.5 million in estimated severance due to the resignation of our former CEO and $1.2 million in facility-related expenses.\nCash used in investing activities increased by $88.6 million for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily due to increases of purchases of $394.1 million of available-for-sale securities, $6.7 million of property and equipment and $7.7 million of intangible assets. The increase was partially offset by increases of proceeds of $184.1 million from maturity of available-for-sale securities, $125.0 million from sales of the PRV and $10.7 million from maturity of a restricted investment.\n\n \u2022 Duke University, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of gene editing CRISPR/Cas9 technology for muscular dystrophy under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement that grants us rights to certain of Duke University's intellectual property for CRISPR/Cas9; and \n \u2022 EXONDYS 51, our first product, uses our PMO chemistry and exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. EXONDYS51 is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \nThe likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties and delays frequently encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace, the risks associated with government sponsored programs and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations.\nCash provided by financing activities in 2016 increased by $230.3 million compared with 2015. In June and September 2016, we sold approximately 5.8 million and 2.1 million shares of common stock, generating net proceeds of $327.4 million and $37.3 million, respectively, $244.9 million higher than the prior year's equity offering. Additionally, net proceeds from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase program was $10.0 million higher than 2015. The increases were partially offset by $5.0 million of repayments of long-term debt and notes payable and a decrease of $19.6 million in proceeds from our senior long-term secured loan.\nIn our continuing operations, we have entered into long-term contractual arrangements from time to time for our facilities, the provision of goods and services, and acquisition of technology access rights, among others. The following table presents contractual obligations arising from these arrangements as of December 31, 2017:\n*NM: not meaningful\n \u2022 the cost of acquiring, developing and manufacturing APIs for product candidates that have not received regulatory approval; \nOther Funding Commitments\n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, bonuses, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense; \nOur RNA-targeted technologies work at the most fundamental level of biology and potentially could have a meaningful impact across a broad range of human diseases and disorders. Our lead program focuses on the development of disease-modifying therapeutic candidates for DMD, a rare genetic muscle-wasting disease caused by the absence of dystrophin, a protein necessary for muscle function. The basis of our novel RNA-targeted therapeutics is the PMO.\n \u2022 research and development expense; \nOperating Activities.\nInterest (expense) income and other, net\nApplying our proprietary, highly-differentiated and innovative RNA-targeted platform technologies, we are able to develop candidate therapies for a broad range of diseases and disorders.\nA summary description of our product and main product candidates is as follows:\n \u2022 fees and expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and other entities in connection with the conduct of clinical trials and preclinical trials and related services, such as data management, laboratory and biostatistics services; \n \u2022 the timing and costs of building out our manufacturing capabilities; \n \u2022 Nationwide Children's Hospital, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of (1) their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a research and exclusive license option agreement and (2) their Galgt2 gene therapy program under an exclusive license agreement; \nCash used in operating activities decreased by $13.8 million for 2017 compared with 2016. This was primarily due to a decrease of $91.6 million in net loss (excluding the gain from sale of PRV) which was driven by net product revenues for EXONDYS 51 and decreased research and development expenses primarily due to capitalization of inventory following the approval of EXONDYS 51 partially offset by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. Additionally, non-cash adjustments increased by $3.9 million. These were partially offset by unfavorable changes of $81.7 million in operating assets and liabilities primarily related to increases in accounts receivables and inventory as we launched EXONDYS 51.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, we received clearance from the FDA and commenced a first in human, single ascending dose, study for our PPMO for the treatment of DMD in patients who are amenable to exon 51 skipping (SRP-5051). We expect to have data regarding safety and future dosing for SRP-5051 in the second half of 2018. In addition to SRP-5051, our 2018 plans currently include IND-enabling pre-clinical work on 5 additional PPMOs.\n \u2022 SRP-5051, one of our main product candidates, uses our next-generation chemistry platform, PPMO, and our exon-skipping technology to skip exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. SRP-5051, a peptide conjugated PMO, is designed to bind to exon 51 of dystrophin pre-mRNA, resulting in exclusion of this exon during mRNA processing in patients with genetic mutations that are amenable to exon 51 skipping. Exon skipping is intended to promote the production of an internally truncated but functional dystrophin protein. \n\nGolodirsen, an exon 53-skipping product candidate, is currently in the clinic as part of a Phase 1/2 study. Part I has been completed and Part II, an open label portion of this study, is ongoing (Study 4053-101). In September 2017, we announced positive results of an analysis that included biopsies of the bicep muscle at baseline and on-treatment at the Part II, Week 48 time point. The study results demonstrated statistical significance on all primary and secondary biological endpoints.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nAt December 31, 2017, we made reasonable estimates of the effects on its existing U.S. deferred tax balances and the corresponding valuation allowance. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized no transition tax, have remeasured deferred taxes, and our reassessment of permanently reinvested earnings, uncertain tax positions and valuation allowances. These estimates may be impacted by the need for further analysis and future clarification and guidance regarding available tax accounting methods and elections, earnings and profits computations, and state tax conformity to federal tax changes.\nResearch and Development Expenses\n \u2022 the timing and costs associated with our global expansion; \nRevenue Recognition\n\nOur cash requirements are expected to continue to increase as we advance our research, development and commercialization programs and we expect to seek additional financings primarily from, but not limited to, the sale and issuance of equity, debt securities or the licensing or sale of our technologies. We cannot provide assurances that financing will be available when and as needed or that, if available, the financings will be on favorable or acceptable terms. If we are unable to obtain additional financing when and if we require, this would have a material adverse effect\nIn addition, pursuant to an ongoing Sarepta-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial studying casimersen (Study 4045-101), we have completed a dose titration portion (Phase 1) and are currently conducting the open-label portion of the study (Phase 2).\n \u2022 Genethon, with whom we are collaborating on the advancement of their micro-dystrophin gene therapy program under a sponsored research and exclusive license option agreement; \nIn addition to advancing our exon-skipping product candidates for DMD, we are working with several strategic partners under various agreements to research and develop multiple treatment approaches to DMD. These strategic partners include:\nCash used in investing activities for 2016 was $90.2 million compared with $8.4 million provided by investing activities in 2015. The change was primarily due to a decrease of $73.8 million in proceeds from the maturities and sales of available-for-sale securities, increases of $33.4 million in purchases of available-for-sale securities and $1.9 million in\n \u2022 the timing and costs associated with our clinical trials and preclinical trials; \nContractual Payment Obligations\n \u2022 up-front fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies which have not reached technological feasibility and do not have an alternative future use are expensed when incurred; \nNet product revenues for EXONDYS 51 was $5.4 million in 2016. These revenues related to sales of EXONDYS 51 following the September 2016 commercial launch of EXONDYS 51 in the U.S. Revenue from research contracts and other grants decreased by $1.3 million in 2016, or 100% compared with 2015, as all of the work related to government grants was completed prior to 2016. Only revenue from contract finalization, if any, is expected to be recognized in future periods.\nThe following table summarizes our selling, general and administrative expenses by category for each of the periods indicated:\nInterest (expense) income and other, net, primarily consists of interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments, interest expense and rental income and loss. Our cash equivalents and investments consist of money market funds, commercial paper, government and government agency debt securities, money market investments and certificates of deposit. Interest expense includes interest accrued on our convertible notes, term loan, revolving line of credit and mortgage loan related to our Corvallis, Oregon property. Rental income and loss is from leasing excess space in some of our facilities.\nOur cost of sales relates to sales of EXONDYS 51 following its commercial launch in the U.S. Prior to receiving regulatory approval for EXONDYS 51 from the FDA in September 2016, we expensed such manufacturing and material costs as research and development expenses. For EXONDYS 51 sold in 2017 and 2016, the majority of related manufacturing costs incurred had previously been expensed as research and development expenses, as such costs were incurred prior to the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51. The following table summarizes the components of our cost of sales for the periods indicated:\n \u2022 the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and our other intellectual property rights. \nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses by project for each of the periods indicated:\nWe are in the process of conducting, starting or planning various EXONDYS 51 clinical trials, including studies that are required to comply with regulatory NDA and/or MAA filing requirements as well as studies we need to conduct to comply with our post-marketing FDA requirements/commitments to verify and describe clinical benefit.\nResults of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015\nPlease read Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor product candidates that are currently in various research and development stages, we may be obligated to make up to $808.5 million of future development, up-front royalty and sales milestone payments associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of certain development, regulatory or sales milestones. Because the achievement of these milestones is not probable and payment is not required as of December 31, 2017, such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development, regulatory approval and sales milestones.\n\nWe record product revenue net of applicable discounts and allowances which include Medicaid rebates, PHS chargebacks, prompt pay discount, co-pay and distribution fees. These reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements. Actual amounts may ultimately differ from our estimates. If actual results are different from our estimates, we adjust these estimates, which will have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\n \u2022 revenue recognition; \n (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding or subject to cancellation fees and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to our commercialization of EXONDYS 51 and clinical programs for DMD. \n\nWe are enrolling and dosing patients in ESSENCE (Study 4045-301), our phase 3 placebo controlled confirmatory trial in patients who have a confirmed mutation of the DMD gene that is amenable to exon 45 or 53 skipping using casimersen and golodirsen, respectively.\nWe have several on-going clinical trials in various clinical trial stages. Our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to CROs. The CRO contracts are generally cancellable at our option. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $52.9 million in cancellable future commitments based on existing CRO contracts.\nGain from Sale of Priority Review Voucher\nFinancing Activities.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,089.9 million of cash, cash equivalents and investments, consisting of $599.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $479.4 million of short-term investments, $10.0 million of long-term investments and $0.8 million of long-term restricted cash and investments. We believe that our balance of cash, cash equivalents and investments is sufficient to fund our current operational plan for at least the next twelve months.\nAmortization of In-licensed Rights\nCash provided by financing activities increased by $510.0 million for 2017 compared with 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $624.6 million from debt financings partially offset by $50.9 million in purchase of capped call options, an increase of $47.2 million in repayment of outstanding debts and decreases of $5.7 million in proceeds from exercise of options and employee stock purchase program and $10.8 million in proceeds from sales of common stock.\nThe following table summarizes our financial condition for each of the periods indicated:\nAmortization of in-license rights relate to the two agreements we entered into with BioMarin and UWA in July 2017 and April 2011, respectively. We recorded an in-licensed right asset of approximately $6.6 million as a result of the settlement and license agreements with BioMarin. Additionally, following the first sale of EXONDYS 51 in September 2016, we recorded an in-licensed right asset of $1.0 million related to a license agreement with UWA. Both in-licensed rights are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the patent from the first commercial sale of EXONDYS 51. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded amortization of in-licensed rights of approximately $1.1 million and less than $0.1 million, respectively.\nOur contracts with the U.S. government are generally cost plus contracts providing for reimbursed costs which include overhead, general and administrative costs and a target fee. We recognize revenue from U.S. government research contracts during the period in which the related expenses are incurred and present such revenues and related expenses on a gross basis in the consolidated financial statements. Our government contracts are subject to government audits, which may result in catch-up adjustments. As of December 31, 2014, we had completed all development activities of our contracts with the U.S. government. The majority of the revenue under our U.S. government contracts was recognized as of December 31, 2015 and only revenue for contract finalization, if any, is expected in the future.\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value, on a first-in, first-out basis. We capitalize inventory costs associated with our products upon regulatory approval. Prior to regulatory approval, we expense costs incurred to manufacture our drug products that could potentially be available to support the commercial launch of our products. Beginning in the third quarter of 2016 following the FDA approval of EXONDYS 51, we began to capitalize inventory costs associated with EXONDYS 51 when it was determined that the inventory had a probable future economic benefit. Additionally, we periodically analyze our inventory levels, and write down inventory that has become obsolete, inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its estimated net realizable value and inventory in excess of expected sales requirements as cost of sales. The determination of whether inventory costs will be realizable requires estimates by management. If actual market conditions are less favorable than projected by management, additional write-downs of inventory may be required.\nOur future expenditures and capital requirements may be substantial and will depend on many factors, including but not limited to the following:\nIn February 2017, we entered into an agreement with Gilead Sciences, Inc. ( Gilead\u201d) to sell our Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher ( PRV\u201d). We received the PRV when EXONDYS 51 was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with DMD amenable to exon 51 skipping. Following the early termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, in March 2017, we completed our sale of the PRV to a subsidiary of Gilead. Pursuant to the agreement, the subsidiary of Gilead paid us $125.0 million, which was recorded as a gain from sale of the PRV as it did not have a carrying value at the time of the sale.\n*NM: not meaningful\n\nInventory\nProduct revenue, net\n *NM: not meaningful \nWhen third-party service providers' billing terms do not coincide with our period-end, we are required to make estimates of our obligations to those third parties, including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs, contractual services costs and costs for supply of our drug candidates, incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at the end of the period. We base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs, services performed for the period and past history, where applicable.\n \u2022 fees and costs related to regulatory

operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Some key points:\n\n- Sarepta is a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on RNA-targeted therapeutics for rare diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Its lead product is Exondys 51 for treating DMD patients amenable to exon 51 skipping.\n\n- In 2017, Sarepta had $154.6 million in net product revenue, primarily from Exondys 51 sales, compared to just $5.4 million in 2016. The increase reflects the continued launch and uptake of Exondys 51 in the U.S. \n\n- R&D expenses were $166.7 million in 2017, down 11% from 2016, mainly due to lower upfront and milestone payments. SG&A expenses rose 46% to $122.7 million due to costs related to the Exondys 51 launch.\n\n- Net loss in 2017 was $50.7 million compared to a $267.3 million net loss in 2016, primarily due to Exondys 51 revenue.\n\n- Cash and investments totaled $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017, providing funding for continued operations for at least 12 months. Main uses of cash are R&D and SG&A expenses.\n\n- Key financial metrics and results are driven by Exondys 51 commercialization, advancement of pipeline candidates like golodirsen, overall operating expenses, and financing activities.\n\nIn summary, the report provides an overview of Sarepta's improved financial performance in 2017 driven by the launch of Exondys 51, while continuing to invest significantly in R&D. The company is well funded for the next 12 months."}
