Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.\nThe accounting estimates discussed below are considered by us to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 should be read in conjunction with this section to assist with obtaining an understanding of the underlying accounting policies related to these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, equity, business, and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.\nInsurance Reserves\nInsurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts are primarily related to long term care policies and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future premium rate increases. The reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves-Estimates and Uncertainties section below.\nReinsurance and Insurance Receivables\nExposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities we have ceded under reinsurance agreements. An allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, industry experience and current economic conditions. Further information on our reinsurance receivables is in Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nAdditionally, exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from policyholders related to insurance contracts, including amounts due from insureds under high deductible policies and retrospectively rated policies. An allowance for uncollectible insurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, currently as well as in the future, management's experience and current economic conditions.\nIf actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for uncollectible reinsurance and insurance receivables, net receivables as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets may not be collected. Therefore, our results of operations or equity could be materially adversely affected.\nValuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities\nWe classify our fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, which are both carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. Further information on our fair value measurements is in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. Factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. Significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends and whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Further information on our process for evaluating impairments is in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nLong Term Care Policies\nFuture policy benefit reserves for our long term care policies are based on certain assumptions, including morbidity, persistency, inclusive of mortality, discount rates and future premium rate increases. The adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves.\nA prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving discount rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to our reserves. In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the premium rate increases we request.\nThese changes to our reserves could materially adversely impact our results of operations and equity. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section below.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities. Any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. In addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited, resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.\nRESERVES - ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES\nThe level of reserves we maintain represents our best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that we derive, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. As noted below, we review our reserves for each segment of our business periodically, and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. Further information on reserves is provided in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nProperty and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\nWe maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). IBNR includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading Insurance Reserves.\u201d Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the Segment Results section of this MD&A and in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nAs discussed in the Risk Factors discussion within Item 1A, there is a risk that our recorded reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses. Unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.\nIn addition, our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses. To mitigate the risks posed by our exposure to A&EP claims and claim adjustment expenses, we completed a transaction with NICO under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO effective January 1, 2010. See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion about the transaction with NICO, its impact on our results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain.\nEstablishing Property & Casualty Reserve Estimates\nIn developing claim and claim adjustment expense ( loss\u201d or losses\u201d) reserve estimates, our actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized at a reserve group level. A reserve group can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as aging services, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. Every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, we review actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.\nMost of our business can be characterized as long-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. Our long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. Specialty, Commercial and International contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. Corporate & Other contains long-tail exposures.\nVarious methods are used to project ultimate losses for both long-tail and short-tail exposures.\nThe paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy years with further expected changes in paid losses. Selection of the paid loss pattern may require\nconsideration of several factors, including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can affect the results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in their adequacy.\nFor many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers' compensation.\nThe incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.\nThe loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. This method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio method. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. This method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. For long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.\nThe frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that affect the number and size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors, including the rate at which policyholders report claims to us, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing\nproperty, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.\nStochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular reserve group being modeled. For some reserve groups, we use models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. In either case, multiple simulations using varying assumptions are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. The results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.\nFor many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, our actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of our products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, we may not assign much if any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. We may use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner, primarily because our history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, we may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.\nFor other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, we use additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.\nPeriodic Reserve Reviews\nThe reserve analyses performed by our actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. Senior management considers many factors in making this decision. Our recorded reserves reflect our best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts and circumstances, consideration of the factors cited above and our judgment. The carried reserve differs from the actuarial point estimate as discussed further below.\nCurrently, our recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For Commercial, Specialty and International, the difference between our reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment which may adversely affect claim costs and the effects from the economy. For Corporate & Other, the difference between our reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.\nThe key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve groups and accident or policy years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.\nOur recorded reserves are management's best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability associated with our net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting our reserve estimates for particular types of business. These significant factors are the ones that we believe could most likely materially affect the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of business for which we believe a material deviation to our reserves is reasonably possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on our reserves.\nThe three areas for which we believe a significant deviation to our net reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability and surety products; (ii) workers' compensation; and (iii) general liability.\nProfessional liability, management liability and surety products include professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. They also include directors and officers (D&O), employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the healthcare delivery system. The most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also affect claim severity. If the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, we estimate that net reserves would increase by approximately $450 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, we estimate that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. Our net reserves for these products were approximately $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nFor workers' compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, the most significant factor affecting workers' compensation reserve estimates is claim cost inflation on claim payments. Workers' compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers' compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, we estimate that our net reserves would increase by approximately $350 million. If estimated workers' compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, we estimate that our net reserves would decrease by approximately $350 million. Our net reserves for workers' compensation were approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nFor general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, we estimate that our net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. If the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, we estimate that our net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. Our net reserves for general liability were approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nGiven the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation. As a result, we regularly review the adequacy of our reserves and reassess our reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods. In reviewing our reserve estimates, we make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. These reviews have resulted in our identification of information and trends that have caused us to change our reserves in prior periods and could lead to our identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. See discussion within Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for additional information about reserve development and the Ratings section of this MD&A for further information regarding our financial strength and corporate debt ratings.\nLife & Group Policyholder Reserves\nOur Life & Group segment includes our run-off long term care business as well as structured settlement obligations not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. Long term care policies provide benefits for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. Generally, policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force and we have the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.\nWe maintain both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefit reserves for policyholder benefits for our Life & Group segment. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have\nbeen incurred but are not yet reported. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for our long term care policies, our actuaries perform a detailed claim experience study on an annual basis. The study reviews the sufficiency of existing reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. Our recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect management's best estimate after incorporating the results of the most recent study. In addition, claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are also maintained for the structured settlement obligations.\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to our long term care policies and are the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium. The determination of these reserves is fundamental to our financial results and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. The assumptions used to determine the active life reserves were unlocked as of December 31, 2015 in connection with the recognition of a premium deficiency. Since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.\nThe actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency, discount rate and anticipated future premium rate increases. Persistency can be affected by policy lapses, benefit reductions and death. Discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility and may also be affected by changes to the Internal Revenue Code. There is limited historical company and industry data available to us for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a portion of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. As a result of this variability, our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to our expectations.\nAnnually, management assesses the adequacy of its long term care future policy benefit reserves by performing a gross premium valuation (GPV) to determine if there is a premium deficiency. Management also uses the GPV process to evaluate the adequacy of the claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for structured settlement obligations. Under the GPV, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. The GPV required reserves are then compared to the recorded reserves. If the GPV required reserves are greater than the existing recorded reserves, the existing assumptions are unlocked and future policy benefit reserves are increased to the greater amount. Any such increase is reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity and business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. Periodically, management engages independent third parties to assess the appropriateness of its best estimate assumptions and the associated GPV required reserves. The most recent assessment by an independent third party was performed in 2017.\nThe December 31, 2017 GPV indicated our recorded reserves included a margin of approximately $246 million. A summary of the changes in the estimated reserve margin is presented in the table below:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long Term Care Active Life Reserve - Change in estimated reserve margin (In millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2016 Estimated Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>255\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in underlying discount rate assumptions (excl. Tax Reform Legislation)\n</td> <td>(270\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in underlying discount rate assumptions (Tax Reform Legislation Impact)\n</td> <td>(1,048\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in underlying morbidity assumptions\n</td> <td>972\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in underlying persistency assumptions\n</td> <td>(7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in underlying premium rate action assumptions\n</td> <td>157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Changes in underlying expense and other assumptions\n</td> <td>187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017 Estimated Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the margin in 2017 was driven by the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the tax equivalent yield on the tax exempt municipal bonds in the investment portfolio supporting the long term care liabilities. A continuation of the low interest rate environment also drove a reduction in the discount rate assumptions. These unfavorable drivers were mostly offset by favorable changes\nto the underlying morbidity assumptions, both frequency and severity, higher than expected rate increases on active rate action programs and favorable changes to the underlying expense assumptions.\nThe annual long term care claim experience study resulted in a release of $42 million from claim reserves driven by favorable frequency and severity relative to expectations.\nThe table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on our results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to our active life reserve assumptions. The annual GPV process involves updating all assumptions to the then current best estimate, and historically all significant assumptions have been revised each year. In the Hypothetical Revisions table below, we have assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the other assumptions. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. Any required increase in the recorded reserves resulting from the hypothetical revision in the table below would first reduce the margin in our carried reserves before it would affect results of operations. Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized below. The estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of the existing margin.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Estimated reduction to pretax income\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hypothetical revisions (In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Morbidity:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5% increase in morbidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>408\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10% increase in morbidity\n</td> <td>1,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Persistency:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5% decrease in active life mortality and lapse\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>10% decrease in active life mortality and lapse\n</td> <td>219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount Rates:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50 basis point decline in future interest rates\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>100 basis point decline in future interest rates\n</td> <td>633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium Rate Actions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>50% decrease in anticipated future rate increases premium\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs reflected in the Long Term Care Active Life Reserve - Change in estimated reserve margin table on the preceding page, the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate adversely affected the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which we discount our long term care active life reserves. Any future reduction in income tax rates could further adversely affect our GPV discount rates.\nCATASTROPHE REINSURANCE\nGroup North American Property Treaty\nThe Company purchases corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance covering its U.S. states and territories and Canadian property exposures underwritten in our North American and non-Lloyds European companies. The treaty has a term of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The 2018 treaty provides coverage for the accumulation of losses from catastrophe occurrences above the Company's per occurrence retention of $250 million up to $1.0 billion, with 10% co-participation on the first $650 million above the retention and 20% co-participation on the top $100 million layer. Losses stemming from terrorism events are covered unless they are due to a nuclear, biological or chemical attack. All layers of the treaty provide for one full reinstatement.\nGroup Workers Compensation Treaty\nThe Company also purchases corporate Workers Compensation catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 providing $275 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to natural catastrophes above the Company retention of $25 million. The treaty also provides $475 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to terrorism events above the Company retention of $25 million. Of this $475 million in Terrorism coverage, $200 million is provided for nuclear, biological chemical and radiation events. One full reinstatement is available for the first $275 million above the retention, regardless of the covered peril. The Company also purchases a targeted facultative facility to address exposure accumulations in specific peak Terrorism zones.\nCONSOLIDATED OPERATIONS\nWhat we previously referred to as Net operating income (loss) in our public disclosures, we now refer to as Core income (loss). With this terminology change, we removed Non-Core from the titles of our Life & Group and Corporate & Other segments to avoid confusion.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018,\u201d previously known as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d was signed into law (Tax Reform Legislation). The Tax Reform Legislation provides for a permanent reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among other provisions. As a result, we recorded a one-time non-cash increase to Income tax expense of $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nWe expect the overall provisions of the Tax Reform Legislation will have a positive impact on future periods by lowering the effective tax rate and increasing after-tax earnings, primarily due to the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate. The reduction in income taxes will also enhance cash flow.\nAlthough the Tax Reform Legislation initially reduced our combined statutory surplus in the period of enactment, statutory surplus remains well above minimum regulatory requirements and dividend capacity was not significantly affected.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table includes the consolidated results of our operations including our financial measure, Core income. For more detailed components of our business operations and the core income financial measure, see the segment discussions within this MD&A. For further discussion of Net investment income and Net realized investment results, see the Investments section of this MD&A.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,921\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>2,034\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenues\n</td> <td>427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>9,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,316\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Claims, Benefits and Expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net incurred claims and benefits\n</td> <td>5,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policyholders' dividends\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of deferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td>1,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other insurance related expenses\n</td> <td>1,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,122\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses\n</td> <td>591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>589\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>535\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total claims, benefits and expenses\n</td> <td>8,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,229\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core income before income tax\n</td> <td>1,217\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>616\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense on core income\n</td> <td>(298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(263\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(101\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core income\n</td> <td>919\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>824\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>515\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(67\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit on net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>(30\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net realized investment gains (losses), after tax\n</td> <td>63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net deferred tax asset remeasurement\n</td> <td>(83\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>899\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>479\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared with 2016\nCore income increased $95 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. Core income for our Property & Casualty Operations declined $23 million primarily driven by higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Net catastrophe losses were $259 million after tax in 2017 as compared to $111 million after tax in 2016. Core loss for our operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations improved $118 million driven by lower adverse prior year A&EP reserve development.\nFavorable net prior year development of $312 million and $314 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016 related to our Specialty, Commercial, International and Corporate & Other segments. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nCore income increased $309 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. Core results increased $293 million for our operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations primarily as a result of a $198 million after-tax charge in 2015 related to increasing long term care active life and claim reserves. As our active life reserve assumptions were unlocked in 2015, long term care results in 2016 improved significantly. Core income increased $16 million for our Property & Casualty Operations due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development and net investment income, partially offset by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses. Net catastrophe losses were $111 million after tax in 2016 as compared to $95 million after tax in 2015.\nFavorable net prior year development of $314 million and $218 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015 related to our Specialty, Commercial, International and Corporate & Other segments. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe following discusses the results of operations for our business segments.\nOur property and casualty commercial insurance operations are managed and reported in three business segments: Specialty, Commercial and International, which we refer to collectively as Property & Casualty Operations. Specialty provides a broad array of professional, financial and specialty property and casualty products and services through a network of independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters. Commercial includes property and casualty coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and organizations primarily through an independent agency distribution system. Commercial also includes commercial insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations primarily through insurance brokers. International provides management and professional liability coverages as well as a broad range of other property and casualty insurance products and services abroad through a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters, as well as the Lloyd's marketplace.\nEffective January 1, 2018, management is changing the segment presentation of our life sciences business and technology and media related errors and omissions (E&O) business within the Specialty and Commercial business segments. Our life sciences business provides product liability and other coverages such as property and workers compensation associated with the life sciences industry. Approximately $100 million of net written premium related to the life sciences business will move from the Specialty business segment to the Commercial business segment. Our technology and media related E&O business provides network security and privacy, media and E&O coverage primarily for technology risks. Approximately $70 million of net written premium related to this business will move from the Commercial business segment to the Specialty business segment. We believe the new management responsibility for these businesses better aligns with line of business underwriting expertise and the manner in which the products are sold. The new classifications will be presented in the Company's financial statements beginning with the period ending March 31, 2018, and prior periods presented will conform to the new presentation.\nOur operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations are managed and reported in two segments: Life & Group and Corporate & Other. Life & Group primarily includes the results of our long term care business that is in run-off. Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP. Intersegment eliminations are also included in this segment.\nOur Property & Casualty Operations field structure consists of 49 underwriting locations across the United States. In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities and also act as call centers to optimize service. Our claim presence consists of six primary locations where we handle multiple claim types and key business functions. Additionally, claim maintains regional offices which are aligned with our underwriting field structure. We also have a presence in Canada, Europe and Singapore consisting of 17 branch operations and access to business placed at Lloyd's of London through Hardy Syndicate 382.\nWhat we previously referred to as net operating income (loss) in our public disclosures, we now refer to as core income (loss). The fourth quarter 2017 net deferred tax asset remeasurement was excluded from core income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. Otherwise, there were no changes to the calculation of this measure. We utilize the core income (loss) financial measure to monitor our operations. Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of i) net realized investment gains or losses, ii) income or loss from discontinued operations, iii) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance and iv) deferred tax asset and liability remeasurement as a result of an enacted U.S. Federal tax rate change. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net realized investment gains or losses because net realized investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not considered an indication of trends in insurance operations. Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure. See further discussion regarding how we manage our business and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and other information in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nIn evaluating the results of our Specialty, Commercial and International segments, we utilize the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio and the combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results.\nThe loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders' dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. In addition we also utilize renewal premium change, rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. Renewal premium change, rate and retention presented for the prior year are updated to reflect subsequent activity on policies written in the period. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.\nChanges in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and premium accruals, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year development within this MD&A. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. Net prior year development does not include the effect of related acquisition expenses. Further information on our reserves is provided in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nSpecialty\nSpecialty provides management and professional liability and other coverages through property and casualty products and services using a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters. Specialty includes the following business groups:\nManagement & Professional Liability provides management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages. This group provides professional liability coverages to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. Management & Professional Liability also provides D&O, employment practices, fiduciary and fidelity coverages. Specific areas of focus include small and mid-size firms, public as well as privately held firms and not-for-profit organizations, where tailored products for these client segments are offered. Products within Management & Professional Liability are distributed through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Management & Professional Liability also offers insurance products to serve the healthcare industry. Products include professional and general liability as well as associated standard property and casualty coverages, and are distributed on a national basis through brokers, independent agents and managing general underwriters. Key customer groups include aging services, allied medical facilities, life sciences, dentists, physicians, hospitals and nurses and other medical practitioners.\nSurety offers small, medium and large contract and commercial surety bonds. Surety provides surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a network of independent agencies and brokers.\nWarranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles and cell phones.\nThe following table details the results of operations for Specialty.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except ratios, rate, renewal premium change and retention)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>2,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core income\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other performance metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio\n</td> <td>55.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense ratio\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend ratio\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>88.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal premium change\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retention\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet written premiums for Specialty in 2017 were consistent with 2016. New business, renewal premium change and retention also remained at consistent levels. The decrease in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nCore income decreased $40 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher net investment income.\nThe combined ratio increased 3.0 points in 2017 as compared with 2016. The loss ratio increased 3.0 points primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $49 million, or 1.8 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $18 million, or 0.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 1.3 points. The expense ratio in 2017 was consistent with the same period in 2016.\nFavorable net prior year development of $216 million and $305 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for Specialty.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross case reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,805\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross IBNR reserves\n</td> <td>4,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,848\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net case reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,656\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,681\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net IBNR reserves\n</td> <td>3,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 Compared with 2015\nNet written premiums for Specialty in 2016 were consistent with 2015 as growth in warranty was offset by a decrease in management and professional liability and healthcare due to underwriting actions undertaken in certain business lines. The trend in net earned premiums was consistent with net written premiums.\nCore income increased $90 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development and net investment income partially offset by higher underwriting expenses and current accident year net loss and loss adjustment expenses.\nThe combined ratio decreased 3.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. The loss ratio decreased 4.6 points due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development partially offset by a higher current accident year loss ratio. Net catastrophe losses were $18 million, or 0.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2016 as compared to $13 million, or 0.4 points of the loss ratio, for 2015. The expense ratio increased 0.9 points in 2016 as compared with 2015, due to higher employee costs and higher IT spending primarily related to new underwriting platforms.\nFavorable net prior year development of $305 million and $152 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nCommercial\nCommercial works with a network of brokers and independent agents to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products and services to small, middle-market and large businesses. Property products include standard and excess property, marine and boiler and machinery coverages. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products such as workers' compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, we also offer specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs and total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace. These property and casualty products are offered through our Middle Market, Small Business and Other Commercial insurance groups.\nThe following table details the results of operations for Commercial.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except ratios, rate, renewal premium change and retention)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,882\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>2,840\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,804\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,788\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>638\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>593\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core income\n</td> <td>341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>369\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other performance metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio\n</td> <td>67.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense ratio\n</td> <td>35.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend ratio\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>103.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal premium change\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retention\n</td> <td>86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>78\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>520\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared with 2016\nNet written premiums for Commercial increased $41 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 driven by higher new business within Middle Markets, strong retention and positive renewal premium change. This was partially offset by an unfavorable premium rate adjustment within Small Business that is more fully discussed in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. The increase in net earned premium was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nCore income increased $30 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, due to the favorable period over period effect of net prior year loss reserve development and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses.\nThe combined ratio improved 2.1 points in 2017 as compared to 2016. The loss ratio improved 0.8 points primarily due to the favorable period over period effect of net prior year loss reserve development partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $267 million, or 9.4 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $116 million, or 4.1 points of the loss ratio, for 2016.

Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, net written premiums increased 6.7% in 2017. The increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nCore income decreased $13 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 driven by lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by favorable period over period foreign currency exchange results.\nThe combined ratio increased 5.7 points in 2017 as compared with 2016. The loss ratio increased 6.0 points, primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by lower current accident year large losses. Net catastrophe losses were $64 million, or 7.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $31 million, or 3.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 3.0 points. The expense ratio improved 0.3 points in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to the higher net earned premiums.\nFavorable net prior year development of $27 million and $64 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016.

Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, the increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nCore income decreased $16 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to a lower underwriting profit and foreign currency exchange losses.\nThe combined ratio increased 1.5 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. The loss ratio increased 1.5 points, primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven by a higher level of large losses related to political risk, property and financial institutions, partially offset by higher favorable net prior year development. Net catastrophe losses were $31 million, or 3.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2016 primarily driven by the Fort McMurray wildfires, as compared to $27 million, or 3.3 points of the loss ratio, for 2015.

As a result of the reserve assumption unlocking in 2015, the core results of our long term care business in 2016 reflect the variance between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in our best estimate reserves.\nCore income was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by a favorable release of claim reserves resulting from the annual claims experience study and higher net investment income due to an increase in the invested asset base. The long term care results were generally in line with expectations, as the impact of favorable morbidity was partially offset by unfavorable persistency.\nIn 2015, we recognized a $198 million after-tax charge relating to a premium deficiency and claim reserve strengthening. The December 31, 2015 GPV indicated a premium deficiency of $296 million. The indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income that was affected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of $7 million. In 2015, results of our long term care business reflected variances between actual experience and actuarial assumptions that were locked-in at policy issuance.\nCorporate & Other\nCorporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Corporate & Other segment, including intersegment eliminations.\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>152\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>154\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core loss\n</td> <td>(90\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(178\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(137\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2017 Compared with 2016\nCore loss improved $88 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, driven by lower adverse net prior year reserve development recorded in 2017 for A&EP under the Loss Portfolio Transfer.

Our views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions and domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. We also continually monitor exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on our views of a specific issuer or industry sector.\nA further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, we segregate investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long term care and structured settlement liabilities in the Life & Group segment.\nThe effective durations of fixed maturity securities, non-redeemable preferred stock and short term investments are presented in the following table.

This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. This method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. For long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.\nTable

The loss ratio increased 3.6 points due to the unfavorable period over period effect of net prior year reserve development and a higher current accident year loss ratio due to higher large losses. Net catastrophe losses were $116 million, or 4.1 points of the loss ratio, for 2016 primarily driven by U.S. weather-related events, as compared to $101 million, or 3.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2015. The expense ratio increased 0.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015, due to higher employee costs and higher IT spending primarily related to a new underwriting platform.\nThe combined ratio increased 3.0 points in 2017 as compared with 2016. The loss ratio increased 3.0 points primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $49 million, or 1.8 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $18 million, or 0.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 1.3 points.

Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that affect the number and size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors, including the rate at which policyholders report claims to us, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing\nCore income decreased $58 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, due to a higher underwriting loss partially offset by an increase in net investment income.\nThe Life & Group segment primarily includes the results of our long term care business that is in run-off.

In reviewing our reserve estimates, we make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. These reviews have resulted in our identification of information and trends that have caused us to change our reserves in prior periods and could lead to our identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively.

Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that we derive, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. As noted below, we review our reserves for each segment of our business periodically, and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.

Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nFor many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, our actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of our products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, we may not assign much if any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. We may use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner, primarily because our history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, we may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Years ended December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except ratios, rate, renewal premium change and retention)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net written premiums\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earned premiums\n</td> <td>2,753\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,779\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net investment income\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>474\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Core income\n</td> <td>610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>650\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other performance metrics:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio\n</td> <td>55.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expense ratio\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividend ratio\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Combined ratio\n</td> <td>88.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate\n</td> <td>0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Renewal premium change\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retention\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New business\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInsurance Reserves\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross case reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross IBNR reserves\n</td> <td>892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net case reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>640\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>548\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net IBNR reserves\n</td> <td>792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>653\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,201\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nNet written premiums for International in 2016 were consistent with 2015 and includes favorable period over period premium development of $24 million.

Core results increased $293 million for our operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations primarily as a result of a $198 million after-tax charge in 2015 related to increasing long term care active life and claim reserves. As our active life reserve assumptions were unlocked in 2015, long term care results in 2016 improved significantly. Core income increased $16 million for our Property & Casualty Operations due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development and net investment income, partially offset by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses. Net catastrophe losses were $111 million after tax in 2016 as compared to $95 million after tax in 2015.\nThe Company also purchases corporate Workers Compensation catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 providing $275 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to natural catastrophes above the Company retention of $25 million. The treaty also provides $475 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to terrorism events above the Company retention of $25 million. Of this $475 million in Terrorism coverage, $200 million is provided for nuclear, biological chemical and radiation events. One full reinstatement is available for the first $275 million above the retention, regardless of the covered peril. The Company also purchases a targeted facultative facility to address exposure accumulations in specific peak Terrorism zones.\nThe combined ratio increased 5.7 points in 2017 as compared with 2016. The loss ratio increased 6.0 points, primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by lower current accident year large losses. Net catastrophe losses were $64 million, or 7.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $31 million, or 3.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 3.0 points. The expense ratio improved 0.3 points in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to the higher net earned premiums.\nCNA Europe provides a diverse range of specialty products as well as commercial insurance products primarily in the marine, property, financial services and healthcare & technology industries throughout Europe on both a domestic and cross border basis.\nThe actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency, discount rate and anticipated future premium rate increases. Persistency can be affected by policy lapses, benefit reductions and death. Discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility and may also be affected by changes to the Internal Revenue Code. There is limited historical company and industry data available to us for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a portion of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. As a result of this variability, our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to our expectations.\n\nAdditionally, exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from policyholders related to insurance contracts, including amounts due from insureds under high deductible policies and retrospectively rated policies. An allowance for uncollectible insurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, currently as well as in the future, management's experience and current economic conditions.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities. Any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. In addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited, resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.\nCore income decreased $13 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 driven by lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by favorable period over period foreign currency exchange results.\nCorporate & Other\n\n\nReinsurance and Insurance Receivables\nWhat we previously referred to as Net operating income (loss) in our public disclosures, we now refer to as Core income (loss). With this terminology change, we removed Non-Core from the titles of our Life & Group and Corporate & Other segments to avoid confusion.\nNet written premiums for Specialty in 2016 were consistent with 2015 as growth in warranty was offset by a decrease in management and professional liability and healthcare due to underwriting actions undertaken in certain business lines. The trend in net earned premiums was consistent with net written premiums.\nThe table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on our results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to our active life reserve assumptions. The annual GPV process involves updating all assumptions to the then current best estimate, and historically all significant assumptions have been revised each year. In the Hypothetical Revisions table below, we have assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the other assumptions. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. Any required increase in the recorded reserves resulting from the hypothetical revision in the table below would first reduce the margin in our carried reserves before it would affect results of operations. Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized below. The estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of the existing margin.\n(1) To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities supporting long term care products and annuity contracts would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, an increase in Insurance reserves is recorded, net of tax, as a reduction of net unrealized gains through Other comprehensive income (loss) (Shadow Adjustments).\nGroup Workers Compensation Treaty\nSpecialty provides management and professional liability and other coverages through property and casualty products and services using a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters. Specialty includes the following business groups:\nCore income decreased $40 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher net investment income.\nAlthough the Tax Reform Legislation initially reduced our combined statutory surplus in the period of enactment, statutory surplus remains well above minimum regulatory requirements and dividend capacity was not significantly affected.\nProperty and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\nMost of our business can be characterized as long-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. Our long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. Specialty, Commercial and International contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. Corporate & Other contains long-tail exposures.\nNet realized investment gains, after tax, improved $28 million for 2017 as compared with 2016, driven by lower other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses recognized in earnings. Additionally, Short term investments and other for the current period included a loss of $27 million after tax related to the redemption of our $350 million senior notes due November 2019. Net realized investment results, after tax, improved $71 million for 2016 as compared with 2015, driven by lower OTTI losses recognized in earnings and higher net realized investment gains on sales of securities.\n(1) Beginning in 2016, new business includes Hardy. New business for Hardy was $151 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nproperty, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. Factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. Significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends and whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Further information on our process for evaluating impairments is in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThese changes to our reserves could materially adversely impact our results of operations and equity. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section below.\nThe decrease in the margin in 2017 was driven by the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the tax equivalent yield on the tax exempt municipal bonds in the investment portfolio supporting the long term care liabilities. A continuation of the low interest rate environment also drove a reduction in the discount rate assumptions. These unfavorable drivers were mostly offset by favorable changes\nThe effective durations of fixed maturity securities, non-redeemable preferred stock and short term investments are presented in the following table. Amounts presented are net of payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.\nINVESTMENTS\nDue to the recognition of the premium deficiency and resetting of actuarial assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2015, the 2016 and 2015 results are not comparable. As a result of the reserve assumption unlocking in 2015, the core results of our long term care business in 2016 reflect the variance between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in our best estimate reserves.\nThe effective tax rate for the Life & Group segment is generally a function of the Federal corporate income tax rate and the relative proportion of tax exempt investment income on municipal bonds supporting liabilities to the overall pretax income of the segment. The reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 will reduce the tax benefit on the segment's pretax losses.\nNet written premiums for Specialty in 2017 were consistent with 2016. New business, renewal premium change and retention also remained at consistent levels. The decrease in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nEffective January 1, 2018, management is changing the segment presentation of our life sciences business and technology and media related errors and omissions (E&O) business within the Specialty and Commercial business segments. Our life sciences business provides product liability and other coverages such as property and workers compensation associated with the life sciences industry. Approximately $100 million of net written premium related to the life sciences business will move from the Specialty business segment to the Commercial business segment. Our technology and media related E&O business provides network security and privacy, media and E&O coverage primarily for technology risks. Approximately $70 million of net written premium related to this business will move from the Commercial business segment to the Specialty business segment. We believe the new management responsibility for these businesses better aligns with line of business underwriting expertise and the manner in which the products are sold. The new classifications will be presented in the Company's financial statements beginning with the period ending March 31, 2018, and prior periods presented will conform to the new presentation.\n\n2017 Compared with 2016\nIndex to this MD&A\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018,\u201d previously known as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d was signed into law (Tax Reform Legislation). The Tax Reform Legislation provides for a permanent reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among other provisions. As a result, we recorded a one-time non-cash increase to Income tax expense of $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value and net unrealized gains (losses) of our fixed maturity securities by rating distribution.\nOur recorded reserves are management's best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability associated with our net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting our reserve estimates for particular types of business. These significant factors are the ones that we believe could most likely materially affect the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of business for which we believe a material deviation to our reserves is reasonably possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on our reserves.\nFavorable net prior year development of $314 million and $218 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015 related to our Specialty, Commercial, International and Corporate & Other segments. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nCommercial\n2017 Compared with 2016\n\nProfessional liability, management liability and surety products include professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. They also include directors and officers (D&O), employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the healthcare delivery system. The most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also affect claim severity. If the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, we estimate that net reserves would increase by approximately $450 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, we estimate that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. Our net reserves for these products were approximately $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Corporate & Other segment, including intersegment eliminations.\n\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for Corporate & Other.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A Risk Factors, Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nGroup North American Property Treaty\nThe reserve analyses performed by our actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. Senior management considers many factors in making this decision. Our recorded reserves reflect our best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts and circumstances, consideration of the factors cited above and our judgment. The carried reserve differs from the actuarial point estimate as discussed further below.\nAs discussed in the Risk Factors discussion within Item 1A, there is a risk that our recorded reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses. Unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for Commercial.\nThe incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.\nRESERVES - ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe combined ratio decreased 3.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. The loss ratio decreased 4.6 points due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development partially offset by a higher current accident year loss ratio. Net catastrophe losses were $18 million, or 0.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2016 as compared to $13 million, or 0.4 points of the loss ratio, for 2015. The expense ratio increased 0.9 points in 2016 as compared with 2015, due to higher employee costs and higher IT spending primarily related to new underwriting platforms.\nFavorable net prior year development of $27 million and $64 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nA further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, we segregate investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long term care and structured settlement liabilities in the Life & Group segment.\nExposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities we have ceded under reinsurance agreements. An allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, industry experience and current economic conditions. Further information on our reinsurance receivables is in Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\n\nSpecialty\nThe annual long term care claim experience study resulted in a release of $42 million from claim reserves driven by favorable frequency and severity relative to expectations.\n\n\nCore income increased $30 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, due to the favorable period over period effect of net prior year loss reserve development and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses.\nInternational provides property and casualty and specialty coverages on a global basis through its operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Singapore, as well as through its presence at Lloyd's of London.\n\n\nHardy operates through Lloyd's Syndicate 382 underwriting primarily short-tail exposures in energy, marine, property, casualty and specialty lines with risks located in many countries around the world. The capacity of and results from the syndicate are 100% attributable to CNA.\nLife & Group\nFurther information on our realized gains and losses, including our OTTI losses and derivative gains (losses), as well as our impairment decision process, is set forth in Notes A and B to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for Specialty.\nThe loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders' dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. In addition we also utilize renewal premium change, rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. Renewal premium change, rate and retention presented for the prior year are updated to reflect subsequent activity on policies written in the period. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.\nOur operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations are managed and reported in two segments: Life & Group and Corporate & Other. Life & Group primarily includes the results of our long term care business that is in run-off. Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP. Intersegment eliminations are also included in this segment.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.\nOur property and casualty commercial insurance operations are managed and reported in three business segments: Specialty, Commercial and International, which we refer to collectively as Property & Casualty Operations. Specialty provides a broad array of professional, financial and specialty property and casualty products and services through a network of independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters. Commercial includes property and casualty coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and organizations primarily through an independent agency distribution system. Commercial also includes commercial insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations primarily through insurance brokers. International provides management and professional liability coverages as well as a broad range of other property and casualty insurance products and services abroad through a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters, as well as the Lloyd's marketplace.\n\nWe classify our fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, which are both carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. Further information on our fair value measurements is in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe following table details the results of operations for International.\nThe Company purchases corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance covering its U.S. states and territories and Canadian property exposures underwritten in our North American and non-Lloyds European companies. The treaty has a term of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The 2018 treaty provides coverage for the accumulation of losses from catastrophe occurrences above the Company's per occurrence retention of $250 million up to $1.0 billion, with 10% co-participation on the first $650 million above the retention and 20% co-participation on the top $100 million layer. Losses stemming from terrorism events are covered unless they are due to a nuclear, biological or chemical attack. All layers of the treaty provide for one full reinstatement.\nFuture policy benefit reserves for our long term care policies are based on certain assumptions, including morbidity, persistency, inclusive of mortality, discount rates and future premium rate increases. The adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves.\n\nCore income decreased $16 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to a lower underwriting profit and foreign currency exchange losses.\nEstablishing Property & Casualty Reserve Estimates\nto the underlying morbidity assumptions, both frequency and severity, higher than expected rate increases on active rate action programs and favorable changes to the underlying expense assumptions.\nCore loss increased $41 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. Results in both periods were negatively affected by after-tax charges related to the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to adverse reserve development ceded under the 2010 A&EP Loss Portfolio Transfer. The Loss Portfolio Transfer drove $18 million of the year over year change. This is further discussed in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nFavorable net prior year development of $59 million was recorded in 2017 as compared with unfavorable net prior year development of $53 million in 2016. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. This method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.\nFavorable net prior year development of $305 million and $152 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nChanges in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and premium accruals, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year development within this MD&A. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. Net prior year development does not include the effect of related acquisition expenses. Further information on our reserves is provided in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\n2016 Compared with 2015\n\nAnnually, management assesses the adequacy of its long term care future policy benefit reserves by performing a gross premium valuation (GPV) to determine if there is a premium deficiency. Management also uses the GPV process to evaluate the adequacy of the claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for structured settlement obligations. Under the GPV, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. The GPV required reserves are then compared to the recorded reserves. If the GPV required reserves are greater than the existing recorded reserves, the existing assumptions are unlocked and future policy benefit reserves are increased to the greater amount. Any such increase is reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity and business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. Periodically, management engages independent third parties to assess the appropriateness of its best estimate assumptions and the associated GPV required reserves. The most recent assessment by an independent third party was performed in 2017.\nNet written premiums for International increased $60 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 due to higher new business, positive renewal premium change and higher retention. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, net written premiums increased 6.7% in 2017. The increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nInternational\n\nbeen incurred but are not yet reported. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for our long term care policies, our actuaries perform a detailed claim experience study on an annual basis. The study reviews the sufficiency of existing reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. Our recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect management's best estimate after incorporating the results of the most recent study. In addition, claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are also maintained for the structured settlement obligations.\nResults of Operations\nWhat we previously referred to as net operating income (loss) in our public disclosures, we now refer to as core income (loss). The fourth quarter 2017 net deferred tax asset remeasurement was excluded from core income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. Otherwise, there were no changes to the calculation of this measure. We utilize the core income (loss) financial measure to monitor our operations. Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of i) net realized investment gains or losses, ii) income or loss from discontinued operations, iii) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance and iv) deferred tax asset and liability remeasurement as a result of an enacted U.S. Federal tax rate change. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net realized investment gains or losses because net realized investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not considered an indication of trends in insurance operations. Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure. See further discussion regarding how we manage our business and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and other information in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe combined ratio improved 2.1 points in 2017 as compared to 2016. The loss ratio improved 0.8 points primarily due to the favorable period over period effect of net prior year loss reserve development partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $267 million, or 9.4 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $116 million, or 4.1 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 1.9 points. The expense ratio improved 1.6 points in 2017 as compared with 2016, reflecting both our ongoing efforts to improve productivity and the actions undertaken in last year's third and fourth quarters to reduce expenses.\nWe maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). IBNR includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading Insurance Reserves.\u201d Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the Segment Results section of this MD&A and in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\n(2) Ceded reserves relate to claim or policy reserves fully reinsured in connection with a sale or exit from the underlying business.\nThe following table summarizes policyholder reserves for Life & Group.\nIn evaluating the results of our Specialty, Commercial and International segments, we utilize the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio and the combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results.\nThe December 31, 2017 GPV indicated our recorded reserves included a margin of approximately $246 million. A summary of the changes in the estimated reserve margin is presented in the table below:\n2017 Compared with 2016\nIncome Taxes\nOur Property & Casualty Operations field structure consists of 49 underwriting locations across the United States. In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities and also act as call centers to optimize service. Our claim presence consists of six primary locations where we handle multiple claim types and key business functions. Additionally, claim maintains regional offices which are aligned with our underwriting field structure. We also have a presence in Canada, Europe and Singapore consisting of 17 branch operations and access to business placed at Lloyd's of London through Hardy Syndicate 382.\nFor many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers' compensation.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWarranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles and cell phones.\nThe investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related price risk. Additionally, we periodically review the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is included in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included under\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nIn developing claim and claim adjustment expense ( loss\u201d or losses\u201d) reserve estimates, our actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized at a reserve group level. A reserve group can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as aging services, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. Every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, we review actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.\nCurrently, our recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For Commercial, Specialty and International, the difference between our reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment which may adversely affect claim costs and the effects from the economy. For Corporate & Other, the difference between our reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to our long term care policies and are the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium. The determination of these reserves is fundamental to our financial results and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. The assumptions used to determine the active life reserves were unlocked as of December 31, 2015 in connection with the recognition of a premium deficiency. Since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.\nLong Term Care Policies\nOVERVIEW\nThe components of Net realized investment results are presented in the following table.\nUnfavorable net prior year development of $53 million was recorded in 2016 as compared with favorable net prior year development of $30 million in 2015. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is comprised of the following sections:\nThe significant components of Net investment income are presented in the following table. Fixed income securities, as presented, include both fixed maturity and equity securities, which substantially consist of preferred stock.\nFor general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, we estimate that our net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. If the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, we estimate that our net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. Our net reserves for general liability were approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nStochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular reserve group being modeled. For some reserve groups, we use models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. In either case, multiple simulations using varying assumptions are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. The results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.\nOur Life & Group segment includes our run-off long term care business as well as structured settlement obligations not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. Long term care policies provide benefits for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. Generally, policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force and we have the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nCATASTROPHE REINSURANCE\nNet written premiums for Commercial increased $41 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 driven by higher new business within Middle Markets, strong retention and positive renewal premium change. This was partially offset by an unfavorable premium rate adjustment within Small Business that is more fully discussed in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. The increase in net earned premium was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nThe International business is grouped into broad business units which include Energy & Marine, Property, Casualty, Specialty, and Healthcare & Technology. International is managed across three underwriting platforms from Head Offices in London and Toronto.\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the amount of revenues and expenses reported during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nWe maintain both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefit reserves for policyholder benefits for our Life & Group segment. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have\nCore income increased $95 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. Core income for our Property & Casualty Operations declined $23 million primarily driven by higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Net catastrophe losses were $259 million after tax in 2017 as compared to $111 million after tax in 2016. Core loss for our operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations improved $118 million driven by lower adverse prior year A&EP reserve development.\nconsideration of several factors, including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can affect the results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in their adequacy.\nThe following table presents available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in a gross unrealized loss position by ratings distribution.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nFor workers' compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, the most significant factor affecting workers' compensation reserve estimates is claim cost inflation on claim payments. Workers' compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers' compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, we estimate that our net reserves would increase by approximately $350 million. If estimated workers' compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, we estimate that our net reserves would decrease by approximately $350 million. Our net reserves for workers' compensation were approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nFavorable net prior year development of $216 million and $305 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nInsurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts are primarily related to long term care policies and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future premium rate increases. The reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves-Estimates and Uncertainties section below.\nThe key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve groups and accident or policy years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nIn addition, our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses. To mitigate the risks posed by our exposure to A&EP claims and claim adjustment expenses, we completed a transaction with NICO under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO effective January 1, 2010. See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion about the transaction with NICO, its impact on our results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain.\nAs reflected in the Long Term Care Active Life Reserve - Change in estimated reserve margin table on the preceding page, the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate adversely affected the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which we discount our long term care active life reserves. Any future reduction in income tax rates could further adversely affect our GPV discount rates.\nThe three areas for which we believe a significant deviation to our net reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability and surety products; (ii) workers' compensation; and (iii) general liability.\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for International.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, only 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated internally.\nPortfolio Quality\nCore loss improved $88 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, driven by lower adverse net prior year reserve development recorded in 2017 for A&EP under the Loss Portfolio Transfer. This is further discussed in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nNet investment income, after tax, increased $98 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 6.3% in 2016 as compared with 3.0% in the prior year. Income from fixed income securities, after tax, increased $45 million primarily due to an increase in the invested asset base and a charge in 2015 related to a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. See further discussion of the accounting change in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nIf actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for uncollectible reinsurance and insurance receivables, net receivables as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets may not be collected. Therefore, our results of operations or equity could be materially adversely affected.\nA prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving discount rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to our reserves. In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the premium rate increases we request.\n\nManagement & Professional Liability provides management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages.

Surety provides surety and fidelity bonds in all 50 states through a network of independent agencies and brokers.", "item_7_text": "2017 Compared with 2016\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss is a combination of the paid development method and the loss ratio method. This method normally determines expected loss ratios similar to the approach used to estimate the expected loss ratio for the loss ratio method and typically requires analysis of the same factors described above. This method assumes that future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level. The percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid. The use of the pattern from the paid development method typically requires consideration of the same factors listed in the description of the paid development method. The estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year. For long-tail lines, this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation.\nCore income increased $90 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development and net investment income partially offset by higher underwriting expenses and current accident year net loss and loss adjustment expenses.\n\n2017 Compared with 2016\n2016 Compared with 2015\nThe combined ratio increased 4.3 points in 2016 as compared to 2015. The loss ratio increased 3.6 points due to the unfavorable period over period effect of net prior year reserve development and a higher current accident year loss ratio due to higher large losses. Net catastrophe losses were $116 million, or 4.1 points of the loss ratio, for 2016 primarily driven by U.S. weather-related events, as compared to $101 million, or 3.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2015. The expense ratio increased 0.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015, due to higher employee costs and higher IT spending primarily related to a new underwriting platform.\nThe combined ratio increased 3.0 points in 2017 as compared with 2016. The loss ratio increased 3.0 points primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $49 million, or 1.8 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $18 million, or 0.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 1.3 points. The expense ratio in 2017 was consistent with the same period in 2016.\n\n\nA primary objective in the management of the investment portfolio is to optimize return relative to corresponding liabilities and respective liquidity needs. Our views on the current interest rate environment, tax regulations, asset class valuations, specific security issuer and broader industry segment conditions and domestic and global economic conditions, are some of the factors that enter into an investment decision. We also continually monitor exposure to issuers of securities held and broader industry sector exposures and may from time to time adjust such exposures based on our views of a specific issuer or industry sector.\nCommercial works with a network of brokers and independent agents to market a broad range of property and casualty insurance products and services to small, middle-market and large businesses. Property products include standard and excess property, marine and boiler and machinery coverages. Casualty products include standard casualty insurance products such as workers' compensation, general and product liability, commercial auto and umbrella coverages. Most insurance programs are provided on a guaranteed cost basis; however, we also offer specialized loss-sensitive insurance programs and total risk management services relating to claim and information services to the large commercial insurance marketplace. These property and casualty products are offered through our Middle Market, Small Business and Other Commercial insurance groups.\nThe frequency times severity method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident or policy year to produce ultimate loss estimates. Since projections of the ultimate number of claims are often less variable than projections of ultimate loss, this method can provide more reliable results for reserve groups where loss development patterns are inconsistent or too variable to be relied on exclusively. In addition, this method can more directly account for changes in coverage that affect the number and size of claims. However, this method can be difficult to apply to situations where very large claims or a substantial number of unusual claims result in volatile average claim sizes. Projecting the ultimate number of claims may require analysis of several factors, including the rate at which policyholders report claims to us, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes and other factors. Estimating the ultimate average loss may require analysis of the impact of large losses and claim cost trends based on changes in the cost of repairing or replacing\nCore income decreased $58 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, due to a higher underwriting loss partially offset by an increase in net investment income.\nThe Life & Group segment primarily includes the results of our long term care business that is in run-off. Long term care policies were sold on both an individual and group basis. New enrollees in existing groups were accepted through February 1, 2016.\nNet written premiums for Commercial increased $23 million in 2016 as compared with 2015 driven by strong retention in Middle Markets partially offset by a decrease in small business, which included a premium rate adjustment more fully discussed in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. The increase in net earned premium was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nThe accounting estimates discussed below are considered by us to be critical to an understanding of our Consolidated Financial Statements as their application places the most significant demands on our judgment. Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 should be read in conjunction with this section to assist with obtaining an understanding of the underlying accounting policies related to these estimates. Due to the inherent uncertainties involved with these types of judgments, actual results could differ significantly from estimates and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, equity, business, and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings.\nIn 2015, we recognized a $198 million after-tax charge relating to a premium deficiency and claim reserve strengthening. The December 31, 2015 GPV indicated a premium deficiency of $296 million. The indicated premium deficiency necessitated a charge to income that was affected by the write off of the entire long term care deferred acquisition cost of $289 million and an increase to active life reserves of $7 million. In 2015, results of our long term care business reflected variances between actual experience and actuarial assumptions that were locked-in at policy issuance.\nCore income increased $30 million in 2017 as compared with 2016. This increase was driven by favorable morbidity partially offset by unfavorable persistency in the long term care business. Additionally, the release of long term care claim reserves resulting from the annual claims experience study was higher in 2017 as compared with 2016.\nFavorable net prior year development of $64 million and $36 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nNet Investment Income\nCorporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt and the results of certain property and casualty business in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP.\nDuration\nThe combined ratio increased 1.5 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. The loss ratio increased 1.5 points, primarily due to an increase in the current accident year loss ratio driven by a higher level of large losses related to political risk, property and financial institutions, partially offset by higher favorable net prior year development. Net catastrophe losses were $31 million, or 3.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2016 primarily driven by the Fort McMurray wildfires, as compared to $27 million, or 3.3 points of the loss ratio, for 2015. The expense ratio was consistent with 2015.\nThe duration of the total portfolio is aligned with the cash flow characteristics of the underlying liabilities.\nPeriodic Reserve Reviews\nThe following table presents the maturity profile for these available-for-sale fixed maturity securities. Securities not due to mature on a single date are allocated based on weighted average life.\nFor other more complex reserve groups where the above methods may not produce reliable indications, we use additional methods tailored to the characteristics of the specific situation.\nWe expect the overall provisions of the Tax Reform Legislation will have a positive impact on future periods by lowering the effective tax rate and increasing after-tax earnings, primarily due to the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate. The reduction in income taxes will also enhance cash flow.\nNet investment income, after tax, increased $35 million in 2017 as compared with 2016. The increase was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 9.1% in 2017 as compared with 6.3% in the prior year.\nThe following table includes the consolidated results of our operations including our financial measure, Core income. For more detailed components of our business operations and the core income financial measure, see the segment discussions within this MD&A. For further discussion of Net investment income and Net realized investment results, see the Investments section of this MD&A.\nGiven the factors described above, it is not possible to quantify precisely the ultimate exposure represented by claims and related litigation. As a result, we regularly review the adequacy of our reserves and reassess our reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and settled and additional information becomes available in subsequent periods. In reviewing our reserve estimates, we make adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. These reviews have resulted in our identification of information and trends that have caused us to change our reserves in prior periods and could lead to our identification of a need for additional material increases or decreases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves, which could materially affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings positively or negatively. See discussion within Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for additional information about reserve development and the Ratings section of this MD&A for further information regarding our financial strength and corporate debt ratings.\nThe following discusses the results of operations for our business segments.\nThe paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident or policy years with further expected changes in paid losses. Selection of the paid loss pattern may require\nThe following table details the results of operations for Commercial.\nThe level of reserves we maintain represents our best estimate, as of a particular point in time, of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on our assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time. Reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are complex estimates that we derive, generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques, from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events, both internal and external, many of which are highly uncertain. As noted below, we review our reserves for each segment of our business periodically, and any such review could result in the need to increase reserves in amounts which could be material and could adversely affect our results of operations, equity, business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. Further information on reserves is provided in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nValuation of Investments and Impairment of Securities\nThe following table details the results of operations for Specialty.\nLife & Group Policyholder Reserves\nFavorable net prior year development of $312 million and $314 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016 related to our Specialty, Commercial, International and Corporate & Other segments. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nFor many exposures, especially those that can be considered long-tail, a particular accident or policy year may not have a sufficient volume of paid losses to produce a statistically reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In such a case, our actuaries typically assign more weight to the incurred development method than to the paid development method. As claims continue to settle and the volume of paid loss increases, the actuaries may assign additional weight to the paid development method. For most of our products, even the incurred losses for accident or policy years that are early in the claim settlement process will not be of sufficient volume to produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses. In these cases, we may not assign much if any weight to the paid and incurred development methods. We may use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods. For short-tail exposures, the paid and incurred development methods can often be relied on sooner, primarily because our history includes a sufficient number of years to cover the entire period over which paid and incurred losses are expected to change. However, we may also use the loss ratio, Bornhuetter-Ferguson and/or frequency times severity methods for short-tail exposures.\nInsurance Reserves\n\nNet written premiums for International in 2016 were consistent with 2015 and includes favorable period over period premium development of $24 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, net written premiums increased 1.4% in 2016. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, the increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\n2017 Compared with 2016\nCore income was $20 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 driven by a favorable release of claim reserves resulting from the annual claims experience study and higher net investment income due to an increase in the invested asset base. The long term care results were generally in line with expectations, as the impact of favorable morbidity was partially offset by unfavorable persistency.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nCore income increased $309 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. Core results increased $293 million for our operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations primarily as a result of a $198 million after-tax charge in 2015 related to increasing long term care active life and claim reserves. As our active life reserve assumptions were unlocked in 2015, long term care results in 2016 improved significantly. Core income increased $16 million for our Property & Casualty Operations due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development and net investment income, partially offset by an increase in the current accident year loss ratio and higher underwriting expenses. Net catastrophe losses were $111 million after tax in 2016 as compared to $95 million after tax in 2015.\nThe Company also purchases corporate Workers Compensation catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance for the period January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 providing $275 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to natural catastrophes above the Company retention of $25 million. The treaty also provides $475 million of coverage for the accumulation of covered losses related to terrorism events above the Company retention of $25 million. Of this $475 million in Terrorism coverage, $200 million is provided for nuclear, biological chemical and radiation events. One full reinstatement is available for the first $275 million above the retention, regardless of the covered peril. The Company also purchases a targeted facultative facility to address exposure accumulations in specific peak Terrorism zones.\nThe combined ratio increased 5.7 points in 2017 as compared with 2016. The loss ratio increased 6.0 points, primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by lower current accident year large losses. Net catastrophe losses were $64 million, or 7.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $31 million, or 3.9 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 3.0 points. The expense ratio improved 0.3 points in 2017 as compared with 2016 primarily due to the higher net earned premiums.\nCNA Europe provides a diverse range of specialty products as well as commercial insurance products primarily in the marine, property, financial services and healthcare & technology industries throughout Europe on both a domestic and cross border basis.\nThe actuarial assumptions that management believes are subject to the most variability are morbidity, persistency, discount rate and anticipated future premium rate increases. Persistency can be affected by policy lapses, benefit reductions and death. Discount rate is influenced by the investment yield on assets supporting long term care reserves which is subject to interest rate and market volatility and may also be affected by changes to the Internal Revenue Code. There is limited historical company and industry data available to us for long term care morbidity and mortality, as only a portion of the policies written to date are in claims paying status. As a result of this variability, our long term care reserves may be subject to material increases if actual experience develops adversely to our expectations.\n\nAdditionally, exposure exists with respect to the collectibility of amounts due from policyholders related to insurance contracts, including amounts due from insureds under high deductible policies and retrospectively rated policies. An allowance for uncollectible insurance receivables is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from insureds, currently as well as in the future, management's experience and current economic conditions.\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities. Any resulting future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not, and a valuation allowance is established for any portion of a deferred tax asset that management believes will not be realized. The assessment of the need for a valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future earnings, reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies. If actual experience differs from these estimates and assumptions, the recorded deferred tax asset may not be fully realized resulting in an increase to income tax expense in our results of operations. In addition, the ability to record deferred tax assets in the future could be limited, resulting in a higher effective tax rate in that future period.\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis. We continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the Consolidated Financial Statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances.\nCore income decreased $13 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 driven by lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by favorable period over period foreign currency exchange results.\nCorporate & Other\n\n\nReinsurance and Insurance Receivables\nWhat we previously referred to as Net operating income (loss) in our public disclosures, we now refer to as Core income (loss). With this terminology change, we removed Non-Core from the titles of our Life & Group and Corporate & Other segments to avoid confusion.\nNet written premiums for Specialty in 2016 were consistent with 2015 as growth in warranty was offset by a decrease in management and professional liability and healthcare due to underwriting actions undertaken in certain business lines. The trend in net earned premiums was consistent with net written premiums.\nThe table below summarizes the estimated pretax impact on our results of operations from various hypothetical revisions to our active life reserve assumptions. The annual GPV process involves updating all assumptions to the then current best estimate, and historically all significant assumptions have been revised each year. In the Hypothetical Revisions table below, we have assumed that revisions to such assumptions would occur in each policy type, age and duration within each policy group and would occur absent any changes, mitigating or otherwise, in the other assumptions. Although such hypothetical revisions are not currently required or anticipated, we believe they could occur based on past variances in experience and our expectations of the ranges of future experience that could reasonably occur. Any required increase in the recorded reserves resulting from the hypothetical revision in the table below would first reduce the margin in our carried reserves before it would affect results of operations. Any actual adjustment would be dependent on the specific policies affected and, therefore, may differ from the estimates summarized below. The estimated impacts to results of operations in the table below are after consideration of the existing margin.\n(1) To the extent that unrealized gains on fixed income securities supporting long term care products and annuity contracts would result in a premium deficiency if those gains were realized, an increase in Insurance reserves is recorded, net of tax, as a reduction of net unrealized gains through Other comprehensive income (loss) (Shadow Adjustments).\nGroup Workers Compensation Treaty\nSpecialty provides management and professional liability and other coverages through property and casualty products and services using a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters. Specialty includes the following business groups:\nCore income decreased $40 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, primarily due to lower favorable net prior year loss reserve development and higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher net investment income.\nAlthough the Tax Reform Legislation initially reduced our combined statutory surplus in the period of enactment, statutory surplus remains well above minimum regulatory requirements and dividend capacity was not significantly affected.\nProperty and Casualty Claim and Claim Adjustment Expense Reserves\nMost of our business can be characterized as long-tail. For long-tail business, it will generally be several years between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled. Our long-tail exposures include commercial automobile liability, workers' compensation, general liability, medical professional liability, other professional liability and management liability coverages, assumed reinsurance run-off and products liability. Short-tail exposures include property, commercial automobile physical damage, marine, surety and warranty. Specialty, Commercial and International contain both long-tail and short-tail exposures. Corporate & Other contains long-tail exposures.\nNet realized investment gains, after tax, improved $28 million for 2017 as compared with 2016, driven by lower other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) losses recognized in earnings. Additionally, Short term investments and other for the current period included a loss of $27 million after tax related to the redemption of our $350 million senior notes due November 2019. Net realized investment results, after tax, improved $71 million for 2016 as compared with 2015, driven by lower OTTI losses recognized in earnings and higher net realized investment gains on sales of securities.\n(1) Beginning in 2016, new business includes Hardy. New business for Hardy was $151 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nproperty, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors.\nOur investment portfolio is subject to market declines below amortized cost that may be other-than-temporary and therefore result in the recognition of impairment losses in earnings. Factors considered in the determination of whether or not a decline is other-than-temporary include a current intention or need to sell the security or an indication that a credit loss exists. Significant judgment exists regarding the evaluation of the financial condition and expected near-term and long-term prospects of the issuer, the relevant industry conditions and trends and whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Further information on our process for evaluating impairments is in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThese changes to our reserves could materially adversely impact our results of operations and equity. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves - Estimates and Uncertainties section below.\nThe decrease in the margin in 2017 was driven by the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate enacted on December 22, 2017 which reduced the tax equivalent yield on the tax exempt municipal bonds in the investment portfolio supporting the long term care liabilities. A continuation of the low interest rate environment also drove a reduction in the discount rate assumptions. These unfavorable drivers were mostly offset by favorable changes\nThe effective durations of fixed maturity securities, non-redeemable preferred stock and short term investments are presented in the following table. Amounts presented are net of payable and receivable amounts for securities purchased and sold, but not yet settled.\nINVESTMENTS\nDue to the recognition of the premium deficiency and resetting of actuarial assumptions in the fourth quarter of 2015, the 2016 and 2015 results are not comparable. As a result of the reserve assumption unlocking in 2015, the core results of our long term care business in 2016 reflect the variance between actual experience and the expected results contemplated in our best estimate reserves.\nThe effective tax rate for the Life & Group segment is generally a function of the Federal corporate income tax rate and the relative proportion of tax exempt investment income on municipal bonds supporting liabilities to the overall pretax income of the segment. The reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate effective January 1, 2018 will reduce the tax benefit on the segment's pretax losses.\nNet written premiums for Specialty in 2017 were consistent with 2016. New business, renewal premium change and retention also remained at consistent levels. The decrease in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nEffective January 1, 2018, management is changing the segment presentation of our life sciences business and technology and media related errors and omissions (E&O) business within the Specialty and Commercial business segments. Our life sciences business provides product liability and other coverages such as property and workers compensation associated with the life sciences industry. Approximately $100 million of net written premium related to the life sciences business will move from the Specialty business segment to the Commercial business segment. Our technology and media related E&O business provides network security and privacy, media and E&O coverage primarily for technology risks. Approximately $70 million of net written premium related to this business will move from the Commercial business segment to the Specialty business segment. We believe the new management responsibility for these businesses better aligns with line of business underwriting expertise and the manner in which the products are sold. The new classifications will be presented in the Company's financial statements beginning with the period ending March 31, 2018, and prior periods presented will conform to the new presentation.\n\n2017 Compared with 2016\nIndex to this MD&A\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018,\u201d previously known as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d was signed into law (Tax Reform Legislation). The Tax Reform Legislation provides for a permanent reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, among other provisions. As a result, we recorded a one-time non-cash increase to Income tax expense of $83 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value and net unrealized gains (losses) of our fixed maturity securities by rating distribution.\nOur recorded reserves are management's best estimate. In order to provide an indication of the variability associated with our net reserves, the following discussion provides a sensitivity analysis that shows the approximate estimated impact of variations in significant factors affecting our reserve estimates for particular types of business. These significant factors are the ones that we believe could most likely materially affect the reserves. This discussion covers the major types of business for which we believe a material deviation to our reserves is reasonably possible. There can be no assurance that actual experience will be consistent with the current assumptions or with the variation indicated by the discussion. In addition, there can be no assurance that other factors and assumptions will not have a material impact on our reserves.\nFavorable net prior year development of $314 million and $218 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015 related to our Specialty, Commercial, International and Corporate & Other segments. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nCommercial\n2017 Compared with 2016\n\nProfessional liability, management liability and surety products include professional liability coverages provided to various professional firms, including architects, real estate agents, small and mid-sized accounting firms, law firms and other professional firms. They also include directors and officers (D&O), employment practices, fiduciary, fidelity and surety coverages, as well as insurance products serving the healthcare delivery system. The most significant factor affecting reserve estimates for these liability coverages is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, legal fees, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Underwriting and claim handling decisions such as the classes of business written and individual claim settlement decisions can also affect claim severity. If the estimated claim severity increases by 9%, we estimate that net reserves would increase by approximately $450 million. If the estimated claim severity decreases by 3%, we estimate that net reserves would decrease by approximately $150 million. Our net reserves for these products were approximately $5.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the Corporate & Other segment, including intersegment eliminations.\n\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for Corporate & Other.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with Item 1A Risk Factors, Item 6 Selected Financial Data and Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K.\nGroup North American Property Treaty\nThe reserve analyses performed by our actuaries result in point estimates. Each quarter, the results of the detailed reserve reviews are summarized and discussed with senior management to determine the best estimate of reserves. Senior management considers many factors in making this decision. Our recorded reserves reflect our best estimate as of a particular point in time based upon known facts and circumstances, consideration of the factors cited above and our judgment. The carried reserve differs from the actuarial point estimate as discussed further below.\nAs discussed in the Risk Factors discussion within Item 1A, there is a risk that our recorded reserves are insufficient to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claims and claim adjustment expenses. Unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues are difficult to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions.\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for Commercial.\nThe incurred development method is similar to the paid development method, but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses. Since the method uses more data (case reserves in addition to paid losses) than the paid development method, the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns. However, selection of the incurred loss pattern typically requires analysis of all of the same factors described above. In addition, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place, and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available.\nRESERVES - ESTIMATES AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nNet Realized Investment Gains (Losses)\nThe combined ratio decreased 3.7 points in 2016 as compared with 2015. The loss ratio decreased 4.6 points due to higher favorable net prior year reserve development partially offset by a higher current accident year loss ratio. Net catastrophe losses were $18 million, or 0.6 points of the loss ratio, for 2016 as compared to $13 million, or 0.4 points of the loss ratio, for 2015. The expense ratio increased 0.9 points in 2016 as compared with 2015, due to higher employee costs and higher IT spending primarily related to new underwriting platforms.\nFavorable net prior year development of $27 million and $64 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nA further consideration in the management of the investment portfolio is the characteristics of the corresponding liabilities and the ability to align the duration of the portfolio to those liabilities and to meet future liquidity needs, minimize interest rate risk and maintain a level of income sufficient to support the underlying insurance liabilities. For portfolios where future liability cash flows are determinable and typically long term in nature, we segregate investments for asset/liability management purposes. The segregated investments support the long term care and structured settlement liabilities in the Life & Group segment.\nExposure exists with respect to the collectibility of ceded property and casualty and life reinsurance to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities we have ceded under reinsurance agreements. An allowance for uncollectible reinsurance is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers, reinsurer solvency, industry experience and current economic conditions. Further information on our reinsurance receivables is in Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\n\nSpecialty\nThe annual long term care claim experience study resulted in a release of $42 million from claim reserves driven by favorable frequency and severity relative to expectations.\n\n\nCore income increased $30 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, due to the favorable period over period effect of net prior year loss reserve development and improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses.\nInternational provides property and casualty and specialty coverages on a global basis through its operations in Canada, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Singapore, as well as through its presence at Lloyd's of London.\n\n\nHardy operates through Lloyd's Syndicate 382 underwriting primarily short-tail exposures in energy, marine, property, casualty and specialty lines with risks located in many countries around the world. The capacity of and results from the syndicate are 100% attributable to CNA.\nLife & Group\nFurther information on our realized gains and losses, including our OTTI losses and derivative gains (losses), as well as our impairment decision process, is set forth in Notes A and B to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for Specialty.\nThe loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums. The expense ratio is the percentage of insurance underwriting and acquisition expenses, including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs, to net earned premiums. The dividend ratio is the ratio of policyholders' dividends incurred to net earned premiums. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss, expense and dividend ratios. In addition we also utilize renewal premium change, rate, retention and new business in evaluating operating trends. Renewal premium change represents the estimated change in average premium on policies that renew, including rate and exposure changes. Rate represents the average change in price on policies that renew excluding exposure change. Retention represents the percentage of premium dollars renewed in comparison to the expiring premium dollars from policies available to renew. Renewal premium change, rate and retention presented for the prior year are updated to reflect subsequent activity on policies written in the period. New business represents premiums from policies written with new customers and additional policies written with existing customers.\nOur operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations are managed and reported in two segments: Life & Group and Corporate & Other. Life & Group primarily includes the results of our long term care business that is in run-off. Corporate & Other primarily includes certain corporate expenses, including interest on corporate debt, and the results of certain property and casualty businesses in run-off, including CNA Re and A&EP. Intersegment eliminations are also included in this segment.\nThe Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using incurred loss is similar to the Bornhuetter-Ferguson method using paid loss except that it uses case incurred losses. The use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns. However, the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place, and the method typically requires analysis of the same factors that need to be reviewed for the loss ratio and incurred development methods.\nOur property and casualty commercial insurance operations are managed and reported in three business segments: Specialty, Commercial and International, which we refer to collectively as Property & Casualty Operations. Specialty provides a broad array of professional, financial and specialty property and casualty products and services through a network of independent agents, brokers and managing general underwriters. Commercial includes property and casualty coverages sold to small businesses and middle market entities and organizations primarily through an independent agency distribution system. Commercial also includes commercial insurance and risk management products sold to large corporations primarily through insurance brokers. International provides management and professional liability coverages as well as a broad range of other property and casualty insurance products and services abroad through a network of brokers, independent agencies and managing general underwriters, as well as the Lloyd's marketplace.\n\nWe classify our fixed maturity securities and equity securities as either available-for-sale or trading, which are both carried at fair value on the balance sheet. Fair value represents the price that would be received in a sale of an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date, the determination of which requires us to make a significant number of assumptions and judgments. Securities with the greatest level of subjectivity around valuation are those that rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value and that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. These unobservable inputs are based on assumptions consistent with what we believe other market participants would use to price such securities. Further information on our fair value measurements is in Note C to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe following table details the results of operations for International.\nThe Company purchases corporate catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty reinsurance covering its U.S. states and territories and Canadian property exposures underwritten in our North American and non-Lloyds European companies. The treaty has a term of January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018. The 2018 treaty provides coverage for the accumulation of losses from catastrophe occurrences above the Company's per occurrence retention of $250 million up to $1.0 billion, with 10% co-participation on the first $650 million above the retention and 20% co-participation on the top $100 million layer. Losses stemming from terrorism events are covered unless they are due to a nuclear, biological or chemical attack. All layers of the treaty provide for one full reinstatement.\nFuture policy benefit reserves for our long term care policies are based on certain assumptions, including morbidity, persistency, inclusive of mortality, discount rates and future premium rate increases. The adequacy of the reserves is contingent upon actual experience and our future expectations related to these key assumptions. If actual or expected future experience differs from these assumptions, the reserves may not be adequate, requiring us to add to reserves.\n\nCore income decreased $16 million in 2016 as compared with 2015, primarily due to a lower underwriting profit and foreign currency exchange losses.\nEstablishing Property & Casualty Reserve Estimates\nto the underlying morbidity assumptions, both frequency and severity, higher than expected rate increases on active rate action programs and favorable changes to the underlying expense assumptions.\nCore loss increased $41 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. Results in both periods were negatively affected by after-tax charges related to the application of retroactive reinsurance accounting to adverse reserve development ceded under the 2010 A&EP Loss Portfolio Transfer. The Loss Portfolio Transfer drove $18 million of the year over year change. This is further discussed in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nFavorable net prior year development of $59 million was recorded in 2017 as compared with unfavorable net prior year development of $53 million in 2016. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe loss ratio method multiplies earned premiums by an expected loss ratio to produce ultimate loss estimates for each accident or policy year. This method may be useful for immature accident or policy periods or if loss development patterns are inconsistent, losses emerge very slowly or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses. The selection of the expected loss ratio typically requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident or policy years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends, frequency trends, rate changes, underwriting changes and other applicable factors.\nFavorable net prior year development of $305 million and $152 million was recorded in 2016 and 2015. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nChanges in estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and premium accruals, net of reinsurance, for prior years are defined as net prior year development within this MD&A. These changes can be favorable or unfavorable. Net prior year development does not include the effect of related acquisition expenses. Further information on our reserves is provided in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\n2016 Compared with 2015\n\nAnnually, management assesses the adequacy of its long term care future policy benefit reserves by performing a gross premium valuation (GPV) to determine if there is a premium deficiency. Management also uses the GPV process to evaluate the adequacy of the claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for structured settlement obligations. Under the GPV, management estimates required reserves using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the assessment without provisions for adverse deviation. The GPV required reserves are then compared to the recorded reserves. If the GPV required reserves are greater than the existing recorded reserves, the existing assumptions are unlocked and future policy benefit reserves are increased to the greater amount. Any such increase is reflected in our results of operations in the period in which the need for such adjustment is determined, and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, equity and business and insurer financial strength and corporate debt ratings. Periodically, management engages independent third parties to assess the appropriateness of its best estimate assumptions and the associated GPV required reserves. The most recent assessment by an independent third party was performed in 2017.\nNet written premiums for International increased $60 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 due to higher new business, positive renewal premium change and higher retention. Excluding the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and premium development, net written premiums increased 6.7% in 2017. The increase in net earned premiums was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nInternational\n\nbeen incurred but are not yet reported. In developing the claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates for our long term care policies, our actuaries perform a detailed claim experience study on an annual basis. The study reviews the sufficiency of existing reserves for policyholders currently on claim and includes an evaluation of expected benefit utilization and claim duration. Our recorded claim and claim adjustment expense reserves reflect management's best estimate after incorporating the results of the most recent study. In addition, claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are also maintained for the structured settlement obligations.\nResults of Operations\nWhat we previously referred to as net operating income (loss) in our public disclosures, we now refer to as core income (loss). The fourth quarter 2017 net deferred tax asset remeasurement was excluded from core income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017. Otherwise, there were no changes to the calculation of this measure. We utilize the core income (loss) financial measure to monitor our operations. Core income (loss) is calculated by excluding from net income (loss) the after-tax effects of i) net realized investment gains or losses, ii) income or loss from discontinued operations, iii) any cumulative effects of changes in accounting guidance and iv) deferred tax asset and liability remeasurement as a result of an enacted U.S. Federal tax rate change. The calculation of core income (loss) excludes net realized investment gains or losses because net realized investment gains or losses are generally driven by economic factors that are not necessarily consistent with key drivers of underwriting performance, and are therefore not considered an indication of trends in insurance operations. Management monitors core income (loss) for each business segment to assess segment performance. Presentation of consolidated core income (loss) is deemed to be a non-GAAP financial measure. See further discussion regarding how we manage our business and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP measures and other information in Note O to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nThe combined ratio improved 2.1 points in 2017 as compared to 2016. The loss ratio improved 0.8 points primarily due to the favorable period over period effect of net prior year loss reserve development partially offset by higher net catastrophe losses. Net catastrophe losses were $267 million, or 9.4 points of the loss ratio, for 2017, as compared to $116 million, or 4.1 points of the loss ratio, for 2016. The loss ratio excluding catastrophes and development improved 1.9 points. The expense ratio improved 1.6 points in 2017 as compared with 2016, reflecting both our ongoing efforts to improve productivity and the actions undertaken in last year's third and fourth quarters to reduce expenses.\nWe maintain loss reserves to cover our estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses, including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process, for claims that have been reported but not yet settled (case reserves) and claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNR). IBNR includes a provision for development on known cases as well as a provision for late reported incurred claims. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves are reflected as liabilities and are included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets under the heading Insurance Reserves.\u201d Adjustments to prior year reserve estimates, if necessary, are reflected in results of operations in the period that the need for such adjustments is determined. The carried case and IBNR reserves as of each balance sheet date are provided in the Segment Results section of this MD&A and in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\n(2) Ceded reserves relate to claim or policy reserves fully reinsured in connection with a sale or exit from the underlying business.\nThe following table summarizes policyholder reserves for Life & Group.\nIn evaluating the results of our Specialty, Commercial and International segments, we utilize the loss ratio, the expense ratio, the dividend ratio and the combined ratio. These ratios are calculated using GAAP financial results.\nThe December 31, 2017 GPV indicated our recorded reserves included a margin of approximately $246 million. A summary of the changes in the estimated reserve margin is presented in the table below:\n2017 Compared with 2016\nIncome Taxes\nOur Property & Casualty Operations field structure consists of 49 underwriting locations across the United States. In addition, there are five centralized processing operations which handle policy processing, billing and collection activities and also act as call centers to optimize service. Our claim presence consists of six primary locations where we handle multiple claim types and key business functions. Additionally, claim maintains regional offices which are aligned with our underwriting field structure. We also have a presence in Canada, Europe and Singapore consisting of 17 branch operations and access to business placed at Lloyd's of London through Hardy Syndicate 382.\nFor many reserve groups, paid loss data for recent periods may be too immature or erratic for accurate predictions. This situation often exists for long-tail exposures. In addition, changes in the factors described above may result in inconsistent payment patterns. Finally, estimating the paid loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available in the data analyzed often involves considerable uncertainty for long-tail products such as workers' compensation.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nWarranty and Alternative Risks provides extended service contracts and related products that provide protection from the financial burden associated with mechanical breakdown and other related losses, primarily for vehicles and cell phones.\nThe investment portfolio is periodically analyzed for changes in duration and related price risk. Additionally, we periodically review the sensitivity of the portfolio to the level of foreign exchange rates and other factors that contribute to market price changes. A summary of these risks and specific analysis on changes is included in the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk included under\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nIn developing claim and claim adjustment expense ( loss\u201d or losses\u201d) reserve estimates, our actuaries perform detailed reserve analyses that are staggered throughout the year. The data is organized at a reserve group level. A reserve group can be a line of business covering a subset of insureds such as commercial automobile liability for small or middle market customers, it can encompass several lines of business provided to a specific set of customers such as aging services, or it can be a particular type of claim such as construction defect. Every reserve group is reviewed at least once during the year. The analyses generally review losses gross of ceded reinsurance and apply the ceded reinsurance terms to the gross estimates to establish estimates net of reinsurance. In addition to the detailed analyses, we review actual loss emergence for all products each quarter.\nCurrently, our recorded reserves are modestly higher than the actuarial point estimate. For Commercial, Specialty and International, the difference between our reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by uncertainty with respect to immature accident years, claim cost inflation, changes in claims handling, changes to the tort environment which may adversely affect claim costs and the effects from the economy. For Corporate & Other, the difference between our reserves and the actuarial point estimate is primarily driven by the potential tail volatility of run-off exposures.\nFuture policy benefit reserves represent the active life reserves related to our long term care policies and are the present value of expected future benefit payments and expenses less expected future premium. The determination of these reserves is fundamental to our financial results and requires management to make estimates and assumptions about expected investment and policyholder experience over the life of the contract. The assumptions used to determine the active life reserves were unlocked as of December 31, 2015 in connection with the recognition of a premium deficiency. Since many of these contracts may be in force for several decades, these assumptions are subject to significant estimation risk.\nLong Term Care Policies\nOVERVIEW\nThe components of Net realized investment results are presented in the following table.\nUnfavorable net prior year development of $53 million was recorded in 2016 as compared with favorable net prior year development of $30 million in 2015. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is comprised of the following sections:\nThe significant components of Net investment income are presented in the following table. Fixed income securities, as presented, include both fixed maturity and equity securities, which substantially consist of preferred stock.\nFor general liability, the most significant factor affecting reserve estimates is claim severity. Claim severity is driven by changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislation and other factors. If the estimated claim severity for general liability increases by 6%, we estimate that our net reserves would increase by approximately $200 million. If the estimated claim severity for general liability decreases by 3%, we estimate that our net reserves would decrease by approximately $100 million. Our net reserves for general liability were approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nStochastic modeling produces a range of possible outcomes based on varying assumptions related to the particular reserve group being modeled. For some reserve groups, we use models which rely on historical development patterns at an aggregate level, while other reserve groups are modeled using individual claim variability assumptions supplied by the claims department. In either case, multiple simulations using varying assumptions are run and the results are analyzed to produce a range of potential outcomes. The results will typically include a mean and percentiles of the possible reserve distribution which aid in the selection of a point estimate.\nOur Life & Group segment includes our run-off long term care business as well as structured settlement obligations not funded by annuities related to certain property and casualty claimants. Long term care policies provide benefits for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and home health care subject to various daily and lifetime caps. Generally, policyholders must continue to make periodic premium payments to keep the policy in force and we have the ability to increase policy premiums, subject to state regulatory approval.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nCATASTROPHE REINSURANCE\nNet written premiums for Commercial increased $41 million in 2017 as compared with 2016 driven by higher new business within Middle Markets, strong retention and positive renewal premium change. This was partially offset by an unfavorable premium rate adjustment within Small Business that is more fully discussed in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. The increase in net earned premium was consistent with the trend in net written premiums.\nThe International business is grouped into broad business units which include Energy & Marine, Property, Casualty, Specialty, and Healthcare & Technology. International is managed across three underwriting platforms from Head Offices in London and Toronto.\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements and the amount of revenues and expenses reported during the period. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\nWe maintain both claim and claim adjustment expense reserves as well as future policy benefit reserves for policyholder benefits for our Life & Group segment. Claim and claim adjustment expense reserves consist of estimated reserves for long term care policyholders that are currently receiving benefits, including claims that have\nCore income increased $95 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. Core income for our Property & Casualty Operations declined $23 million primarily driven by higher net catastrophe losses partially offset by improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results. Net catastrophe losses were $259 million after tax in 2017 as compared to $111 million after tax in 2016. Core loss for our operations outside of Property & Casualty Operations improved $118 million driven by lower adverse prior year A&EP reserve development.\nconsideration of several factors, including the impact of inflation on claims costs, the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims, the impact of judicial decisions, the impact of underwriting changes, the impact of large claim payments and other factors. Claim cost inflation itself may require evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property, changes in the cost of medical care, changes in the cost of wage replacement, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. Because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate, changes in any of these factors can affect the results. Since the method does not rely on case reserves, it is not directly influenced by changes in their adequacy.\nThe following table presents available-for-sale fixed maturity securities in a gross unrealized loss position by ratings distribution.\n2016 Compared with 2015\nFor workers' compensation, since many years will pass from the time the business is written until all claim payments have been made, the most significant factor affecting workers' compensation reserve estimates is claim cost inflation on claim payments. Workers' compensation claim cost inflation is driven by the cost of medical care, the cost of wage replacement, expected claimant lifetimes, judicial decisions, legislative changes and other factors. If estimated workers' compensation claim cost inflation increases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, we estimate that our net reserves would increase by approximately $350 million. If estimated workers' compensation claim cost inflation decreases by 100 basis points for the entire period over which claim payments will be made, we estimate that our net reserves would decrease by approximately $350 million. Our net reserves for workers' compensation were approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2017.\nFavorable net prior year development of $216 million and $305 million was recorded in 2017 and 2016. Further information on net prior year development is in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nInsurance reserves are established for both short and long-duration insurance contracts. Short-duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty insurance policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss, including amounts for known and unknown claims. Long-duration contracts are primarily related to long term care policies and are estimated using actuarial estimates about morbidity and persistency as well as assumptions about expected investment returns and future premium rate increases. The reserve for unearned premiums on property and casualty contracts represents the portion of premiums written related to the unexpired terms of coverage. The reserving process is discussed in further detail in the Reserves-Estimates and Uncertainties section below.\nThe key assumptions fundamental to the reserving process are often different for various reserve groups and accident or policy years. Some of these assumptions are explicit assumptions that are required of a particular method, but most of the assumptions are implicit and cannot be precisely quantified. An example of an explicit assumption is the pattern employed in the paid development method. However, the assumed pattern is itself based on several implicit assumptions such as the impact of inflation on medical costs and the rate at which claim professionals close claims. As a result, the effect on reserve estimates of a particular change in assumptions typically cannot be specifically quantified, and changes in these assumptions cannot be tracked over time.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nIn addition, our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have actual and potential exposures related to A&EP claims, which could result in material losses. To mitigate the risks posed by our exposure to A&EP claims and claim adjustment expenses, we completed a transaction with NICO under which substantially all of our legacy A&EP liabilities were ceded to NICO effective January 1, 2010. See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8 for further discussion about the transaction with NICO, its impact on our results of operations and the deferred retroactive reinsurance gain.\nAs reflected in the Long Term Care Active Life Reserve - Change in estimated reserve margin table on the preceding page, the reduction in the Federal corporate income tax rate adversely affected the value of the tax benefit received on tax exempt municipal investments and thus the rate at which we discount our long term care active life reserves. Any future reduction in income tax rates could further adversely affect our GPV discount rates.\nThe three areas for which we believe a significant deviation to our net reserves is reasonably possible are (i) professional liability, management liability and surety products; (ii) workers' compensation; and (iii) general liability.\nThe following table summarizes the gross and net carried reserves for International.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, only 2% of our fixed maturity portfolio was rated internally.\nPortfolio Quality\nCore loss improved $88 million in 2017 as compared with 2016, driven by lower adverse net prior year reserve development recorded in 2017 for A&EP under the Loss Portfolio Transfer. This is further discussed in Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nNet investment income, after tax, increased $98 million in 2016 as compared with 2015. The increase was driven by limited partnership investments, which returned 6.3% in 2016 as compared with 3.0% in the prior year. Income from fixed income securities, after tax, increased $45 million primarily due to an increase in the invested asset base and a charge in 2015 related to a change in estimate effected by a change in accounting principle. See further discussion of the accounting change in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements included under Item 8.\nIf actual experience differs from the estimates made by management in determining the allowances for uncollectible reinsurance and insurance receivables, net receivables as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets may not be collected. Therefore, our results of operations or equity could be materially adversely affected.\nA prolonged period during which interest rates remain at levels lower than those anticipated in our reserving discount rate assumption could result in shortfalls in investment income on assets supporting our obligations under long term care policies, which may also require an increase to our reserves. In addition, we may not receive regulatory approval for the premium rate increases we request.\n\nManagement & Professional Liability provides management and professional liability insurance and risk management services and other specialized property and casualty coverages.

Property & Casualty segment offset by lower adverse prior year A&E reserve development in the Corporate & Other segment. \n\n- Net catastrophe losses were $259 million after tax in 2017 versus $111 million after tax in 2016.\n\n- Favorable net prior year loss reserve development was recorded in 2017 for the Specialty, Commercial, International and Corporate & Other segments. \n\n- Net investment income after tax increased $35 million in 2017 driven by returns from limited partnership investments.\n\n- The Life & Group segment includes run-off long term care business. Core income increased $30 million in 2017 due to favorable morbidity and higher premium rates, partially offset by unfavorable persistency.\n\n- The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a one-time $83 million non-cash charge for remeasurement of net deferred tax assets. The new tax law is expected to have a positive impact on future earnings.\n\n- Total reserves are management's best estimate and include a modest margin above the actuarial point estimate. The margin declined in 2017 primarily due to the reduced corporate tax rate.\n\n- The MD&A provides analysis of results and trends for the Specialty, Commercial, International, Life & Group, and Corporate & Other business segments. Key metrics like loss ratios, expense ratios, written premiums and prior year development are discussed for each segment."}
