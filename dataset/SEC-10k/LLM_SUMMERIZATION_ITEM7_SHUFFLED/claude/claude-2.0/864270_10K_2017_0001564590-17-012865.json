Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOverview\nOur primary focus, in collaboration with AHM and HCI, is to provide support for the sale of Honda and Acura products and maintain customer and dealer satisfaction and loyalty. To deliver this support effectively, we seek to maintain competitive cost of funds, efficient operations, and effective risk and compliance management. The primary factors influencing our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition include the volume of Honda and Acura sales and the portion of those sales that we finance, our cost of funds, competition from other financial institutions, consumer credit defaults, and used motor vehicle prices.\nA substantial portion of our consumer financing business is acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI. The volume of incentive financing programs and the allocation of those programs between retail loans and leases may vary from fiscal period to fiscal period depending upon the respective marketing strategies of AHM and HCI. AHM and HCI's marketing strategies are based in part on their business planning, in which we do not participate. Therefore, we cannot predict the level of incentive financing programs AHM and HCI may sponsor in the future. Our consumer financing acquisition volumes are substantially dependent on the extent to which incentive financing programs are offered. Increases in incentive financing programs generally increase our financing penetration rates, which typically results in increased financing acquisition volumes for us. The amount of subsidy payments we receive from AHM and HCI is dependent on the terms of the incentive financing programs and the interest rate environment. Subsidy payments are received upon acquisition and recognized in revenue throughout the life of the loan or lease; therefore, a significant change in the level of incentive financing programs in a fiscal period often may not be reflected in our results of operations for that period. The amount of subsidy income we recognize in a fiscal period is dependent on the cumulative level of subsidized contracts outstanding that were acquired through incentive financing programs.\nWe seek to maintain high quality consumer and dealer account portfolios, which we support with strong underwriting standards, risk-based pricing, and effective collection capabilities. Our cost of funds is facilitated by the diversity of our funding sources, and effective interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. We manage expenses to increase our profitability, including adjusting staffing needs based upon our business volumes and centralizing support functions. Additionally, we use risk and compliance management practices to optimize credit and residual value risk levels and maintain compliance with our pricing, underwriting and servicing policies at the United States, Canadian, state and provincial levels.\nIn our business operations, we incur costs related to funding, credit loss, residual value loss, and general and administrative expenses, among other expenses.\nWe analyze our operations in two business segments defined by geography: the United States and Canada. We measure the performance of our United States and Canada segments on a pre-tax basis before the effect of valuation adjustments on derivative instruments and revaluations of foreign currency denominated debt. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 15-Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables and the related discussion are presented based on our geographically segmented consolidated financial statements.\nThis report contains translations of certain foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars at the rates specified below solely for your convenience. These translations should not be construed as representations that the foreign currency amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts or that they could be converted into U.S. dollars at the rates indicated. U.S. dollar equivalents for C$\u201d (Canadian dollar), \u20ac\u201d (Euro) and \u00a3\u201d (Sterling) amounts are calculated based on the exchange rates on March 31, 2017 of 1.3318, 0.9360 and 0.7978, respectively, per U.S. dollar.\nReferences in this report to our fiscal year 2017\u201d and fiscal year 2016\u201d refer to our fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, respectively.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents our income before income taxes:\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (U.S. dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States segment\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total income before income taxes\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nOur consolidated income before income taxes was $1,190 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to $1,458 million in fiscal year 2016. This decline of $268 million, or 18%, was primarily due to a loss on derivative instruments of $315 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $101 million during fiscal year 2016, an increase in interest expense of $136 million, an increase in provision for credit loss of $60 million, a decline in revenue from direct financing leases of $38 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of $31 million and an increase in early termination loss on operating leases of $27 million, partially offset by a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $171 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $60 million during fiscal year 2016, an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $175 million and an increase in revenue from dealer loans of $25 million.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015\nOur consolidated income before income taxes was $1,458 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $1,552 million in fiscal year 2015. This decrease of $94 million, or 6%, was primarily due to a loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt of $60 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to a gain of $353 million during fiscal year 2015, a decrease in retail loan revenues of $81 million, a decrease in direct financing lease revenues of $63 million, an increase in provision for credit losses of $36 million, an increase in interest expense of $12 million, an increase in early termination loss on operating leases of $9 million, an increase in loss on lease residual values of $9 million, and an incurrence of an impairment loss on operating leases of $8 million in fiscal year 2016, which did not occur in fiscal year 2015, partially offset by a gain on derivative instruments of $101 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to a loss of $326 million during fiscal year 2015, an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $98 million and an increase in gain on disposition of lease vehicles of $14 million.\nSegment Results-Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nResults of operations for the United States segment and the Canada segment are summarized below:\nTable 64: <table>

million, or 1%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding retail loans, which was partially offset by higher yields on such loans. Revenue from retail loans in the Canada segment increased by $14 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher average outstanding retail loans.\nOperating lease revenue increased by $524 million, or 10%, in the United States segment and by $286 million, or 57%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases in revenue were due to higher average outstanding operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments.\nDirect financing lease revenue, which is generated only in Canada, declined by $38 million, or 53%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 due to the continued decline in outstanding direct financing lease assets.\nRevenue from dealer loans in the United States segment increased by $24 million, or 22%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans and higher yields on such loans. Revenue from dealer loans in the Canada segment increased by $1 million, or 8%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans.\nConsolidated subsidy income from AHM and HCI sponsored incentive programs increased by $156 million, or 14%, to $1,232 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $1,076 million during fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding incentive leases.\nDepreciation on operating leases\nDepreciation on operating leases increased by $391 million, or 10%, in the United States segment and by $244 million, or 60%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases in depreciation were primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments. The increases in depreciation were also due in part to declines in estimated used vehicle prices in both the United States and Canada segments.\nOperating lease revenue, net of depreciation, increased by $133 million, or 13%, in the United States segment and by $42 million, or 46%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases were primarily attributable to the growth in our operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense in the United States segment increased by $120 million, or 23%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher average interest rates. Interest expense in the Canada segment increased by $16 million, or 22%, due to an increase in average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for more information.\nGain/loss on disposition of lease vehicles\nThe gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the United States segment declined by $22 million, or 48%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The lower gain was due to a decline in auction prices during the period and the impact of the delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles that were affected by the recall announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the Canada segment increased by $14 million, or 280%. The increase in gains was primarily the result of more favorable vehicle return rates and disposition proceeds than the assumptions that were reflected in their estimated residual values. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\nProvision for credit losses\nThe provision for credit losses in the United States segment increased by $65 million, or 49%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages due in part to the increase in the volume of retail loans with 72-month terms. The provision for credit losses in the Canada segment declined by $5 million, or 31%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to lower net charge-offs. See -Financial Condition-Credit Risk\u201d below for more information.\nEarly termination loss on operating leases\nEarly termination losses on operating leases in the United States segment increased by $26 million, or 63%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets and an increase in the mix of leases with lower credit grades. During fiscal year 2016, we reduced our estimate of early termination losses which lowered the amount of losses we recognized during the period. Early termination losses on operating leases in the Canada segment increased by $1 million, or 20%, primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets. See -Financial Condition-Credit Risk\u201d below for more information.\nImpairment loss on operating leases\nNo impairment losses due to declines in estimated residual values were recognized during the fiscal year 2017. Impairment losses on operating leases of $6 million were recognized in the United States segment and $2 million in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2016 due to the expected delay in disposition of lease vehicles affected by the recall in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\nLoss on lease residual values\nLoss on lease residual values in the Canada segment increased by $2 million, or 15%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to higher expected loss severities. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\nGain/loss on derivative instruments\nIn the United States segment, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments of $324 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $116 million during fiscal year 2016. The loss in fiscal year 2017 was attributable to losses on pay float interest rate swaps of $235 million and cross currency swaps of $228 million, which were partially offset by gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps of $139 million. The losses on pay float interest rate swaps and gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps during fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in interest rates. The losses on cross currency swaps during fiscal year 2017 were primarily attributable to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Sterling during the period. In the Canada segment, we recognized a gain on derivative instruments of $9 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $15 million during fiscal year 2016. The gains during fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in Canadian interest rates. See -Derivatives\u201d below for more information.\nGain/loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt\nIn the United States segment, we recognized a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $171 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $60 million during fiscal year 2016. The gain during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Sterling during the period.\nIncome tax expense\nOur consolidated effective tax rate was 36.7% for fiscal year 2017 and 37.6% for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a change in the estimated state tax rate and the effect of state tax law changes.

The majority of our credit risk is in consumer financing and to a lesser extent in dealer financing. Credit risk of our portfolio of consumer finance receivables can be affected by general economic conditions. Adverse changes such as a rise in unemployment rates can increase the likelihood of defaults. Declines in used vehicle prices can reduce the amount of recoveries on repossessed collateral. We manage our exposure to credit risk in retail loans and direct financing leases by monitoring and adjusting our underwriting standards, which affect the level of credit risk that we assume, pricing contracts for expected losses, and focusing collection efforts to minimize losses.\nWe are also exposed to credit risk on our portfolio of operating lease assets. We expect a portion of our operating leases to terminate prior to their scheduled maturities when lessees default on their contractual obligations. Losses are generally realized upon the disposition of the repossessed operating lease vehicles. The factors affecting credit risk on our operating leases and our management of the risk are similar to that of our retail loans and direct financing leases.\nCredit risk on dealer loans is affected primarily by the financial strength of the dealers within the portfolio, the value of collateral securing the financings, and economic and market factors that could affect the creditworthiness of dealers. We manage our exposure to credit risk in dealer financing by performing comprehensive reviews of dealers prior to establishing financing arrangements and monitoring the payment performance and creditworthiness of these dealers on an ongoing basis. In the event of default by a dealer, we seek all available legal remedies pursuant to related dealer agreements, guarantees, security interests on collateral, or liens on dealership assets. Additionally, we have entered into agreements with AHM and HCI that provide for their repurchase, at the outstanding financed amount, of new, unused, undamaged and unregistered vehicle or equipment that have been repossessed from dealers who defaulted under the terms of its wholesale flooring agreement.\nAn allowance for credit losses is maintained for management's estimate of probable losses incurred on finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses for estimated probable losses incurred on past due

The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages. Default frequencies and loss severities have increased in recent vintages, due in part to the increase in the volume of retail loans with 72-month terms. We recognized early termination losses on operating lease assets of $67 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $41 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets and an increase in the mix of leases with lower credit grades.\nIn the Canada segment, the provision for credit losses on our finance receivables was $10 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $15 million during fiscal year 2016. The decline in the provision for credit losses was due in part to a decline in net charge-offs. Early termination losses on operating lease assets was $6 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $5 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets.\nLease Residual Value Risk\nContractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or for a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealers are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of the lease term.\nWe assess our estimates for end of lease term market values of leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and expected loss severities. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends, and market information on new and used vehicles. Our leasing volumes and leasing volumes across the automotive industry have increased significantly in recent years. As a result, the supply of off-lease vehicles will continue to increase over the next several years which could negatively impact used vehicle prices. For operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the lease and recognized as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed. Additional information regarding lease residual values is provided in the discussion of -Critical Accounting Policies-Determination of Lease Residual Values\u201d below.\nWe also review our investment in operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment conditions are met, impairment losses are measured by the amount carrying values exceed their fair values.\nCertain Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 based on a determination of a safety related defect in driver's airbag inflators. AHM and HCI instructed their authorized dealers to cease the sale of affected new and used vehicles until the recall repairs were completed. Tests for recoverability were performed on operating leases affected by this recall, which reflected the anticipated delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles. For the operating lease assets that did not pass the test for recoverability, we recognized $6 million of impairment losses in the United States segment and $2 million of impairment losses in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2016. The loss on lease residual values of direct financing leases recognized in the Canada segment attributable to the expected delay in disposition of lease vehicles affected by this recall was approximately $5 million. During the second half of fiscal year 2017, we began repairing and selling the affected returned lease vehicles. Only a limited number of affected returned lease vehicles were still held for disposition as of March 31, 2017, which we expect to sell during fiscal year 2018. We did not recognize impairment losses due to declines in estimated residual values during fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2015.\nThe following table summarizes our number of lease terminations and the method of disposition:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (Units (1) in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Termination units:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales at outstanding contractual balances (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales through auctions and dealer direct programs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total termination units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Termination units:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales at outstanding contractual balances (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales through auctions and dealer direct programs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total termination units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Termination units:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales at outstanding contractual balances (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales through auctions and dealer direct programs (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total termination units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> A unit represents one terminated lease by their method of disposition during the period shown.

Our cash flows are generally impacted by cash requirements related to the volume of finance receivable and operating lease acquisitions and various operating and funding costs incurred, which are largely funded through payments received on our assets and our funding sources outlined below. As noted, the levels of incentive financing sponsored by AHM and HCI can impact our financial results and liquidity from period to period. Increases or decreases in incentive financing programs typically increase or decrease our financing penetration rates, respectively, which result in increased or decreased acquisition volumes and increased or decreased liquidity needs, respectively. At acquisition, we receive the subsidy payments, which reduce the cost of consumer loan and lease contracts acquired, and we recognize such payments as revenue over the term of the loan or lease.\nIn an effort to minimize liquidity risk and interest rate risk and the resulting negative effects on our margins, results of operations and cash flows, our funding strategy incorporates investor diversification and the utilization of multiple funding sources including commercial paper, medium term notes, bank loans and asset-backed securities. AHFC has reduced the use of related party debt as a funding source. As of March 31, 2017 AHFC had no outstanding notes issued to AHM. We incorporate a funding strategy that takes into consideration factors such as the interest rate environment, domestic and foreign capital market conditions, maturity profiles, and economic conditions. We believe that our funding sources, combined with cash provided by operating and investing activities, will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our debt service and working capital requirements over the next twelve months.\nSummary of Outstanding Debt\nThe table below presents a summary of our outstanding debt by various funding sources:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

$7.0 billion and in Canada of C$2.0 billion ($1.5 billion). Interest rates on the commercial paper are fixed at the time of issuance. During fiscal year 2017, consolidated commercial paper month-end outstanding principal balances ranged from $4.5 billion to $6.6 billion and the outstanding daily balance averaged $5.8 billion.\nRelated Party Debt\nAHFC issues fixed rate notes to AHM to help fund AHFC's general corporate operations. As of March 31, 2017, AHFC had no outstanding notes issued to AHM. HCFI issues fixed rate notes to HCI to help fund HCFI's general corporate operations. Interest rates are based on prevailing rates of debt with comparable terms. Generally, the term of these notes is less than 120 days. During fiscal year 2017, consolidated related party debt month-end principal balances ranged from $1.2 billion to $2.3 billion and the outstanding daily balance averaged $1.9 billion.\nBank Loans\nDuring fiscal year 2017, AHFC entered into four floating rate term loan agreements for an aggregate of $1.6 billion and HCFI entered into two floating rate term loan agreements for an aggregate of C$375 million ($282 million). As of March 31, 2017, we had bank loans denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars with floating interest rates, in principal amounts ranging from $38 million to $600 million. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all bank loans outstanding ranged from 77 days to approximately 5.5 years. The weighted average remaining maturities on all bank loans was 3.2 years as of March 31, 2017.\nOur bank loans contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales, and a financial covenant that requires us to maintain positive consolidated tangible net worth. In addition to other customary events of default, the bank loans include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. All of these covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the bank loans. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in our bank loans.\nMedium Term Note (MTN) Programs\nPrivate MTN Program\nAHFC no longer issues MTNs under the Rule 144A Private MTN Program. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of Private MTNs outstanding ranged from 164 days to approximately 4.5 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of Private MTNs was 2.0 years as of March 31, 2017. Interest rates on outstanding Private MTNs were fixed. Private MTNs were issued pursuant to the terms of an issuing and paying agency agreement which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of defaults. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Private MTNs.\nPublic MTN Program\nAHFC is a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules and issues Public MTNs pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC. In August 2016, AHFC filed a registration statement with the SEC under which it may issue from time to time up to $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Public MTNs. During fiscal year 2016, AHFC began issuing foreign currency denominated notes into international markets under this program. The aggregate principal amount of MTNs offered under this program may be increased from time to time.\nThe Public MTNs may have original maturities of 9 months or more from the date of issue, may be interest bearing with either fixed or floating interest rates, or may be discounted notes. During fiscal year 2017, AHFC issued $7.7 billion aggregate principal amount of MTNs denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and Sterling, with an original maturity ranging from 1.0 year to 10.0 years, bearing interest at fixed and floating rates. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all Public MTNs outstanding ranged from 35 days to approximately 9.4 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Public MTNs was 2.7 years as of March 31, 2017.\nThe Public MTNs are issued pursuant to an indenture, which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions and restrictions on AHFC's ability to merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of its assets or the assets of its subsidiaries, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants under the indenture.\nEuro MTN Programme\nThe Euro MTN Programme was retired in August 2014. Notes under this program that are currently listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange will remain listed through their maturity. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of Euro MTNs outstanding under this program ranged from 356 days to approximately 5.9 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Euro MTNs was 2.2 years as of March 31, 2017. Interest rates on outstanding Euro MTNs are fixed or floating. Euro MTNs were issued pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Euro MTNs.\nThe table below presents a summary of outstanding debt issued under our MTN Programs by currency:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (U.S. dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. dollar\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Euro\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sterling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Japanese yen\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Debt\nHCFI issues privately placed Canadian dollar denominated notes, with either fixed or floating interest rates. During fiscal year 2017, HCFI entered into four private placement trades for an aggregate of C$1.2 billion ($901 million). As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all of HCFI's Canadian notes outstanding ranged from 7 days to approximately 5.3 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of these notes was 2.5 years as of March 31, 2017.\nThe notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture, which requires HCFI to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that HCFI was in compliance with all covenants contained in the privately placed notes.\nSecured Debt\nAsset-Backed Securities\nWe enter into securitization transactions for funding purposes. Securitization transactions involve transferring pools of retail loans to trusts. The trusts are special-purpose entities that we establish to accommodate securitization structures. Securitization trusts have the limited purpose of acquiring assets, issuing asset-backed securities, and making payments on the securities. Assets transferred to securitization trusts are considered to be legally isolated from us and the claims of our creditors. We continue to service the retail loans transferred to the trusts. Investors in the notes issued by a trust only have recourse to the assets of such trust and do not have recourse to AHFC, HCFI, or our other subsidiaries or to other trusts.\nOur securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancements to investors in the notes issued by the trusts. Credit enhancements can include the following:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Subordinated certificates-which are securities issued by the trusts that are retained by us and are subordinated in priority of payment to the notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Overcollateralization-which occurs when the principal balance of securitized assets exceed the balance of securities issued by the trust.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Excess interest-which allows excess interest collections to be used to cover losses on defaulted loans.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Reserve funds-which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to cover shortfalls in payments of interest and principal required to be paid on the notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Yield supplement accounts-which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to supplement interest payments on notes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe risk retention regulations in Regulation RR of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), require the sponsor to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized receivables, either directly or through one or more majority-owned affiliates. Standard risk retention options allow the sponsor to retain either an eligible vertical interest, an eligible horizontal residual interest, or a combination of both. AHFC has satisfied this obligation by retaining an eligible vertical interest of an amount equal to at least 5% of the principal amount of each class of note and certificate issued for the securitization transaction that was subject to this rule but may choose to use other structures in the future.\nWe are required to consolidate the securitization trusts in our financial statements, which results in the securitizations being accounted for as on-balance sheet secured financings. The securitized receivables remain on our consolidated balance sheet along with the notes issued by the trusts. The notes are secured solely by the assets of the applicable trust and not by any of our other assets or those of other trusts. The assets of a trust are the only source of funds for repayment on the notes of such trust.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we issued notes through asset-backed securitizations totaling $5.7 billion, which were secured by consumer finance receivables with an initial principal balance of $6.3 billion.\nCredit Agreements\nSyndicated Bank Credit Facilities\nAHFC maintains a $3.5 billion 364-day credit agreement, which expires on March 2, 2018, a $2.1 billion three-year credit agreement, which expires on March 3, 2020, and a $1.4 billion five-year credit agreement, which expires on March 3, 2022. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under the AHFC credit agreements. AHFC intends to renew or replace these credit agreements prior to or on their respective expiration dates.\nHCFI maintains a C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) credit agreement, as amended, which provides that HCFI may borrow up to C$800 million ($601 million) on a one-year and up to C$800 million ($601 million) on a five-year revolving basis. The one-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2018 and the five-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2022. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under the HCFI credit agreement. HCFI intends to renew or replace the credit agreement prior to or on the expiration date of each respective tranche.\nThe credit agreements contain customary conditions to borrowing and customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens and limitations on mergers, consolidations and asset sales. The credit agreements also require AHFC and HCFI, respectively, to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth as defined in their respective credit agreements. The credit agreements, in addition to other customary events of default, include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. In addition, the AHFC and HCFI credit agreements contain provisions for default if HMC's obligations under the HMC-AHFC Keep Well Agreement or the HMC-HCFI Keep Well Agreement, as applicable, become invalid, voidable, or unenforceable. All of these conditions, covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the credit agreements. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in the respective credit agreements.\nOther Credit Agreements\nAHFC maintains other committed lines of credit that allow the Company access to an additional $1.0 billion in unsecured funding with multiple banks. The credit agreements contain customary covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales and a requirement for AHFC to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under these agreements. These agreements expire in September 2017. AHFC intends to renew these credit agreements prior to or on their expiration dates.\nKeep Well Agreements\nHMC has entered into separate Keep Well Agreements with AHFC and HCFI. For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 1. Business-Relationships with HMC and Affiliates-HMC and AHFC Keep Well Agreement\u201d and Part I, Item 1. Business-Relationships with HMC and Affiliates-HMC and HCFI Keep Well Agreement.\u201d\nAs consideration for HMC's obligations under the Keep Well Agreements, we have agreed to pay HMC a quarterly fee based on the amount of outstanding Debt pursuant to support compensation agreements, dated October 1, 2005. We incurred expenses of $20 million, $18 million and $17 million during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, pursuant to these support compensation agreements.\nIndebtedness of Consolidated Subsidiaries\nAs of March 31, 2017, AHFC and its consolidated subsidiaries had $57.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities, including current liabilities, of which $15.2 billion consisted of indebtedness and liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries. None of AHFC's consolidated subsidiaries had any outstanding preferred equity.\nDerivatives\nWe utilize derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The types of derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, basis swaps, and cross currency swaps. Interest rate and basis swap agreements are used to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations of our floating rate debt relative to our fixed rate finance receivables and operating lease assets. Cross currency swap agreements are used to manage currency and interest rate risk exposure on foreign currency denominated debt. The derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.\nAll derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities, and carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Since we do not elect to apply hedge accounting, the impact to earnings resulting from these valuation adjustments as reported under GAAP is not representative of our results of operations as evaluated by management. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of realized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated debt, are included in the measure of net revenues when we evaluate segment performance.

Refer to Note 9-Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these commitments.\nOur contractual obligations on derivative instruments are also excluded from the table above because our future cash obligations under these contracts are inherently uncertain. We recognize all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The amounts recognized as fair value do not represent the amounts that will be ultimately paid or received upon settlement under these contracts. Refer to Note 5-Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative instruments.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRefer to Note 1(o) -Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Note 1(p)-Recently Issued Accounting Standards of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that require the application of our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often requiring us to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods, or for which the use of different estimates that could have reasonably been used in the current period would have had a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in additional changes to the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the determination of lease residual values.\nCredit Losses\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for management's estimate of probable losses incurred on our finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses on past due operating lease rental payments. These estimates are evaluated by management, at minimum, on a quarterly basis.\nConsumer finance receivables are collectively evaluated for impairment. Delinquencies and losses are monitored on an ongoing basis and this historical experience provides the primary basis for estimating the allowance. Management utilizes various methodologies when estimating the allowance for credit losses including models which incorporate vintage loss and delinquency migration analysis. These models take into consideration attributes of the portfolio, including loan-to-value ratios, internal and external credit scores, collateral types, and loan terms. Market and economic factors such as used vehicle prices, unemployment rates, and consumer debt service burdens are also incorporated into these models. Estimated losses on operating leases expected to terminate early due to lessee defaults are also determined collectively, consistent with the methodologies used for consumer finance receivables.\nDealer finance receivables are individually evaluated for impairment when specifically identified as impaired. Dealer finance receivables are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the loan. Our determination of whether dealer loans are impaired is based on evaluations of dealership payment history, financial condition, and cash flows, and their ability to perform under the terms of the loans. Dealer loans that have not been specifically identified as impaired are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nRefer to Note 1(e)-Finance Receivables, Note 1(f)-Investment in Operating Leases and Note 1(i)-Vehicles Held for Disposition of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding charge-offs or write-downs of contractual balances of retail and dealer finance receivables and operating leases.\nOur allowance for credit losses and early termination losses on operating leases requires significant judgment about inherently uncertain factors. The estimates are based on management's evaluation of many factors, including our historical credit loss experience, the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends, and economic conditions. The estimates are based on information available as of each reporting date. Actual losses may differ from the original estimates due to actual results varying from those assumed in our estimates.\nSensitivity Analysis\nIf we had experienced a 10% increase in net charge-offs of finance receivables during fiscal year 2017, our provision for credit losses would have increased by approximately $28 million during the period. Similarly, if we had experienced a 10% increase in realized losses on the disposition of repossessed operating lease vehicles during the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017, we would have recognized an additional $13 million in early termination losses in our consolidated statement of income during the period.\nDetermination of Lease Residual Values\nContractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealer are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of lease term. We assess our estimates for end of term market values of the leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and expected loss severities. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends and market information on new and used vehicles. Our leasing volumes and leasing volumes across the automotive industry have increased significantly in recent years. As a result, the supply of off-lease vehicles will continue to increase over the next several years which could negatively impact used vehicle prices.\nFor operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of each lease and recognized as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed.\nSensitivity Analysis\nIf future estimated auction values for all outstanding operating leases as of March 31, 2017 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $66 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. If future return rates for all operating leases were to increase by one percentage point from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $11 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. This sensitivity analysis may be asymmetric and is specific to the conditions in effect as of March 31, 2017. Additionally, any declines in auction values are likely to have a negative effect on return rates which could affect the severity of the impact on our results of operations.", "item_7_truncated": "Credit losses are an expected cost of extending credit. The majority of our credit risk is in consumer financing and to a lesser extent in dealer financing. Credit risk of our portfolio of consumer finance receivables can be affected by general economic conditions. Adverse changes such as a rise in unemployment rates can increase the likelihood of defaults. Declines in used vehicle prices can reduce the amount of recoveries on repossessed collateral. We manage our exposure to credit risk in retail loans and direct financing leases by monitoring and adjusting our underwriting standards, which affect the level of credit risk that we assume, pricing contracts for expected losses, and focusing collection efforts to minimize losses.\nRevenues\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New auto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Motorcycle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New auto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Motorcycle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New auto\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Motorcycle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had commercial paper programs in the United States of $7.0 billion and in Canada of C$2.0 billion ($1.5 billion).

</tr>\n</table>\nOther Debt\nIf we had experienced a 10% increase in net charge-offs of finance receivables during fiscal year 2017, our provision for credit losses would have increased by approximately $28 million during the period. Similarly, if we had experienced a 10% increase in realized losses on the disposition of repossessed operating lease vehicles during the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017, we would have recognized an additional $13 million in early termination losses in our consolidated statement of income during the period.\nIn the United States segment, we recognized a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $171 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $60 million during fiscal year 2016. The gain during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Sterling during the period.\nEarly termination loss on operating leases\nWe are also exposed to credit risk on our portfolio of operating lease assets. We expect a portion of our operating leases to terminate prior to their scheduled maturities when lessees default on their contractual obligations. Losses are generally realized upon the disposition of the repossessed operating lease vehicles. The factors affecting credit risk on our operating leases and our management of the risk are similar to that of our retail loans and direct financing leases.\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>

Our cash flows are generally impacted by cash requirements related to the volume of finance receivable and operating lease acquisitions and various operating and funding costs incurred, which are largely funded through payments received on our assets and our funding sources outlined below. As noted, the levels of incentive financing sponsored by AHM and HCI can impact our financial results and liquidity from period to period. Increases or decreases in incentive financing programs typically increase or decrease our financing penetration rates, respectively, which result in increased or decreased acquisition volumes and increased or decreased liquidity needs, respectively. At acquisition, we receive the subsidy payments, which reduce the cost of consumer loan and lease contracts acquired, and we recognize such payments as revenue over the term of the loan or lease.\nRelated Party Debt\nThe credit agreements contain customary conditions to borrowing and customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens and limitations on mergers, consolidations and asset sales. The credit agreements also require AHFC and HCFI, respectively, to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth as defined in their respective credit agreements. The credit agreements, in addition to other customary events of default, include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. In addition, the AHFC and HCFI credit agreements contain provisions for default if HMC's obligations under the HMC-AHFC Keep Well Agreement or the HMC-HCFI Keep Well Agreement, as applicable, become invalid, voidable, or unenforceable. All of these conditions, covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the credit agreements. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in the respective credit agreements.\nConsumer Financing Acquisition Volumes\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> United States Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Motorcycle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Motorcycle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Automobile\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Motorcycle\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA substantial portion of our consumer financing business is acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI. The volume of incentive financing programs and the allocation of those programs between retail loans and leases may vary from fiscal period to fiscal period depending upon the respective marketing strategies of AHM and HCI. AHM and HCI's marketing strategies are based in part on their business planning, in which we do not participate. Therefore, we cannot predict the level of incentive financing programs AHM and HCI may sponsor in the future. Our consumer financing acquisition volumes are substantially dependent on the extent to which incentive financing programs are offered. Increases in incentive financing programs generally increase our financing penetration rates, which typically results in increased financing acquisition volumes for us. The amount of subsidy payments we receive from AHM and HCI is dependent on the terms of the incentive financing programs and the interest rate environment. Subsidy payments are received upon acquisition and recognized in revenue throughout the life of the loan or lease; therefore, a significant change in the level of incentive financing programs in a fiscal period often may not be reflected in our results of operations for that period. The amount of subsidy income we recognize in a fiscal period is dependent on the cumulative level of subsidized contracts outstanding that were acquired through incentive financing programs.\nDetermination of Lease Residual Values\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Years ended March 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

</tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated effective tax rate was 36.7% for fiscal year 2017 and 37.6% for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a change in the estimated state tax rate and the effect of state tax law changes. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7-Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Overcollateralization-which occurs when the principal balance of securitized assets exceed the balance of securities issued by the trust. \nThe Public MTNs are issued pursuant to an indenture, which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions and restrictions on AHFC's ability to merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of its assets or the assets of its subsidiaries, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants under the indenture.\nLoss on lease residual values in the Canada segment increased by $2 million, or 15%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to higher expected loss severities. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\n (2) Includes vehicles purchased by lessees or dealers for the contractual residual value at lease maturity or the outstanding contractual balance if purchased prior to lease maturity. \nThe following table summarizes the percentage of AHM unit sales in the United States and/or HCI unit sales in Canada, as applicable, that we financed through wholesale flooring loans with dealerships:\nWe enter into securitization transactions for funding purposes. Securitization transactions involve transferring pools of retail loans to trusts. The trusts are special-purpose entities that we establish to accommodate securitization structures. Securitization trusts have the limited purpose of acquiring assets, issuing asset-backed securities, and making payments on the securities. Assets transferred to securitization trusts are considered to be legally isolated from us and the claims of our creditors. We continue to service the retail loans transferred to the trusts. Investors in the notes issued by a trust only have recourse to the assets of such trust and do not have recourse to AHFC, HCFI, or our other subsidiaries or to other trusts.\nIn our business operations, we incur costs related to funding, credit loss, residual value loss, and general and administrative expenses, among other expenses.\nEuro MTN Programme\nWe assess our estimates for end of lease term market values of leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and expected loss severities. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends, and market information on new and used vehicles. Our leasing volumes and leasing volumes across the automotive industry have increased significantly in recent years. As a result, the supply of off-lease vehicles will continue to increase over the next several years which could negatively impact used vehicle prices. For operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the lease and recognized as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed. Additional information regarding lease residual values is provided in the discussion of -Critical Accounting Policies-Determination of Lease Residual Values\u201d below.\nConsumer Financing Penetration Rates\nRevenue from dealer loans in the United States segment increased by $24 million, or 22%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans and higher yields on such loans. Revenue from dealer loans in the Canada segment increased by $1 million, or 8%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans.\n (1) Ending and average receivable balances exclude the allowance for credit losses, write-down of lease residual values, unearned subvention income related to our incentive financing programs and deferred origination costs. Average receivable balances are calculated based on the average of each month's ending receivables balance for that fiscal year. \nDerivatives\nAHFC is a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules and issues Public MTNs pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC. In August 2016, AHFC filed a registration statement with the SEC under which it may issue from time to time up to $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Public MTNs. During fiscal year 2016, AHFC began issuing foreign currency denominated notes into international markets under this program. The aggregate principal amount of MTNs offered under this program may be increased from time to time.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we issued notes through asset-backed securitizations totaling $5.7 billion, which were secured by consumer finance receivables with an initial principal balance of $6.3 billion.\nAdditional information regarding credit losses is provided in the discussion of -Critical Accounting Policies-Credit Losses\u201d below.\nSecured Debt\nIn an effort to minimize liquidity risk and interest rate risk and the resulting negative effects on our margins, results of operations and cash flows, our funding strategy incorporates investor diversification and the utilization of multiple funding sources including commercial paper, medium term notes, bank loans and asset-backed securities. AHFC has reduced the use of related party debt as a funding source. As of March 31, 2017 AHFC had no outstanding notes issued to AHM. We incorporate a funding strategy that takes into consideration factors such as the interest rate environment, domestic and foreign capital market conditions, maturity profiles, and economic conditions. We believe that our funding sources, combined with cash provided by operating and investing activities, will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our debt service and working capital requirements over the next twelve months.\n (1) A unit represents one terminated lease by their method of disposition during the period shown. Unit counts do not include leases that were terminated due to lessee defaults. \nPublic MTN Program\nFinancial Condition\n \u2022 Reserve funds-which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to cover shortfalls in payments of interest and principal required to be paid on the notes. \nWe seek to maintain high quality consumer and dealer account portfolios, which we support with strong underwriting standards, risk-based pricing, and effective collection capabilities. Our cost of funds is facilitated by the diversity of our funding sources, and effective interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. We manage expenses to increase our profitability, including adjusting staffing needs based upon our business volumes and centralizing support functions. Additionally, we use risk and compliance management practices to optimize credit and residual value risk levels and maintain compliance with our pricing, underwriting and servicing policies at the United States, Canadian, state and provincial levels.\n (2) Securitized retail loans represent the portion of total retail loans that have been sold in securitization transactions but continue to be recognized on our balance sheet. Securitized retail loans are included in the amounts for total retail loans. \nWholesale Flooring Financing Percentage of Sales\nCredit Agreements\n \u2022 Subordinated certificates-which are securities issued by the trusts that are retained by us and are subordinated in priority of payment to the notes. \nRevenue from retail loans in the United States segment declined by $11 million, or 1%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding retail loans, which was partially offset by higher yields on such loans. Revenue from retail loans in the Canada segment increased by $14 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher average outstanding retail loans.\nOur consolidated income before income taxes was $1,190 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to $1,458 million in fiscal year 2016. This decline of $268 million, or 18%, was primarily due to a loss on derivative instruments of $315 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $101 million during fiscal year 2016, an increase in interest expense of $136 million, an increase in provision for credit loss of $60 million, a decline in revenue from direct financing leases of $38 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of $31 million and an increase in early termination loss on operating leases of $27 million, partially offset by a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $171 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $60 million during fiscal year 2016, an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $175 million and an increase in revenue from dealer loans of $25 million.\nLease Residual Value Risk\nGain/loss on derivative instruments\nAsset-Backed Securities\nOur allowance for credit losses and early termination losses on operating leases requires significant judgment about inherently uncertain factors. The estimates are based on management's evaluation of many factors, including our historical credit loss experience, the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends, and economic conditions. The estimates are based on information available as of each reporting date. Actual losses may differ from the original estimates due to actual results varying from those assumed in our estimates.\nContractual Obligations\nAHFC maintains other committed lines of credit that allow the Company access to an additional $1.0 billion in unsecured funding with multiple banks. The credit agreements contain customary covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales and a requirement for AHFC to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under these agreements. These agreements expire in September 2017. AHFC intends to renew these credit agreements prior to or on their expiration dates.\nWe utilize derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The types of derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, basis swaps, and cross currency swaps. Interest rate and basis swap agreements are used to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations of our floating rate debt relative to our fixed rate finance receivables and operating lease assets. Cross currency swap agreements are used to manage currency and interest rate risk exposure on foreign currency denominated debt. The derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.\nIf future estimated auction values for all outstanding operating leases as of March 31, 2017 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $66 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. If future return rates for all operating leases were to increase by one percentage point from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $11 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. This sensitivity analysis may be asymmetric and is specific to the conditions in effect as of March 31, 2017. Additionally, any declines in auction values are likely to have a negative effect on return rates which could affect the severity of the impact on our results of operations.\nOur bank loans contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales, and a financial covenant that requires us to maintain positive consolidated tangible net worth. In addition to other customary events of default, the bank loans include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. All of these covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the bank loans. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in our bank loans.\nSegment Results-Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nIncome tax expense\nSyndicated Bank Credit Facilities\nResults of Operations\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (2) For the purposes of determining whether a contract is delinquent, payment is generally considered to have been made, in the case of (i) dealer finance receivables, upon receipt of 100% of the payment when due and (ii) consumer finance receivables, upon receipt of 90% of the sum of the current monthly payment plus any overdue monthly payments. Delinquent amounts presented are the aggregated principal balances of delinquent finance receivables. \n (3) Includes vehicles sold through online auctions and market based pricing options under our dealer direct programs or through physical auctions. \nConsolidated subsidy income from AHM and HCI sponsored incentive programs increased by $156 million, or 14%, to $1,232 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $1,076 million during fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding incentive leases.\n\nInterest expense in the United States segment increased by $120 million, or 23%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher average interest rates. Interest expense in the Canada segment increased by $16 million, or 22%, due to an increase in average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for more information.\nAll derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities, and carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Since we do not elect to apply hedge accounting, the impact to earnings resulting from these valuation adjustments as reported under GAAP is not representative of our results of operations as evaluated by management. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of realized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated debt, are included in the measure of net revenues when we evaluate segment performance. Refer to Note 15-Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about segment information and Note 5-Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative instruments.\nAHFC issues fixed rate notes to AHM to help fund AHFC's general corporate operations. As of March 31, 2017, AHFC had no outstanding notes issued to AHM. HCFI issues fixed rate notes to HCI to help fund HCFI's general corporate operations. Interest rates are based on prevailing rates of debt with comparable terms. Generally, the term of these notes is less than 120 days. During fiscal year 2017, consolidated related party debt month-end principal balances ranged from $1.2 billion to $2.3 billion and the outstanding daily balance averaged $1.9 billion.\nLoss on lease residual values\n (1) A unit represents one automobile, motorcycle, power equipment, or marine engine, as applicable, financed through a wholesale flooring loan that was outstanding as of the date shown. \nWe are not a party to off-balance sheet arrangements.\nSensitivity Analysis\nCredit Losses\nWholesale Flooring Financing Penetration Rates\nThe table below presents a summary of outstanding debt issued under our MTN Programs by currency:\nThe following table summarizes the number of retail loans and leases we acquired and the number of such loans and leases acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI:\nDepreciation on operating leases\n (1) A unit represents one retail loan or lease contract, as noted, that was outstanding as of the date shown. \nOur primary focus, in collaboration with AHM and HCI, is to provide support for the sale of Honda and Acura products and maintain customer and dealer satisfaction and loyalty. To deliver this support effectively, we seek to maintain competitive cost of funds, efficient operations, and effective risk and compliance management. The primary factors influencing our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition include the volume of Honda and Acura sales and the portion of those sales that we finance, our cost of funds, competition from other financial institutions, consumer credit defaults, and used motor vehicle prices.\nOperating lease revenue increased by $524 million, or 10%, in the United States segment and by $286 million, or 57%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases in revenue were due to higher average outstanding operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments.\nRefer to Note 1(o) -Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Note 1(p)-Recently Issued Accounting Standards of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAn allowance for credit losses is maintained for management's estimate of probable losses incurred on finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses for estimated probable losses incurred on past due operating lease rental payments.\nDirect financing lease revenue, which is generated only in Canada, declined by $38 million, or 53%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 due to the continued decline in outstanding direct financing lease assets.\nContractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealer are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of lease term. We assess our estimates for end of term market values of the leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and expected loss severities. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends and market information on new and used vehicles. Our leasing volumes and leasing volumes across the automotive industry have increased significantly in recent years. As a result, the supply of off-lease vehicles will continue to increase over the next several years which could negatively impact used vehicle prices.\nThe gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the United States segment declined by $22 million, or 48%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The lower gain was due to a decline in auction prices during the period and the impact of the delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles that were affected by the recall announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the Canada segment increased by $14 million, or 280%. The increase in gains was primarily the result of more favorable vehicle return rates and disposition proceeds than the assumptions that were reflected in their estimated residual values. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\nThe following table presents our income before income taxes:\nConsumer Financing Asset Balances\nProvision for credit losses\n\nIn the United States segment, the provision for credit losses on our finance receivables was $177 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $116 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages. Default frequencies and loss severities have increased in recent vintages, due in part to the increase in the volume of retail loans with 72-month terms. We recognized early termination losses on operating lease assets of $67 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $41 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets and an increase in the mix of leases with lower credit grades.\n\nOur contractual obligations on derivative instruments are also excluded from the table above because our future cash obligations under these contracts are inherently uncertain. We recognize all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The amounts recognized as fair value do not represent the amounts that will be ultimately paid or received upon settlement under these contracts. Refer to Note 5-Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative instruments.\nHCFI issues privately placed Canadian dollar denominated notes, with either fixed or floating interest rates. During fiscal year 2017, HCFI entered into four private placement trades for an aggregate of C$1.2 billion ($901 million). As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all of HCFI's Canadian notes outstanding ranged from 7 days to approximately 5.3 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of these notes was 2.5 years as of March 31, 2017.\nIndebtedness of Consolidated Subsidiaries\nRefer to Note 1(e)-Finance Receivables, Note 1(f)-Investment in Operating Leases and Note 1(i)-Vehicles Held for Disposition of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding charge-offs or write-downs of contractual balances of retail and dealer finance receivables and operating leases.\n \u2022 Excess interest-which allows excess interest collections to be used to cover losses on defaulted loans. \nDealer finance receivables are individually evaluated for impairment when specifically identified as impaired. Dealer finance receivables are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the loan. Our determination of whether dealer loans are impaired is based on evaluations of dealership payment history, financial condition, and cash flows, and their ability to perform under the terms of the loans. Dealer loans that have not been specifically identified as impaired are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nThis report contains translations of certain foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars at the rates specified below solely for your convenience. These translations should not be construed as representations that the foreign currency amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts or that they could be converted into U.S. dollars at the rates indicated. U.S. dollar equivalents for C$\u201d (Canadian dollar), \u20ac\u201d (Euro) and \u00a3\u201d (Sterling) amounts are calculated based on the exchange rates on March 31, 2017 of 1.3318, 0.9360 and 0.7978, respectively, per U.S. dollar.\nNew Accounting Standards\nResults of operations for the United States segment and the Canada segment are summarized below:\nWe also review our investment in operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment conditions are met, impairment losses are measured by the amount carrying values exceed their fair values.\nCredit Risk\nPrivate MTN Program\n\nOur securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancements to investors in the notes issued by the trusts. Credit enhancements can include the following:\nThe following table summarizes our number of lease terminations and the method of disposition:\nThe obligations in the above table do not include certain lending commitments to dealers since the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. Refer to Note 9-Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these commitments.\nAs consideration for HMC's obligations under the Keep Well Agreements, we have agreed to pay HMC a quarterly fee based on the amount of outstanding Debt pursuant to support compensation agreements, dated October 1, 2005. We incurred expenses of $20 million, $18 million and $17 million during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, pursuant to these support compensation agreements.\nOverview\nHCFI maintains a C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) credit agreement, as amended, which provides that HCFI may borrow up to C$800 million ($601 million) on a one-year and up to C$800 million ($601 million) on a five-year revolving basis. The one-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2018 and the five-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2022. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under the HCFI credit agreement. HCFI intends to renew or replace the credit agreement prior to or on the expiration date of each respective tranche.\nCredit risk on dealer loans is affected primarily by the financial strength of the dealers within the portfolio, the value of collateral securing the financings, and economic and market factors that could affect the creditworthiness of dealers. We manage our exposure to credit risk in dealer financing by performing comprehensive reviews of dealers prior to establishing financing arrangements and monitoring the payment performance and creditworthiness of these dealers on an ongoing basis. In the event of default by a dealer, we seek all available legal remedies pursuant to related dealer agreements, guarantees, security interests on collateral, or liens on dealership assets. Additionally, we have entered into agreements with AHM and HCI that provide for their repurchase, at the outstanding financed amount, of new, unused, undamaged and unregistered vehicle or equipment that have been repossessed from dealers who defaulted under the terms of its wholesale flooring agreement.\nBank Loans\nThe provision for credit losses in the United States segment increased by $65 million, or 49%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages due in part to the increase in the volume of retail loans with 72-month terms. The provision for credit losses in the Canada segment declined by $5 million, or 31%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to lower net charge-offs. See -Financial Condition-Credit Risk\u201d below for more information.\n\nMedium Term Note (MTN) Programs\nDepreciation on operating leases increased by $391 million, or 10%, in the United States segment and by $244 million, or 60%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases in depreciation were primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments. The increases in depreciation were also due in part to declines in estimated used vehicle prices in both the United States and Canada segments.\nContractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or for a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealers are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of the lease term.\n\nImpairment loss on operating leases\nCertain Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 based on a determination of a safety related defect in driver's airbag inflators. AHM and HCI instructed their authorized dealers to cease the sale of affected new and used vehicles until the recall repairs were completed. Tests for recoverability were performed on operating leases affected by this recall, which reflected the anticipated delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles. For the operating lease assets that did not pass the test for recoverability, we recognized $6 million of impairment losses in the United States segment and $2 million of impairment losses in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2016. The loss on lease residual values of direct financing leases recognized in the Canada segment attributable to the expected delay in disposition of lease vehicles affected by this recall was approximately $5 million. During the second half of fiscal year 2017, we began repairing and selling the affected returned lease vehicles. Only a limited number of affected returned lease vehicles were still held for disposition as of March 31, 2017, which we expect to sell during fiscal year 2018. We did not recognize impairment losses due to declines in estimated residual values during fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2015.\n\nFor operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of each lease and recognized as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed.\nIn the Canada segment, the provision for credit losses on our finance receivables was $10 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $15 million during fiscal year 2016. The decline in the provision for credit losses was due in part to a decline in net charge-offs. Early termination losses on operating lease assets was $6 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $5 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets.\nIn the United States segment, retail loan acquisition volumes increased by 12% and lease acquisition volumes increased by 3% during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to an increase in incentive program volumes. AHM continued to focus its support on lease incentive programs compared with retail loan incentive programs during fiscal year 2017.\nThe risk retention regulations in Regulation RR of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), require the sponsor to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized receivables, either directly or through one or more majority-owned affiliates. Standard risk retention options allow the sponsor to retain either an eligible vertical interest, an eligible horizontal residual interest, or a combination of both. AHFC has satisfied this obligation by retaining an eligible vertical interest of an amount equal to at least 5% of the principal amount of each class of note and certificate issued for the securitization transaction that was subject to this rule but may choose to use other structures in the future.\nIn the Canada segment, retail loan acquisition volumes increased by 11% during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher retail loan incentive volumes. Lease acquisition volumes were consistent during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Outstanding direct financing lease assets continued to decline and operating lease assets continued to increase during fiscal year 2017 as the result of our remaining direct financing leases maturing and all newly acquired leases being classified as operating leases.\nOperating lease revenue, net of depreciation, increased by $133 million, or 13%, in the United States segment and by $42 million, or 46%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases were primarily attributable to the growth in our operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments.\nDealer Financing\nEarly termination losses on operating leases in the United States segment increased by $26 million, or 63%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets and an increase in the mix of leases with lower credit grades. During fiscal year 2016, we reduced our estimate of early termination losses which lowered the amount of losses we recognized during the period. Early termination losses on operating leases in the Canada segment increased by $1 million, or 20%, primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets. See -Financial Condition-Credit Risk\u201d below for more information.\n (2) Represents the number of retail loans and leases acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and/or HCI and only those contracts with subsidy payments. Excludes contracts where contractual rates met or exceeded our yield requirements and subsidy payments were not required. \nThe following table summarizes the percentage of AHM and/or HCI sales of new automobiles and motorcycles that were financed either with retail loans or leases that we acquired:\n\n (1) A unit represents one retail loan or lease contract, as noted, that was originated in the United States and acquired by AHFC or its subsidiaries, or that was originated in Canada and acquired by HCFI, in each case during the period shown. \nGain/loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt\nThe Euro MTN Programme was retired in August 2014. Notes under this program that are currently listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange will remain listed through their maturity. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of Euro MTNs outstanding under this program ranged from 356 days to approximately 5.9 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Euro MTNs was 2.2 years as of March 31, 2017. Interest rates on outstanding Euro MTNs are fixed or floating. Euro MTNs were issued pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Euro MTNs.\n (2) Interest payments on floating rate and foreign currency denominated debt based on the applicable floating rates and/or exchange rates as of March 31, 2017. \nInterest expense\nThe Public MTNs may have original maturities of 9 months or more from the date of issue, may be interest bearing with either fixed or floating interest rates, or may be discounted notes. During fiscal year 2017, AHFC issued $7.7 billion aggregate principal amount of MTNs denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and Sterling, with an original maturity ranging from 1.0 year to 10.0 years, bearing interest at fixed and floating rates. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all Public MTNs outstanding ranged from 35 days to approximately 9.4 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Public MTNs was 2.7 years as of March 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations, excluding lending commitments to dealers and derivative obligations, by fiscal year payment period, as of March 31, 2017:\n (3) Provisions for past due operating lease rental payments are also included in total provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. \nThe following table summarizes our outstanding dealer financing asset balances and units:\nConsumer finance receivables are collectively evaluated for impairment. Delinquencies and losses are monitored on an ongoing basis and this historical experience provides the primary basis for estimating the allowance. Management utilizes various methodologies when estimating the allowance for credit losses including models which incorporate vintage loss and delinquency migration analysis. These models take into consideration attributes of the portfolio, including loan-to-value ratios, internal and external credit scores, collateral types, and loan terms. Market and economic factors such as used vehicle prices, unemployment rates, and consumer debt service burdens are also incorporated into these models. Estimated losses on operating leases expected to terminate early due to lessee defaults are also determined collectively, consistent with the methodologies used for consumer finance receivables.\n\nOther Credit Agreements\nDealer Financing Asset Balances\nKeep Well Agreements\nAs of March 31, 2017, AHFC and its consolidated subsidiaries had $57.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities, including current liabilities, of which $15.2 billion consisted of indebtedness and liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries. None of AHFC's consolidated subsidiaries had any outstanding preferred equity.\nReferences in this report to our fiscal year 2017\u201d and fiscal year 2016\u201d refer to our fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture, which requires HCFI to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that HCFI was in compliance with all covenants contained in the privately placed notes.\nHMC has entered into separate Keep Well Agreements with AHFC and HCFI. For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 1. Business-Relationships with HMC and Affiliates-HMC and AHFC Keep Well Agreement\u201d and Part I, Item 1. Business-Relationships with HMC and Affiliates-HMC and HCFI Keep Well Agreement.\u201d\nAHFC maintains a $3.5 billion 364-day credit agreement, which expires on March 2, 2018, a $2.1 billion three-year credit agreement, which expires on March 3, 2020, and a $1.4 billion five-year credit agreement, which expires on March 3, 2022. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under the AHFC credit agreements. AHFC intends to renew or replace these credit agreements prior to or on their respective expiration dates.\nThe following table summarizes the number of dealerships with wholesale flooring financing agreements as a percentage of total Honda and Acura dealerships in the United States and/or Canada, as applicable:\nWe are required to consolidate the securitization trusts in our financial statements, which results in the securitizations being accounted for as on-balance sheet secured financings. The securitized receivables remain on our consolidated balance sheet along with the notes issued by the trusts. The notes are secured solely by the assets of the applicable trust and not by any of our other assets or those of other trusts. The assets of a trust are the only source of funds for repayment on the notes of such trust.\nWe analyze our operations in two business segments defined by geography: the United States and Canada. We measure the performance of our United States and Canada segments on a pre-tax basis before the effect of valuation adjustments on derivative instruments and revaluations of foreign currency denominated debt. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 15-Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables and the related discussion are presented based on our geographically segmented consolidated financial statements.\nSummary of Outstanding Debt\n\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for management's estimate of probable losses incurred on our finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses on past due operating lease rental payments. These estimates are evaluated by management, at minimum, on a quarterly basis.\nOur consolidated income before income taxes was $1,458 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $1,552 million in fiscal year 2015. This decrease of $94 million, or 6%, was primarily due to a loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt of $60 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to a gain of $353 million during fiscal year 2015, a decrease in retail loan revenues of $81 million, a decrease in direct financing lease revenues of $63 million, an increase in provision for credit losses of $36 million, an increase in interest expense of $12 million, an increase in early termination loss on operating leases of $9 million, an increase in loss on lease residual values of $9 million, and an incurrence of an impairment loss on operating leases of $8 million in fiscal year 2016, which did not occur in fiscal year 2015, partially offset by a gain on derivative instruments of $101 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to a loss of $326 million during fiscal year 2015, an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $98 million and an increase in gain on disposition of lease vehicles of $14 million.\nIn the United States segment, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments of $324 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $116 million during fiscal year 2016. The loss in fiscal year 2017 was attributable to losses on pay float interest rate swaps of $235 million and cross currency swaps of $228 million, which were partially offset by gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps of $139 million. The losses on pay float interest rate swaps and gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps during fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in interest rates. The losses on cross currency swaps during fiscal year 2017 were primarily attributable to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Sterling during the period. In the Canada segment, we recognized a gain on derivative instruments of $9 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $15 million during fiscal year 2016. The gains during fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in Canadian interest rates. See -Derivatives\u201d below for more information.\n \u2022 Yield supplement accounts-which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to supplement interest payments on notes. \n\nConsumer Financing\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents information with respect to our allowance for credit losses and credit loss experience of our finance receivables and losses related to lessee defaults on our operating leases:\n (1) Debt obligations reflect the remaining principal obligations of our outstanding debt and do not reflect unamortized debt discounts and fees. Repayment schedule of secured debt reflects payment performance assumptions on underlying receivables. Foreign currency denominated debt principal is based on exchange rates as of March 31, 2017. \nCommercial Paper\nSensitivity Analysis", "item_7_text": "Credit losses are an expected cost of extending credit. The majority of our credit risk is in consumer financing and to a lesser extent in dealer financing. Credit risk of our portfolio of consumer finance receivables can be affected by general economic conditions. Adverse changes such as a rise in unemployment rates can increase the likelihood of defaults. Declines in used vehicle prices can reduce the amount of recoveries on repossessed collateral. We manage our exposure to credit risk in retail loans and direct financing leases by monitoring and adjusting our underwriting standards, which affect the level of credit risk that we assume, pricing contracts for expected losses, and focusing collection efforts to minimize losses.\nRevenues\nAs of March 31, 2017, we had commercial paper programs in the United States of $7.0 billion and in Canada of C$2.0 billion ($1.5 billion). Interest rates on the commercial paper are fixed at the time of issuance. During fiscal year 2017, consolidated commercial paper month-end outstanding principal balances ranged from $4.5 billion to $6.6 billion and the outstanding daily balance averaged $5.8 billion.\nAHFC no longer issues MTNs under the Rule 144A Private MTN Program. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of Private MTNs outstanding ranged from 164 days to approximately 4.5 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of Private MTNs was 2.0 years as of March 31, 2017. Interest rates on outstanding Private MTNs were fixed. Private MTNs were issued pursuant to the terms of an issuing and paying agency agreement which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of defaults. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Private MTNs.\nCritical accounting policies are those accounting policies that require the application of our most difficult, subjective, or complex judgments, often requiring us to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods, or for which the use of different estimates that could have reasonably been used in the current period would have had a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations are discussed throughout Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d where such estimates affect reported and expected financial results. Different assumptions or changes in economic circumstances could result in additional changes to the determination of the allowance for credit losses and the determination of lease residual values.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nNo impairment losses due to declines in estimated residual values were recognized during the fiscal year 2017. Impairment losses on operating leases of $6 million were recognized in the United States segment and $2 million in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2016 due to the expected delay in disposition of lease vehicles affected by the recall in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\nOther Debt\nIf we had experienced a 10% increase in net charge-offs of finance receivables during fiscal year 2017, our provision for credit losses would have increased by approximately $28 million during the period. Similarly, if we had experienced a 10% increase in realized losses on the disposition of repossessed operating lease vehicles during the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2017, we would have recognized an additional $13 million in early termination losses in our consolidated statement of income during the period.\nIn the United States segment, we recognized a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $171 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $60 million during fiscal year 2016. The gain during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Sterling during the period.\nEarly termination loss on operating leases\nWe are also exposed to credit risk on our portfolio of operating lease assets. We expect a portion of our operating leases to terminate prior to their scheduled maturities when lessees default on their contractual obligations. Losses are generally realized upon the disposition of the repossessed operating lease vehicles. The factors affecting credit risk on our operating leases and our management of the risk are similar to that of our retail loans and direct financing leases.\n\nGain/loss on disposition of lease vehicles\nThe table below presents a summary of our outstanding debt by various funding sources:\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOur liquidity strategy is to fund current and future obligations through our cash flows from operations and our diversified funding programs in a cost and risk effective manner. Our cash flows are generally impacted by cash requirements related to the volume of finance receivable and operating lease acquisitions and various operating and funding costs incurred, which are largely funded through payments received on our assets and our funding sources outlined below. As noted, the levels of incentive financing sponsored by AHM and HCI can impact our financial results and liquidity from period to period. Increases or decreases in incentive financing programs typically increase or decrease our financing penetration rates, respectively, which result in increased or decreased acquisition volumes and increased or decreased liquidity needs, respectively. At acquisition, we receive the subsidy payments, which reduce the cost of consumer loan and lease contracts acquired, and we recognize such payments as revenue over the term of the loan or lease.\nRelated Party Debt\nThe credit agreements contain customary conditions to borrowing and customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens and limitations on mergers, consolidations and asset sales. The credit agreements also require AHFC and HCFI, respectively, to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth as defined in their respective credit agreements. The credit agreements, in addition to other customary events of default, include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. In addition, the AHFC and HCFI credit agreements contain provisions for default if HMC's obligations under the HMC-AHFC Keep Well Agreement or the HMC-HCFI Keep Well Agreement, as applicable, become invalid, voidable, or unenforceable. All of these conditions, covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the credit agreements. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in the respective credit agreements.\nConsumer Financing Acquisition Volumes\nA substantial portion of our consumer financing business is acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI. The volume of incentive financing programs and the allocation of those programs between retail loans and leases may vary from fiscal period to fiscal period depending upon the respective marketing strategies of AHM and HCI. AHM and HCI's marketing strategies are based in part on their business planning, in which we do not participate. Therefore, we cannot predict the level of incentive financing programs AHM and HCI may sponsor in the future. Our consumer financing acquisition volumes are substantially dependent on the extent to which incentive financing programs are offered. Increases in incentive financing programs generally increase our financing penetration rates, which typically results in increased financing acquisition volumes for us. The amount of subsidy payments we receive from AHM and HCI is dependent on the terms of the incentive financing programs and the interest rate environment. Subsidy payments are received upon acquisition and recognized in revenue throughout the life of the loan or lease; therefore, a significant change in the level of incentive financing programs in a fiscal period often may not be reflected in our results of operations for that period. The amount of subsidy income we recognize in a fiscal period is dependent on the cumulative level of subsidized contracts outstanding that were acquired through incentive financing programs.\nDetermination of Lease Residual Values\nThe following table summarizes our outstanding retail loan and lease asset balances and units:\nDuring fiscal year 2017, AHFC entered into four floating rate term loan agreements for an aggregate of $1.6 billion and HCFI entered into two floating rate term loan agreements for an aggregate of C$375 million ($282 million). As of March 31, 2017, we had bank loans denominated in U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars with floating interest rates, in principal amounts ranging from $38 million to $600 million. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all bank loans outstanding ranged from 77 days to approximately 5.5 years. The weighted average remaining maturities on all bank loans was 3.2 years as of March 31, 2017.\nOur consolidated effective tax rate was 36.7% for fiscal year 2017 and 37.6% for fiscal year 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to a change in the estimated state tax rate and the effect of state tax law changes. For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 7-Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Overcollateralization-which occurs when the principal balance of securitized assets exceed the balance of securities issued by the trust. \nThe Public MTNs are issued pursuant to an indenture, which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions and restrictions on AHFC's ability to merge, consolidate or transfer substantially all of its assets or the assets of its subsidiaries, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants under the indenture.\nLoss on lease residual values in the Canada segment increased by $2 million, or 15%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to higher expected loss severities. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\n (2) Includes vehicles purchased by lessees or dealers for the contractual residual value at lease maturity or the outstanding contractual balance if purchased prior to lease maturity. \nThe following table summarizes the percentage of AHM unit sales in the United States and/or HCI unit sales in Canada, as applicable, that we financed through wholesale flooring loans with dealerships:\nWe enter into securitization transactions for funding purposes. Securitization transactions involve transferring pools of retail loans to trusts. The trusts are special-purpose entities that we establish to accommodate securitization structures. Securitization trusts have the limited purpose of acquiring assets, issuing asset-backed securities, and making payments on the securities. Assets transferred to securitization trusts are considered to be legally isolated from us and the claims of our creditors. We continue to service the retail loans transferred to the trusts. Investors in the notes issued by a trust only have recourse to the assets of such trust and do not have recourse to AHFC, HCFI, or our other subsidiaries or to other trusts.\nIn our business operations, we incur costs related to funding, credit loss, residual value loss, and general and administrative expenses, among other expenses.\nEuro MTN Programme\nWe assess our estimates for end of lease term market values of leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and expected loss severities. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends, and market information on new and used vehicles. Our leasing volumes and leasing volumes across the automotive industry have increased significantly in recent years. As a result, the supply of off-lease vehicles will continue to increase over the next several years which could negatively impact used vehicle prices. For operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the lease and recognized as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed. Additional information regarding lease residual values is provided in the discussion of -Critical Accounting Policies-Determination of Lease Residual Values\u201d below.\nConsumer Financing Penetration Rates\nRevenue from dealer loans in the United States segment increased by $24 million, or 22%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans and higher yields on such loans. Revenue from dealer loans in the Canada segment increased by $1 million, or 8%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to an increase in average outstanding dealer loans.\n (1) Ending and average receivable balances exclude the allowance for credit losses, write-down of lease residual values, unearned subvention income related to our incentive financing programs and deferred origination costs. Average receivable balances are calculated based on the average of each month's ending receivables balance for that fiscal year. \nDerivatives\nAHFC is a well-known seasoned issuer under SEC rules and issues Public MTNs pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC. In August 2016, AHFC filed a registration statement with the SEC under which it may issue from time to time up to $30.0 billion aggregate principal amount of Public MTNs. During fiscal year 2016, AHFC began issuing foreign currency denominated notes into international markets under this program. The aggregate principal amount of MTNs offered under this program may be increased from time to time.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we issued notes through asset-backed securitizations totaling $5.7 billion, which were secured by consumer finance receivables with an initial principal balance of $6.3 billion.\nAdditional information regarding credit losses is provided in the discussion of -Critical Accounting Policies-Credit Losses\u201d below.\nSecured Debt\nIn an effort to minimize liquidity risk and interest rate risk and the resulting negative effects on our margins, results of operations and cash flows, our funding strategy incorporates investor diversification and the utilization of multiple funding sources including commercial paper, medium term notes, bank loans and asset-backed securities. AHFC has reduced the use of related party debt as a funding source. As of March 31, 2017 AHFC had no outstanding notes issued to AHM. We incorporate a funding strategy that takes into consideration factors such as the interest rate environment, domestic and foreign capital market conditions, maturity profiles, and economic conditions. We believe that our funding sources, combined with cash provided by operating and investing activities, will provide sufficient liquidity for us to meet our debt service and working capital requirements over the next twelve months.\n (1) A unit represents one terminated lease by their method of disposition during the period shown. Unit counts do not include leases that were terminated due to lessee defaults. \nPublic MTN Program\nFinancial Condition\n \u2022 Reserve funds-which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to cover shortfalls in payments of interest and principal required to be paid on the notes. \nWe seek to maintain high quality consumer and dealer account portfolios, which we support with strong underwriting standards, risk-based pricing, and effective collection capabilities. Our cost of funds is facilitated by the diversity of our funding sources, and effective interest rate and foreign currency exchange risk management. We manage expenses to increase our profitability, including adjusting staffing needs based upon our business volumes and centralizing support functions. Additionally, we use risk and compliance management practices to optimize credit and residual value risk levels and maintain compliance with our pricing, underwriting and servicing policies at the United States, Canadian, state and provincial levels.\n (2) Securitized retail loans represent the portion of total retail loans that have been sold in securitization transactions but continue to be recognized on our balance sheet. Securitized retail loans are included in the amounts for total retail loans. \nWholesale Flooring Financing Percentage of Sales\nCredit Agreements\n \u2022 Subordinated certificates-which are securities issued by the trusts that are retained by us and are subordinated in priority of payment to the notes. \nRevenue from retail loans in the United States segment declined by $11 million, or 1%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The decline in revenue was primarily attributable to lower average outstanding retail loans, which was partially offset by higher yields on such loans. Revenue from retail loans in the Canada segment increased by $14 million, or 10%, primarily due to higher average outstanding retail loans.\nOur consolidated income before income taxes was $1,190 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to $1,458 million in fiscal year 2016. This decline of $268 million, or 18%, was primarily due to a loss on derivative instruments of $315 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $101 million during fiscal year 2016, an increase in interest expense of $136 million, an increase in provision for credit loss of $60 million, a decline in revenue from direct financing leases of $38 million, an increase in general and administrative expenses of $31 million and an increase in early termination loss on operating leases of $27 million, partially offset by a gain on the revaluation of foreign currency denominated debt of $171 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $60 million during fiscal year 2016, an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $175 million and an increase in revenue from dealer loans of $25 million.\nLease Residual Value Risk\nGain/loss on derivative instruments\nAsset-Backed Securities\nOur allowance for credit losses and early termination losses on operating leases requires significant judgment about inherently uncertain factors. The estimates are based on management's evaluation of many factors, including our historical credit loss experience, the value of the underlying collateral, delinquency trends, and economic conditions. The estimates are based on information available as of each reporting date. Actual losses may differ from the original estimates due to actual results varying from those assumed in our estimates.\nContractual Obligations\nAHFC maintains other committed lines of credit that allow the Company access to an additional $1.0 billion in unsecured funding with multiple banks. The credit agreements contain customary covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales and a requirement for AHFC to maintain a positive consolidated tangible net worth. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under these agreements. These agreements expire in September 2017. AHFC intends to renew these credit agreements prior to or on their expiration dates.\nWe utilize derivative instruments to mitigate exposures to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The types of derivative instruments include interest rate swaps, basis swaps, and cross currency swaps. Interest rate and basis swap agreements are used to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations of our floating rate debt relative to our fixed rate finance receivables and operating lease assets. Cross currency swap agreements are used to manage currency and interest rate risk exposure on foreign currency denominated debt. The derivative instruments contain an element of credit risk in the event the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of the agreements.\nIf future estimated auction values for all outstanding operating leases as of March 31, 2017 were to decrease by $100 per unit from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $66 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. If future return rates for all operating leases were to increase by one percentage point from our current estimates, the total impact would be an increase of approximately $11 million in depreciation expense, which would be recognized over the remaining lease terms. This sensitivity analysis may be asymmetric and is specific to the conditions in effect as of March 31, 2017. Additionally, any declines in auction values are likely to have a negative effect on return rates which could affect the severity of the impact on our results of operations.\nOur bank loans contain customary restrictive covenants, including limitations on liens, mergers, consolidations and asset sales, and a financial covenant that requires us to maintain positive consolidated tangible net worth. In addition to other customary events of default, the bank loans include cross-default provisions and provisions for default if HMC does not maintain ownership, whether directly or indirectly, of at least 80% of the outstanding capital stock of AHFC or HCFI, as applicable. All of these covenants and events of default are subject to important limitations and exceptions under the agreements governing the bank loans. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC and HCFI were in compliance with all covenants contained in our bank loans.\nSegment Results-Comparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2017 and 2016\nIncome tax expense\nSyndicated Bank Credit Facilities\nResults of Operations\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (2) For the purposes of determining whether a contract is delinquent, payment is generally considered to have been made, in the case of (i) dealer finance receivables, upon receipt of 100% of the payment when due and (ii) consumer finance receivables, upon receipt of 90% of the sum of the current monthly payment plus any overdue monthly payments. Delinquent amounts presented are the aggregated principal balances of delinquent finance receivables. \n (3) Includes vehicles sold through online auctions and market based pricing options under our dealer direct programs or through physical auctions. \nConsolidated subsidy income from AHM and HCI sponsored incentive programs increased by $156 million, or 14%, to $1,232 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $1,076 million during fiscal year 2016. This increase was primarily attributable to higher average outstanding incentive leases.\n\nInterest expense in the United States segment increased by $120 million, or 23%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher average interest rates. Interest expense in the Canada segment increased by $16 million, or 22%, due to an increase in average outstanding debt and higher average interest rates. See -Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for more information.\nAll derivative financial instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as assets or liabilities, and carried at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized in our consolidated statements of income in the period of the change. Since we do not elect to apply hedge accounting, the impact to earnings resulting from these valuation adjustments as reported under GAAP is not representative of our results of operations as evaluated by management. Realized gains and losses on derivative instruments, net of realized gains and losses on foreign currency denominated debt, are included in the measure of net revenues when we evaluate segment performance. Refer to Note 15-Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about segment information and Note 5-Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative instruments.\nAHFC issues fixed rate notes to AHM to help fund AHFC's general corporate operations. As of March 31, 2017, AHFC had no outstanding notes issued to AHM. HCFI issues fixed rate notes to HCI to help fund HCFI's general corporate operations. Interest rates are based on prevailing rates of debt with comparable terms. Generally, the term of these notes is less than 120 days. During fiscal year 2017, consolidated related party debt month-end principal balances ranged from $1.2 billion to $2.3 billion and the outstanding daily balance averaged $1.9 billion.\nLoss on lease residual values\n (1) A unit represents one automobile, motorcycle, power equipment, or marine engine, as applicable, financed through a wholesale flooring loan that was outstanding as of the date shown. \nWe are not a party to off-balance sheet arrangements.\nSensitivity Analysis\nCredit Losses\nWholesale Flooring Financing Penetration Rates\nThe table below presents a summary of outstanding debt issued under our MTN Programs by currency:\nThe following table summarizes the number of retail loans and leases we acquired and the number of such loans and leases acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and HCI:\nDepreciation on operating leases\n (1) A unit represents one retail loan or lease contract, as noted, that was outstanding as of the date shown. \nOur primary focus, in collaboration with AHM and HCI, is to provide support for the sale of Honda and Acura products and maintain customer and dealer satisfaction and loyalty. To deliver this support effectively, we seek to maintain competitive cost of funds, efficient operations, and effective risk and compliance management. The primary factors influencing our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition include the volume of Honda and Acura sales and the portion of those sales that we finance, our cost of funds, competition from other financial institutions, consumer credit defaults, and used motor vehicle prices.\nOperating lease revenue increased by $524 million, or 10%, in the United States segment and by $286 million, or 57%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases in revenue were due to higher average outstanding operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments.\nRefer to Note 1(o) -Recently Adopted Accounting Standards and Note 1(p)-Recently Issued Accounting Standards of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAn allowance for credit losses is maintained for management's estimate of probable losses incurred on finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses for estimated probable losses incurred on past due operating lease rental payments.\nDirect financing lease revenue, which is generated only in Canada, declined by $38 million, or 53%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 due to the continued decline in outstanding direct financing lease assets.\nContractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealer are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of lease term. We assess our estimates for end of term market values of the leased vehicles, at minimum, on a quarterly basis. The primary factors affecting the estimates are the percentage of leased vehicles that we expect to be returned by the lessee at the end of lease term and expected loss severities. Factors considered in this evaluation include, among other factors, economic conditions, historical trends and market information on new and used vehicles. Our leasing volumes and leasing volumes across the automotive industry have increased significantly in recent years. As a result, the supply of off-lease vehicles will continue to increase over the next several years which could negatively impact used vehicle prices.\nThe gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the United States segment declined by $22 million, or 48%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The lower gain was due to a decline in auction prices during the period and the impact of the delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles that were affected by the recall announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The gain on disposition of lease vehicles in the Canada segment increased by $14 million, or 280%. The increase in gains was primarily the result of more favorable vehicle return rates and disposition proceeds than the assumptions that were reflected in their estimated residual values. See -Financial Condition-Lease Residual Value Risk\u201d below for more information.\nThe following table presents our income before income taxes:\nConsumer Financing Asset Balances\nProvision for credit losses\n\nIn the United States segment, the provision for credit losses on our finance receivables was $177 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $116 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages. Default frequencies and loss severities have increased in recent vintages, due in part to the increase in the volume of retail loans with 72-month terms. We recognized early termination losses on operating lease assets of $67 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $41 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets and an increase in the mix of leases with lower credit grades.\n\nOur contractual obligations on derivative instruments are also excluded from the table above because our future cash obligations under these contracts are inherently uncertain. We recognize all derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value. The amounts recognized as fair value do not represent the amounts that will be ultimately paid or received upon settlement under these contracts. Refer to Note 5-Derivative Instruments of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on derivative instruments.\nHCFI issues privately placed Canadian dollar denominated notes, with either fixed or floating interest rates. During fiscal year 2017, HCFI entered into four private placement trades for an aggregate of C$1.2 billion ($901 million). As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all of HCFI's Canadian notes outstanding ranged from 7 days to approximately 5.3 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of these notes was 2.5 years as of March 31, 2017.\nIndebtedness of Consolidated Subsidiaries\nRefer to Note 1(e)-Finance Receivables, Note 1(f)-Investment in Operating Leases and Note 1(i)-Vehicles Held for Disposition of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding charge-offs or write-downs of contractual balances of retail and dealer finance receivables and operating leases.\n \u2022 Excess interest-which allows excess interest collections to be used to cover losses on defaulted loans. \nDealer finance receivables are individually evaluated for impairment when specifically identified as impaired. Dealer finance receivables are considered to be impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the loan. Our determination of whether dealer loans are impaired is based on evaluations of dealership payment history, financial condition, and cash flows, and their ability to perform under the terms of the loans. Dealer loans that have not been specifically identified as impaired are collectively evaluated for impairment.\nThis report contains translations of certain foreign currency amounts into U.S. dollars at the rates specified below solely for your convenience. These translations should not be construed as representations that the foreign currency amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts or that they could be converted into U.S. dollars at the rates indicated. U.S. dollar equivalents for C$\u201d (Canadian dollar), \u20ac\u201d (Euro) and \u00a3\u201d (Sterling) amounts are calculated based on the exchange rates on March 31, 2017 of 1.3318, 0.9360 and 0.7978, respectively, per U.S. dollar.\nNew Accounting Standards\nResults of operations for the United States segment and the Canada segment are summarized below:\nWe also review our investment in operating leases for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable. If impairment conditions are met, impairment losses are measured by the amount carrying values exceed their fair values.\nCredit Risk\nPrivate MTN Program\n\nOur securitizations are structured to provide credit enhancements to investors in the notes issued by the trusts. Credit enhancements can include the following:\nThe following table summarizes our number of lease terminations and the method of disposition:\nThe obligations in the above table do not include certain lending commitments to dealers since the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. Refer to Note 9-Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on these commitments.\nAs consideration for HMC's obligations under the Keep Well Agreements, we have agreed to pay HMC a quarterly fee based on the amount of outstanding Debt pursuant to support compensation agreements, dated October 1, 2005. We incurred expenses of $20 million, $18 million and $17 million during fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, pursuant to these support compensation agreements.\nOverview\nHCFI maintains a C$1.6 billion ($1.2 billion) credit agreement, as amended, which provides that HCFI may borrow up to C$800 million ($601 million) on a one-year and up to C$800 million ($601 million) on a five-year revolving basis. The one-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2018 and the five-year tranche of the credit agreement expires on March 24, 2022. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under the HCFI credit agreement. HCFI intends to renew or replace the credit agreement prior to or on the expiration date of each respective tranche.\nCredit risk on dealer loans is affected primarily by the financial strength of the dealers within the portfolio, the value of collateral securing the financings, and economic and market factors that could affect the creditworthiness of dealers. We manage our exposure to credit risk in dealer financing by performing comprehensive reviews of dealers prior to establishing financing arrangements and monitoring the payment performance and creditworthiness of these dealers on an ongoing basis. In the event of default by a dealer, we seek all available legal remedies pursuant to related dealer agreements, guarantees, security interests on collateral, or liens on dealership assets. Additionally, we have entered into agreements with AHM and HCI that provide for their repurchase, at the outstanding financed amount, of new, unused, undamaged and unregistered vehicle or equipment that have been repossessed from dealers who defaulted under the terms of its wholesale flooring agreement.\nBank Loans\nThe provision for credit losses in the United States segment increased by $65 million, or 49%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increase in the provision was the result of higher net charge-offs and increasing our allowance for credit losses to reflect weaker credit performance of recent vintages due in part to the increase in the volume of retail loans with 72-month terms. The provision for credit losses in the Canada segment declined by $5 million, or 31%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016, due to lower net charge-offs. See -Financial Condition-Credit Risk\u201d below for more information.\n\nMedium Term Note (MTN) Programs\nDepreciation on operating leases increased by $391 million, or 10%, in the United States segment and by $244 million, or 60%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases in depreciation were primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments. The increases in depreciation were also due in part to declines in estimated used vehicle prices in both the United States and Canada segments.\nContractual residual values of lease vehicles are determined at lease inception based on expectations of future used vehicle values, taking into consideration external industry data and our own historical experience. Lease customers have the option at the end of the lease term to return the vehicle to the dealer or to buy the vehicle at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance). Returned lease vehicles can be purchased by the grounding dealer at the contractual residual value (or if purchased prior to lease maturity, for the outstanding contractual balance) or for a market based price. Returned lease vehicles that are not purchased by the grounding dealers are sold through online and physical auctions. We are exposed to risk of loss on the disposition of returned lease vehicles when the proceeds from the sale of the vehicles are less than the contractual residual values at the end of the lease term.\n\nImpairment loss on operating leases\nCertain Honda and Acura vehicles were recalled during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 based on a determination of a safety related defect in driver's airbag inflators. AHM and HCI instructed their authorized dealers to cease the sale of affected new and used vehicles until the recall repairs were completed. Tests for recoverability were performed on operating leases affected by this recall, which reflected the anticipated delays in the disposition of returned lease vehicles. For the operating lease assets that did not pass the test for recoverability, we recognized $6 million of impairment losses in the United States segment and $2 million of impairment losses in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2016. The loss on lease residual values of direct financing leases recognized in the Canada segment attributable to the expected delay in disposition of lease vehicles affected by this recall was approximately $5 million. During the second half of fiscal year 2017, we began repairing and selling the affected returned lease vehicles. Only a limited number of affected returned lease vehicles were still held for disposition as of March 31, 2017, which we expect to sell during fiscal year 2018. We did not recognize impairment losses due to declines in estimated residual values during fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2015.\n\nFor operating leases, adjustments to estimated residual values are made on a straight-line basis over the remaining term of each lease and recognized as depreciation expense. For direct financing leases, downward adjustments for declines in estimated residual values deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as a loss on lease residual values in the period in which the estimate changed.\nIn the Canada segment, the provision for credit losses on our finance receivables was $10 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $15 million during fiscal year 2016. The decline in the provision for credit losses was due in part to a decline in net charge-offs. Early termination losses on operating lease assets was $6 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to $5 million during fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets.\nIn the United States segment, retail loan acquisition volumes increased by 12% and lease acquisition volumes increased by 3% during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to an increase in incentive program volumes. AHM continued to focus its support on lease incentive programs compared with retail loan incentive programs during fiscal year 2017.\nThe risk retention regulations in Regulation RR of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), require the sponsor to retain an economic interest in the credit risk of the securitized receivables, either directly or through one or more majority-owned affiliates. Standard risk retention options allow the sponsor to retain either an eligible vertical interest, an eligible horizontal residual interest, or a combination of both. AHFC has satisfied this obligation by retaining an eligible vertical interest of an amount equal to at least 5% of the principal amount of each class of note and certificate issued for the securitization transaction that was subject to this rule but may choose to use other structures in the future.\nIn the Canada segment, retail loan acquisition volumes increased by 11% during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 primarily due to higher retail loan incentive volumes. Lease acquisition volumes were consistent during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. Outstanding direct financing lease assets continued to decline and operating lease assets continued to increase during fiscal year 2017 as the result of our remaining direct financing leases maturing and all newly acquired leases being classified as operating leases.\nOperating lease revenue, net of depreciation, increased by $133 million, or 13%, in the United States segment and by $42 million, or 46%, in the Canada segment during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increases were primarily attributable to the growth in our operating lease assets in both the United States and Canada segments.\nDealer Financing\nEarly termination losses on operating leases in the United States segment increased by $26 million, or 63%, during fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016. The increase in early termination losses during fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets and an increase in the mix of leases with lower credit grades. During fiscal year 2016, we reduced our estimate of early termination losses which lowered the amount of losses we recognized during the period. Early termination losses on operating leases in the Canada segment increased by $1 million, or 20%, primarily due to the growth in operating lease assets. See -Financial Condition-Credit Risk\u201d below for more information.\n (2) Represents the number of retail loans and leases acquired through incentive financing programs sponsored by AHM and/or HCI and only those contracts with subsidy payments. Excludes contracts where contractual rates met or exceeded our yield requirements and subsidy payments were not required. \nThe following table summarizes the percentage of AHM and/or HCI sales of new automobiles and motorcycles that were financed either with retail loans or leases that we acquired:\n\n (1) A unit represents one retail loan or lease contract, as noted, that was originated in the United States and acquired by AHFC or its subsidiaries, or that was originated in Canada and acquired by HCFI, in each case during the period shown. \nGain/loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt\nThe Euro MTN Programme was retired in August 2014. Notes under this program that are currently listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange will remain listed through their maturity. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of Euro MTNs outstanding under this program ranged from 356 days to approximately 5.9 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Euro MTNs was 2.2 years as of March 31, 2017. Interest rates on outstanding Euro MTNs are fixed or floating. Euro MTNs were issued pursuant to the terms of an agency agreement which requires AHFC to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that AHFC was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Euro MTNs.\n (2) Interest payments on floating rate and foreign currency denominated debt based on the applicable floating rates and/or exchange rates as of March 31, 2017. \nInterest expense\nThe Public MTNs may have original maturities of 9 months or more from the date of issue, may be interest bearing with either fixed or floating interest rates, or may be discounted notes. During fiscal year 2017, AHFC issued $7.7 billion aggregate principal amount of MTNs denominated in U.S. dollars, Euro and Sterling, with an original maturity ranging from 1.0 year to 10.0 years, bearing interest at fixed and floating rates. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining maturities of all Public MTNs outstanding ranged from 35 days to approximately 9.4 years. The weighted average remaining maturities of all Public MTNs was 2.7 years as of March 31, 2017.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations, excluding lending commitments to dealers and derivative obligations, by fiscal year payment period, as of March 31, 2017:\n (3) Provisions for past due operating lease rental payments are also included in total provision for credit losses in our consolidated statements of income. \nThe following table summarizes our outstanding dealer financing asset balances and units:\nConsumer finance receivables are collectively evaluated for impairment. Delinquencies and losses are monitored on an ongoing basis and this historical experience provides the primary basis for estimating the allowance. Management utilizes various methodologies when estimating the allowance for credit losses including models which incorporate vintage loss and delinquency migration analysis. These models take into consideration attributes of the portfolio, including loan-to-value ratios, internal and external credit scores, collateral types, and loan terms. Market and economic factors such as used vehicle prices, unemployment rates, and consumer debt service burdens are also incorporated into these models. Estimated losses on operating leases expected to terminate early due to lessee defaults are also determined collectively, consistent with the methodologies used for consumer finance receivables.\n\nOther Credit Agreements\nDealer Financing Asset Balances\nKeep Well Agreements\nAs of March 31, 2017, AHFC and its consolidated subsidiaries had $57.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities, including current liabilities, of which $15.2 billion consisted of indebtedness and liabilities of our consolidated subsidiaries. None of AHFC's consolidated subsidiaries had any outstanding preferred equity.\nReferences in this report to our fiscal year 2017\u201d and fiscal year 2016\u201d refer to our fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 and our fiscal year ended March 31, 2016, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended March 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe notes are issued pursuant to the terms of an indenture, which requires HCFI to comply with certain covenants, including negative pledge provisions, and includes customary events of default. As of March 31, 2017, management believes that HCFI was in compliance with all covenants contained in the privately placed notes.\nHMC has entered into separate Keep Well Agreements with AHFC and HCFI. For additional information, refer to Part I, Item 1. Business-Relationships with HMC and Affiliates-HMC and AHFC Keep Well Agreement\u201d and Part I, Item 1. Business-Relationships with HMC and Affiliates-HMC and HCFI Keep Well Agreement.\u201d\nAHFC maintains a $3.5 billion 364-day credit agreement, which expires on March 2, 2018, a $2.1 billion three-year credit agreement, which expires on March 3, 2020, and a $1.4 billion five-year credit agreement, which expires on March 3, 2022. As of March 31, 2017, no amounts were drawn upon under the AHFC credit agreements. AHFC intends to renew or replace these credit agreements prior to or on their respective expiration dates.\nThe following table summarizes the number of dealerships with wholesale flooring financing agreements as a percentage of total Honda and Acura dealerships in the United States and/or Canada, as applicable:\nWe are required to consolidate the securitization trusts in our financial statements, which results in the securitizations being accounted for as on-balance sheet secured financings. The securitized receivables remain on our consolidated balance sheet along with the notes issued by the trusts. The notes are secured solely by the assets of the applicable trust and not by any of our other assets or those of other trusts. The assets of a trust are the only source of funds for repayment on the notes of such trust.\nWe analyze our operations in two business segments defined by geography: the United States and Canada. We measure the performance of our United States and Canada segments on a pre-tax basis before the effect of valuation adjustments on derivative instruments and revaluations of foreign currency denominated debt. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 15-Segment Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables and the related discussion are presented based on our geographically segmented consolidated financial statements.\nSummary of Outstanding Debt\n\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for management's estimate of probable losses incurred on our finance receivables. We also maintain an estimate for early termination losses on operating lease assets due to lessee defaults and an allowance for credit losses on past due operating lease rental payments. These estimates are evaluated by management, at minimum, on a quarterly basis.\nOur consolidated income before income taxes was $1,458 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $1,552 million in fiscal year 2015. This decrease of $94 million, or 6%, was primarily due to a loss on foreign currency revaluation of debt of $60 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to a gain of $353 million during fiscal year 2015, a decrease in retail loan revenues of $81 million, a decrease in direct financing lease revenues of $63 million, an increase in provision for credit losses of $36 million, an increase in interest expense of $12 million, an increase in early termination loss on operating leases of $9 million, an increase in loss on lease residual values of $9 million, and an incurrence of an impairment loss on operating leases of $8 million in fiscal year 2016, which did not occur in fiscal year 2015, partially offset by a gain on derivative instruments of $101 million during fiscal year 2016 compared to a loss of $326 million during fiscal year 2015, an increase in operating lease revenue, net of depreciation, of $98 million and an increase in gain on disposition of lease vehicles of $14 million.\nIn the United States segment, we recognized a loss on derivative instruments of $324 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a gain of $116 million during fiscal year 2016. The loss in fiscal year 2017 was attributable to losses on pay float interest rate swaps of $235 million and cross currency swaps of $228 million, which were partially offset by gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps of $139 million. The losses on pay float interest rate swaps and gains on pay fixed interest rate swaps during fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in interest rates. The losses on cross currency swaps during fiscal year 2017 were primarily attributable to the U.S. dollar strengthening against the Euro and Sterling during the period. In the Canada segment, we recognized a gain on derivative instruments of $9 million during fiscal year 2017 compared to a loss of $15 million during fiscal year 2016. The gains during fiscal year 2017 were due to a rise in Canadian interest rates. See -Derivatives\u201d below for more information.\n \u2022 Yield supplement accounts-which are restricted cash accounts held by the trusts to supplement interest payments on notes. \n\nConsumer Financing\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents information with respect to our allowance for credit losses and credit loss experience of our finance receivables and losses related to lessee defaults on our operating leases:\n (1) Debt obligations reflect the remaining principal obligations of our outstanding debt and do not reflect unamortized debt discounts and fees. Repayment schedule of secured debt reflects payment performance assumptions on underlying receivables.

declined 18% to $1,190 million in fiscal year 2017 compared to $1,458 million in fiscal year 2016. This was mainly due to losses on derivative instruments, higher interest expense, increased provision for credit losses, lower direct financing lease revenue, and higher operating lease losses. \n\n- Revenue from operating leases, net of depreciation, increased 10% in the U.S. and 46% in Canada primarily due to growth in operating lease assets. Retail loan revenue declined slightly in the U.S. but increased 10% in Canada.\n\n- Provision for credit losses increased due to higher net charge-offs and weaker credit performance, especially for longer-term (72 month) U.S. retail loans. Early termination losses on operating leases also rose due to increased lease assets and lower credit grade mix. \n\n- Interest expense rose 23% in the U.S. and 22% in Canada due to higher debt balances and interest rates. Debt levels were up to fund increased auto lending.\n\n- A $315 million loss on derivatives was recognized in fiscal 2017 compared to a $101 million gain in fiscal 2016, driven by rising interest rates and currency fluctuations. \n\n- Operating lease revenue growth outpaced the increase in depreciation expense, resulting in higher operating lease profits.\n\n- Liquidity remained strong supported by a diversified funding strategy including commercial paper, medium term notes, bank loans and asset-backed securities.\n\nIn summary, while profits declined versus the prior year, the auto finance business continued to grow revenues and assets while maintaining a sound liquidity and risk management framework."}
