References to Barnes & Noble College\u201d or BNC\u201d refer to our subsidiary Barnes & Noble College Booksellers, LLC. References to MBS\u201d refer to our subsidiary MBS Textbook Exchange, LLC.\nOur fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of April. Fiscal 2022\u201d means the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Fiscal 2021\u201d means the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, and Fiscal 2020\u201d means the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.\nOverview\nDescription of business\nBarnes & Noble Education, Inc. ( BNED\u201d) is one of the largest contract operators of physical and virtual bookstores for college and university campuses and K-12 institutions across the United States. We are also one of the largest textbook wholesalers, inventory management hardware and software providers, and a leading provider of digital education solutions. We operate 1,427 physical, virtual, and custom bookstores and serve more than 6 million students, delivering essential educational content, tools and general merchandise within a dynamic omnichannel retail environment. Additionally, we offer direct-to-student products and services to help students study more effectively and improve academic performance.\nThe strengths of our business include our ability to compete by developing new products and solutions to meet market needs, our large operating footprint with direct access to students and faculty, our well-established, deep relationships with academic partners and stable, long-term contracts and our well-recognized brands. We expect to continue to introduce scalable and advanced digital solutions focused largely on the student, expand our e-commerce capabilities and accelerate such capabilities through our merchandising partnership with Fanatics Retail Group Fulfillment, LLC, Inc. ( Fanatics\u201d) and Fanatics Lids College, Inc. ( FLC\u201d) (collectively referred to herein as the FLC Partnership\u201d), increase market share with new accounts, and expand our strategic opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships.\nWe expect gross general merchandise sales to increase over the long term, as our product assortments continue to emphasize and reflect changing consumer trends, and we evolve our presentation concepts and merchandising of products in stores and online, which we expect to be further enhanced and accelerated through the FLC Partnership. Through this partnership, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our logo and emblematic general merchandise business.\nWe believe the Barnes & Noble brand (licensed from our former parent) along with our subsidiary brands, BNC and MBS, are synonymous with innovation in bookselling and campus retailing, and are widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large college footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students, and faculty, but are also important to our relationship with leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels, and for being a trusted source for students in our direct-to-student digital solutions business.\nFor a discussion of our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business.\nFirst Day Inclusive Access Programs\nWe provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. We offer our BNC First Day\u00ae inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day and First Day Complete, in which course materials, including both physical and digital content, are offered at a reduced price through a course fee or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class.\n\u2022Through First Day, digital course materials are adopted by a faculty member for a single course, and students receive their materials through their learning management system.\n\u2022First Day Complete is adopted by an institution and includes all classes, providing students both physical and digital materials. The First Day Complete model drives substantially greater unit sell-through for the bookstore.\nOffering courseware sales through our inclusive access First Day and First Day Complete models is a key, and increasingly important strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students, as well as the opportunity to improve student outcomes, while, at the same time, increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross profits of courseware sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. We expect these programs to allow us to ultimately reverse historical long-\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nterm trends in courseware revenue declines, which has occurred at those schools where such programs have been adopted. During Fiscal 2022, First Day total revenue increased 91% from the prior year period.\nPartnership with Fanatics and FLC\nIn December 2020, we entered into the FLC Partnership. Through this partnership, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our general merchandise business. Fanatics' cutting-edge e-commerce and technology expertise offers our campus stores expanded product selection, a world-class online and mobile experience, and a progressive direct-to-consumer platform. Coupled with Lids (FLC's parent company), the leading standalone brick and mortar retailer focused exclusively on licensed fan and alumni products, our campus stores have improved access to trend and sales performance data on licensees, product styles, and design treatments.\nWe maintain our relationships with campus partners and remain responsible for staffing and managing the day-to-day operations of our campus bookstores. We also work closely with our campus partners to ensure that each campus store maintains unique aspects of in-store merchandising, including localized product assortments and specific styles and designs that reflect each campus's brand. We leverage Fanatics' e-commerce technology and expertise for the operational management of the emblematic merchandise and gift sections of our campus store websites. FLC manages in-store assortment planning and merchandising of emblematic apparel, headwear, and gift products for our partner campus stores.\nIn December 2020, Fanatics, Inc. and Lids Holdings, Inc. jointly made a strategic equity investment in BNED. On April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement, we sold our logo and emblematic general merchandise inventory to FLC, which was finalized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. As contemplated by the FLC Partnership's e-commerce agreement, we began to transition certain of our e-commerce sites to Fanatics e-commerce sites for logo and emblematic products during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales on a gross basis prior to April 4, 2021. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Equity and Earnings Per Share.\nCOVID-19 Business Impact\nOur business experienced an unprecedented and significant negative impact as a result of COVID-19 related campus store closures. Beginning in March 2020, colleges and universities nationwide began to close their campuses in light of safety concerns and as a result of local and state issued stay-at-home orders. By mid-March, during our Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, we closed the majority of our physical campus stores to protect the health and safety of our customers and employees.\nWhile our campus stores were closed, we continued to serve institutions and students through our campus websites, providing free shipping on all orders and an expanded digital content offering to provide immediate access to course materials to students at our campuses that closed due to COVID-19. We developed and implemented plans to safely reopen our campus stores based on national, state and local guidelines, as well as the campus policies set by the school administration.\nDespite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. We cannot accurately predict the duration or extent of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, including variants, on enrollments, campus activities, university budgets, athletics and other areas that directly affect our business operations. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings, and its effect on our ability to source products, including textbooks and general merchandise offerings.\nAs we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales later into the quarter or shifting some sales to our fourth quarter. We will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and our campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management or market factors currently in place change, there could be a further impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nSegments\nWe have three reportable segments: Retail, Wholesale and DSS. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, continue to be presented as Corporate Services\u201d. The following discussion provides information regarding the three segments.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nRetail Segment\nThe Retail Segment operates 1,427 college, university, and K-12 school bookstores, comprised of 805 physical bookstores and 622 virtual bookstores. Our bookstores typically operate under agreements with the college, university, or K-12 schools to be the official bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products. The majority of the physical campus bookstores have school-branded e-commerce sites which we operate independently or along with our merchant partners, and which offer students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. The Retail Segment also offers inclusive access programs, in which course materials are offered at a reduced price through a fee charged by the institution or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. Additionally, the Retail Segment offers a suite of digital content and services to colleges and universities, including a variety of open educational resource-based courseware.\nWholesale Segment\nThe Wholesale Segment is comprised of our wholesale textbook business and is one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country. The Wholesale Segment centrally sources, sells, and distributes new and used textbooks to approximately 3,100 physical bookstores (including our Retail Segment's 805 physical bookstores) and sources and distributes new and used textbooks to our 622 virtual bookstores. Additionally, the Wholesale Segment sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 350 college bookstores.\nDSS Segment\nThe Digital Student Solutions (\"DSS\") Segment includes products and services to assist students to study more effectively and improve academic performance. The DSS Segment is comprised of the operations of Student Brands, LLC, a leading direct-to-student subscription-based writing services business, and bartleby\u00ae, an institutional and direct-to-student subscription-based offering providing textbook solutions, expert questions and answers, writing and tutoring.\nCorporate Services represents unallocated shared-service costs which include corporate level expenses and other governance functions, including executive functions, such as accounting, legal, treasury, information technology, and human resources.\nSeasonality\nOur business is highly seasonal. Our quarterly results also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods. Our fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of April.\nFor our retail operations, sales are generally highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks and other course materials, and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Sales attributable to our wholesale business are generally highest in our first, second and third quarter, as it sells textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. For our DSS segment, or direct-to-student business, sales and operating profit are realized relatively consistently throughout the year.\nTrends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business\nFor a discussion of our trends and other factors affecting our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business.\nResults of Operations\nElements of Results of Operations\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d).\nOur sales are primarily derived from the sale of course materials, which include new, used and digital textbooks, and at college and university bookstores which we operate, we sell high margin general merchandise, including emblematic apparel and gifts, trade books, computer products, school and dorm supplies, convenience and caf\u00e9 items and graduation products. Our rental income is primarily derived from the rental of physical textbooks. We also derive revenue from other sources, such as sales of inventory management, hardware and point-of-sale software, direct-to-student subscription-based services, and other services.\nOur cost of sales primarily includes costs such as merchandise costs, textbook rental amortization, content development cost amortization, warehouse costs related to inventory management and order fulfillment, insurance, certain payroll costs, and management service agreement costs, including rent expense, related to our college and university contracts and other facility related expenses.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nOur selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of store payroll and store operating expenses. Selling and administrative expenses also include long-term incentive plan compensation expense and general office expenses, such as merchandising, procurement, field support, finance and accounting, and operating costs related to our direct-to-student subscription-based services business. Shared-service costs such as human resources, legal, treasury, information technology, and various other corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are not allocated to any specific reporting segment and are recorded in Corporate Services as discussed in the Overview - Segments discussion above.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe results of operations reflected in our consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nResults of Operations - Summary\nOur Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 results have been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many schools continued to adjust their learning model and on-campus activities in response to the pandemic. See \"Overview\" for more information.\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended\nApril 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended\nMay 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>53 weeks ended\nMay 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Restated (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales: (b)(c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product sales and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,398,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,299,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,671,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,863 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,531,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,433,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,851,063 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(68,857) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(139,810) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,250) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(55,614) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(96,523) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,126) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,827) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wholesale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DSS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,524 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,409 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate Services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,002) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,079) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,403) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eliminations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>225 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,792) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(65,625) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,159 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.

The sales increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. The increase is offset by the negative impact on sales primarily due to lower enrollments, primarily at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings and lower logo and emblematic sales as they are reflected in sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021.

See the Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below.\nAdditionally, Product and other sales and Rental income are impacted by the growth of First Day Complete, comparable store sales, new store openings and store closings, as well as the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales were impacted by overall enrollment declines in higher education. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall 2021 semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, and the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings. While many college athletic conferences resumed their sport activities, other on campus events, such as parent's weekends or alumni events, continue to be\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\neither eliminated or severely restricted, which further impacted our general merchandise business. As we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales.\nProduct and other sales for Retail increased by $110.0 million, or 9.2%, to $1,306.3 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $1,196.3 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. During the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, course material sales increased by $54.4 million or 8.1% to $710.7 million, and general merchandise sales increased by $59.0 million or 11.8% to $558.8 million, offset by a decrease in service and other revenue of $2.4 million or 6.1% to $36.8 million. Course material rental income for Retail decreased by $0.8 million, or 0.6%, to $133.4 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $134.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The overall Retail sales increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. Course material sales were also impacted by lower enrollments, primarily at community colleges and by international students, and the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Retail Gross Comparable Store course material sales increased by 2.3%, as compared to a 15.2% decline a year ago, when the majority of our stores had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below. The increase in course material sales was reflective of the growth of First Day inclusive access programs, digital and eTextbook revenue increases, due to a shift to lower cost options and more affordable solutions, including digital offerings. For the 2022 Spring term, First Day Complete was offered through 76 campus bookstores compared to 14 campus bookstores in the prior year, at schools with over 380,000 in total undergraduate enrollment, up from approximately 62,000 in total undergraduate enrollment in the 2021 Spring term. Revenue for both of our First Day models increased to $234.2 million during Fiscal 2022, as compared to $122.7 million in the prior year period.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, logo and emblematic sales are reflected in sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis prior to April 4, 2021. See Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below. During the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Retail Gross Comparable Store general merchandise sales increased by 76.1%, as compared to a 45.9% decline a year ago. Both results during both periods benefited greatly from the return to an on campus learning experience and the resumption of many activities and events. Sales for general merchandise, including on-campus cafe and convenience products, and trade merchandise have increased compared to the prior year, when sales were impacted by the temporary store closings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, general merchandise sales are still impacted by fewer students returning to campus, as many schools implemented a remote or hybrid learning model and curtailed on-campus classes and activities.\nRetail Gross Comparable Store Sales\nTo supplement the Total Sales table presented above, the Company uses Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales as a key performance indicator. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales includes sales from physical and virtual stores that have been open for an entire fiscal year period and does not include sales from permanently closed stores for all periods presented. For Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales, sales for logo and emblematic general merchandise fulfilled by FLC, Fanatics and digital agency sales are included on a gross basis for consistent year-over-year comparison.\nEffective April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales to FLC and Fanatics. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021.\nWe believe the current Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales calculation method reflects management's view that such comparable store sales are an important measure of the growth in sales when evaluating how established stores have performed over time. We present this metric as additional useful information about the Company's operational and financial performance and to allow greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for operating and financial decision-making. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry and the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry.

The decrease is primarily due to lower gross sales impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply constraints resulting from the lack of on campus textbook buyback opportunities during the prior fiscal year, a decrease in customer demand resulting from a shift in buying patterns from physical textbooks to digital products, and lower demand from other third-party clients, partially offset by lower returns and allowances. During the prior year period, the Wholesale operations assumed direct-to-student fulfillment of course material orders for the Retail Segment campus bookstores that were not fully operational due to COVID-19 campus store closures, whereas the sales shifted back to the physical bookstores in the current period.\nDSS\nDSS total sales increased by $8.3 million, or 30.3%, to $35.7 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 20221 from $27.4 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Sales increased primarily due to an increase in subscription sales.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nOur cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales to 75.7% during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared to 82.4% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.

The increase in margin was also partially offset by higher contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts (60 basis points) resulting from contract renewals and new store contracts.\n\u2022Rental gross margin increased (750 basis points), driven primarily by lower contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts (750 basis points) and a favorable rental mix (50 basis points), partially offset by lower rental margin rates (50 basis points).\nWholesale\nThe cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $92.5 million, or 82.4% of sales, and $19.8 million, or 17.6% of sales, respectively, during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022. The cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $131.1 million, or 79.1% of sales, and $34.7 million, or 20.9% of sales, respectively, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The gross margin decreased to 17.6% during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from 20.9% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of returns and allowances and higher markdowns, partially offset by a favorable sales mix.\nDSS\nGross margin for the DSS segment was $29.9 million, or 83.9% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and $22.3 million, or 81.5% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The gross margins are driven primarily by high margin subscription service revenue earned.\nIntercompany Eliminations\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, sales eliminations were $56.2 million and $89.8 million, respectively. These sales eliminations represent the elimination of Wholesale sales and fulfillment service fees to Retail and the elimination of Retail commissions earned from Wholesale.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, the cost of sales eliminations were $56.2 million and $89.8 million, respectively. These cost of sales eliminations represent (i) the recognition of intercompany profit for Retail inventory that was purchased from Wholesale in a prior period that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period and the elimination of Wholesale service fees charged for fulfillment of inventory for virtual store sales, net of (ii) the elimination of intercompany profit for Wholesale inventory purchases by Retail that remain in ending inventory at the end of the current period.\nDuring both 52 weeks periods ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, the gross margin eliminations was $0.1 million.

The variances by segment are discussed by segment below. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\nRetail\nFor Retail, selling and administrative expenses increased by $37.0 million, or 13.3%, to $315.1 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $278.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $34.5 million increase in stores payroll and operating expenses including comparable stores, virtual stores and new/closed stores payroll and operating expenses, and a $2.5 million increase in corporate payroll, infrastructure and product development costs. The payroll increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWholesale\nFor Wholesale, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.5%, to $16.0 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $16.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower compensation expense and lower operating costs.\nDSS\nFor DSS, selling and administrative expenses increased by $7.4 million to $29.5 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The increase in costs was primarily driven by higher compensation expense, higher operating costs invested in the business associated with product development and sales infrastructure costs aimed at increasing revenue.\nCorporate Services\nCorporate Services' selling and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million, or 4.2%, to $23.0 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.

We have analyzed the provisions, which provide for a technical correction to allow for full expensing of qualified leasehold improvements, modifications to charitable contribution and net operating loss limitations ( NOLs\u201d), modifications to the deductibility of business interest expense, as well as Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit acceleration. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was an income tax benefit of $7.2 million for the carryback of NOLs to higher tax rate years, recorded in Fiscal 2021. As of May 1, 2021, we recognized a current income tax receivable for NOL carrybacks of $30.5 million in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.

The sales decrease is primarily related to the impact of the additional week for Fiscal 2020, the impact from temporary store closings related to COVID-19 earlier in the fiscal year, as well as lower in store foot traffic, lower enrollments and fewer on-campus events due to COVID-19.

Product and other sales are impacted by comparable store sales (as noted in the chart below), new store openings and store closings, as well as the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales were impacted by the temporary store closings due to COVID-19 earlier in the fiscal year, as well as the impact of fewer students returning to campus, as many schools implemented a remote learning model and curtailed on-campus classes and activities. While many big-conferences resumed their sport activities, fan attendance at the games was either eliminated or severely restricted, which further impacted the company's high-margin general merchandise business. Additionally, sales were impacted by overall enrollment declines in higher education. Textbook (Course Materials) revenue for Retail decreased primarily due to lower new and used textbook and other course materials sales, while First Day (our inclusive access program), digital and eTextbook revenue increased.\nEffective April 4, 2021, as per the FLC merchandising partnership agreement, logo and emblematic general merchandise sales were fulfilled by FLC and we recognized commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis. Additionally, general merchandise sales for Retail decreased primarily due to lower emblematic apparel sales (as many athletic events were canceled due to COVID-19), lower supply product sales and lower graduation product sales (primarily due to COVID-19 related campus\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nclosures). We have made continued progress in the development of our next generation e-commerce platform, which launched in Fiscal 2021 to deliver increased high-margin general merchandise sales.\nRental income for Retail decreased by $45.7 million, or 25.4%, to $134.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $179.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Rental income is impacted by comparable store sales, new store openings and store closings. The decrease in rental income is primarily due to decreased rental activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed above and the impact of increased digital offerings.\nComparable store sales for Retail decreased for the 52 week sales period. Comparable store sales were impacted primarily by COVID-19 related campus temporary store closures, lower enrollment and on-campus events (all discussed above), a shift to lower cost options and more affordable solutions, including digital offerings, increased consumer purchases directly from publishers and other online providers, lower general merchandise sales (including graduation products and logo products for athletic events). These decreases were partially offset by increased First Day, digital and eTextbook revenue. Comparable store sales variances for Retail by category for the 52 week period is as follows:\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable Store Sales variances for Retail (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>May 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Textbooks (Course Materials) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(158.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Merchandise </td> <td> </td> <td>(235.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Books </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Comparable Store Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(414.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Comparable sales data exclude the impact of the additional week for Fiscal 2020.

Sales for logo and emblematic general merchandise fulfilled by FLC inventory and digital agency sales are included on a gross basis. We believe the current comparable store sales calculation method reflects the manner in which management views comparable sales, as well as the seasonal nature of our business.\nWholesale\nWholesale sales decreased by $32.5 million, or 16.4%, to $165.8 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $198.3 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to decreased gross sales impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in customer demand resulting from a shift in buying patterns from physical textbooks to digital products, and lower demand from other third-party clients, partially offset by a lower returns and allowances.\nDSS\nDSS total sales increased by $3.7 million, or 15.7%, to $27.4 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $23.7 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, primarily due to higher bartleby subscription sales, which were partially offset by lower Student Brands sales.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nOur cost of sales increased as a percentage of sales to 82.4% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to 76.1% during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Our gross margin decreased by $189.9 million, or 42.9%, to $252.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $442.5 million, or 23.9% of sales, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we recognized a merchandise inventory loss and write-off of $15.0 million in cost of goods sold in the Retail Segment discussed below. Excluding the merchandise inventory loss and write-off, cost of goods sold and gross margin was 81.3% and 18.7%, respectively, of sales during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to 76.1% and 23.9%, respectively, of sales during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.

gross margin decreased (770 basis points), driven primarily by lower margin rates (435 basis points) due to higher markdowns, an unfavorable sales mix (370 basis points) due to lower high-margin general merchandise sales of approximately $231.2 million and the shift to lower margin digital courseware, and a merchandise inventory loss and write-off (100 basis points) of $15.0 million, comprised of a loss of $10.3 million related to the sale of our logo and emblematic general merchandise inventory below cost to FLC and an inventory write-off of $4.7 million related to our initiative to exit certain product offerings and streamline/rationalize our overall non-logo general merchandise product assortment resulting from the centralization of our merchandising decision-making during the year, partially offset by higher contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts (130 basis points) resulting from contract renewals and new store contracts.\n\u2022Rental gross margin decreased (670 basis points), driven primarily by higher contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts (620 basis points) and unfavorable rental mix (80 basis points), partially offset by higher rental margin rates (30 basis points).\nWholesale\nThe cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $131.1 million, or 79.1% of sales, and $34.7 million, or 20.9% of sales, respectively, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $158.5 million, or 79.9% of sales, and $39.8 million, or 20.1% of sales, respectively, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The gross margin increased to 20.9% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from 20.1% during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of returns and allowances and lower markdowns, partially offset by an unfavorable sales mix.\nDSS\nGross margin for the DSS segment was $22.3 million, or 81.5% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and $19.3 million, or 81.6% of sales, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher bartleby subscription sales.\nIntercompany Eliminations\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, sales eliminations were $89.8 million and $83.9 million, respectively. These sales eliminations represent the elimination of Wholesale sales and fulfillment service fees to Retail and the elimination of Retail commissions earned from Wholesale.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, the cost of sales eliminations were $89.8 million and $84.0 million, respectively. These cost of sales eliminations represent (i) the recognition of intercompany profit for Retail inventory that was purchased from Wholesale in a prior period that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period and the elimination of Wholesale service fees charged for fulfillment of inventory for virtual store sales, net of (ii) the elimination of intercompany profit for Wholesale inventory purchases by Retail that remain in ending inventory at the end of the current period.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nThe $0.1 million of gross margin elimination reflects the net impact of the sales eliminations and cost of sales eliminations during both the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, respectively.

The variances by segment are as follows:\nRetail\nFor Retail, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $69.7 million, or 20.0%, to $278.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $347.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a $59.3 million decrease in stores payroll and operating expenses, including comparable stores, primarily due to temporary furloughed store employees, lower virtual stores and new/closed stores payroll and operating expenses, and a decrease of $10.4 million in corporate payroll, infrastructure costs, product development costs and digital operations costs.\nWholesale\nFor Wholesale, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $2.1 million, or 11.8%, to $16.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $18.2 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower payroll and operating costs.\nDSS\nFor DSS, selling and administrative expenses increased by $2.9 million to $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $19.2 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase in costs was primarily driven by an increase in payroll costs, higher professional services and advertising costs.\nCorporate Services\nCorporate Services' selling and administrative expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 13.8%, to $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $19.4 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.

The decrease was primarily attributable to lower depreciable assets and intangibles due to the store impairment loss recognized during the third quarter of Fiscal 2021. See impairment loss discuss below.\nImpairment loss (non-cash)\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.

The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, among other provisions. In accordance with SAB 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (SAB 118), we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act within the provisional period as of April 27, 2019. We recorded measurement period adjustments during Fiscal 2019 to reduce our net deferred tax liability by $3.9 million, which primarily relates to the acceleration of certain deductions as permitted by the U.S. tax code. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was a $20.4 million reduction of the value of our net deferred (which represents future tax liabilities) and long-term tax liabilities as a result of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was recorded in Fiscal 2018. We also recorded a liability associated with the one-time transition tax. This amount is not material.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (The CARES Act\u201d) was enacted. We have analyzed the provisions, which provide for a technical correction to allow for full expensing of qualified leasehold improvements, modifications to charitable contribution and net operating loss limitations ( NOLs\u201d), modifications to the deductibility of business interest expense, as well as Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit acceleration. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was an income tax benefit of $7.2 million for the carryback of NOLs to higher tax rate years, recorded in Fiscal 2021. As of May 1, 2021, we recognized a current income tax receivable for NOL carrybacks of $30.5 million in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nNet Loss\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended\nMay 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>53 weeks ended\nMay 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Restated (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(139,810) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(38,250) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, we reported a net loss of $(139.8) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, compared with a net loss of $(38.3) million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) is $() million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, compared with $(21.1) million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. See Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) discussion below.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow\nTo supplement our results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we use the measure of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) regulations. We define Adjusted Earnings as net income adjusted for certain reconciling items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) interest expense and (3) income taxes, (4) as adjusted for items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss). We define Free Cash Flow as Cash Flows from Operating Activities less capital expenditures, cash interest and cash taxes.\nTo properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings to net income (loss), the reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss), and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to net income (loss) by segment, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, set forth in the tables below. All of the items included in the reconciliations below are either (i) non-cash items or (ii) items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as substitutes for and should not be considered superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our use of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly named measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nWe review these non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures to evaluate our performance at a consolidated level and at a segment level and manage our operations. We believe that these measures are useful performance measures which are used by us to facilitate a comparison of our on-going operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone, as they exclude certain items that management believes do not reflect the ordinary performance of our operations in a particular period. Our Board of Directors and management also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, at a consolidated and at a segment level, as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting expected performance, for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a measure for performance incentive plans. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to determine segment capital allocations. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment results provides investors useful and important information regarding our operating results, in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements and assists investors in their understanding of our operating profitability and liquidity as we manage the business to maximize margin and cash flow.\nConsolidated Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP)\nTable 44: <table><tr><td> </td>

The following table provides the components of total purchases of property and equipment:\nCapital Expenditures\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended\nApril 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended\nMay 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>53 weeks ended\nMay 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Physical store capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,926 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product and system development </td> <td> </td> <td>15,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,710 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Content development costs </td> <td> </td> <td>9,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>2,534 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,221 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Capital Expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our credit agreement and short-term vendor financing. As of April 30, 2022, we had $225.7 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Financing Arrangements discussion below.\nWe believe that our future cash from operations, access to borrowings under the Credit Facility, FILO Facility and short-term financings will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the economy and the outlook for and pace of sustainable growth in our markets, the levels at which we maintain inventory, the number and timing of new store openings, and any potential acquisitions of other brands or companies including digital properties. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing of debt or equity. Our access to, and the availability of, financing in the future will be impacted by many factors, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that we will have access to capital markets on acceptable terms.\nCOVID-19 Business Impact\nDuring Fiscal 2022, our business continued to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. We cannot accurately predict the duration or extent of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, including variants, on enrollments, campus activities, university budgets, athletics and other areas that directly affect our business operations. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings, and its effect on our ability to source products, including textbooks and general merchandise offerings.\nAs we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales later into the quarter or shifting some sales to our fourth quarter. We will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nour campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. Please see our Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview for further discussion.\nWe will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and our campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management or market factors currently in place change, there could be a further impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nSources and Uses of Cash Flow\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at beginning of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,768 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>2,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,676) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(42,661) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,888) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(37,019) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>45,721 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash at end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,008 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we had restricted cash of $11.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively, comprised of $10.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet related to segregated funds for commission due to FLC for logo merchandise sales as per the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and $0.9 million as of the end of both periods in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet related to amounts held in trust for future distributions related to employee benefit plans.\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nOur business is highly seasonal. For our retail operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and third fiscal quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks and other course materials for the upcoming semesters based on the typical academic semester. When a school adopts our First Day inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the student drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. For our wholesale operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, as payments are received from the summer and winter selling season when they sell textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. For both retail and wholesale, cash flows from operating activities are typically a use of cash in the fourth fiscal quarter, when sales volumes are materially lower than the other quarters. For our DSS segment, cash flows are not seasonal as cash flows from operating activities are typically consistent throughout the year. Our quarterly cash flows also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various school's semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods.\nCash flows provided by operating activities during Fiscal 2022 were $2.1 million compared to $32.9 million during Fiscal 2021. This decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $30.8 million was primarily due to $41.8 million of proceeds received in Fiscal 2021 for the sale of logo merchandise inventory to FLC and changes in working capital, including higher accounts receivables outstanding and higher inventory purchases, partially offset by improved earnings in the current year period compared to the prior year period and lower tax payments of $14.0 million compared to the prior year period. Our operations were highly impacted by COVID-19 related campus store closures in the prior year period, resulting in lower operating costs and lower inventory purchases in the prior year.\nCash flows provided by operating activities during Fiscal 2021 were $32.9 million compared to cash flow used in operating activities of $(8.7) million during Fiscal 2020. This increase in cash provided by operating activities of $41.6 million was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of logo merchandise inventory to FLC of $41.8 million, partially offset by lower net income, an increase in other long-term liabilities due to sale of treasury shares at a premium (discussed above), and changes in working capital. As discussed above, our operations were highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiscal 2021.\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities during Fiscal 2022 were $(42.7) million compared to $(36.9) million during Fiscal 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher capital expenditures and contractual capital investments associated with content development, digital initiatives, enhancements to internal systems and websites, renewing\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nexisting contracts and new store construction. Capital expenditures totaled $(43.5) million and $(37.2) million during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively.\nCash flows used in investing activities during Fiscal 2021 were $(36.9) million compared to $(37.0) million during Fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities is primarily for capital expenditures and contractual capital investments associated with content development, digital initiatives, enhancements to internal systems and websites, renewing existing contracts and new store construction and lower payments to acquire businesses and the change in other noncurrent assets for contractual obligations. Capital expenditures totaled $37.2 million and $36.2 million during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash flows provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2022 were $45.7 million compared to $11.8 million during Fiscal 2021. The net change of $33.9 million is primarily due to higher net borrowings under the credit agreement, offset by proceeds from the sale of treasury shares of $10.9 million during Fiscal 2021.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2021 were $11.8 million compared to $39.9 million during Fiscal 2020. This net change of $28.1 million is primarily due to higher net borrowings under the credit agreement and the sale of treasury shares of $10.9 million (discussed above), partially offset by the payment of deferred financing costs of $1.1 million.\nFinancing Arrangements\nWe have a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), amended March 31, 2021 and March 1, 2019, under which the lenders committed to provide us with a five-year asset-backed revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed principal amount of $400 million (the Credit Facility\u201d). We have the option to request an increase in commitments under the Credit Facility of up to $100 million, subject to certain restrictions. Proceeds from the Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes, including seasonal working capital needs. The agreement includes an incremental first in, last out seasonal loan facility (the FILO Facility\u201d) for a $100 million incremental facility maintaining the maximum availability under the Credit Agreement at $500 million.\nOn March 4, 2022, we were granted a waiver to the condition to the upcoming draw under the FILO Facility, scheduled for April 2022, that Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) minus Restricted Payments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) equal at least $110.0 million. Under the waiver amendment, the commitment under the FILO Facility of $25.0 million was increased to $40.0 million, with all remaining terms unchanged.\nOn June 7, 2022, subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2022, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement with TopLids LendCo, LLC and Vital Fundco, LLC and we entered an amendment to the Credit Agreement. Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16. Subsequent Event for details.\nOn June 28, 2022, we obtained limited waivers with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the requisite lenders thereunder waived any potential default or event of default under such agreements solely to the extent arising from the restatement of Fiscal 2021 consolidated financial statements as described in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, we borrowed $632.2 million and repaid $584.1 million under the Credit Agreement, with $225.7 million of outstanding borrowings as of April 30, 2022. During the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we borrowed $722.6 million and repaid $719.7 million under the Credit Agreement, with $177.6 million of outstanding borrowings as of May 1, 2021. During the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, we borrowed $600.9 million and repaid $559.7 million under the Credit Agreement, with $174.7 million of outstanding borrowings as of May 2, 2020. As of both April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we have issued $4.8 million in letters of credit under the Credit Facility.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we incurred debt issuance costs totaling $0.3 million and $1.1 million related to the March 4, 2022 waiver and March 31, 2021 Credit Facility amendment. The debt issuance costs have been deferred and are presented as prepaid and other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the credit agreement.\nThe Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the inventory, accounts receivable and related assets of the borrowers under the Credit Facility. This is considered an all asset lien (inclusive of proceeds from tax refunds payable to the Company and a pledge of equity from subsidiaries, exclusive of real estate).\nInterest under the Credit Facility accrues, at our election, at a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") or alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin, which is determined by reference to the level of excess availability under the Credit Facility. Loans will initially bear interest at SOFR plus 2.00% per annum, in the case of SOFR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum, in the alternative, and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between SOFR plus 2.00% per annum and SOFR plus 1.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 1.000% per\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nannum and the alternate base rate plus 0.50% per annum), based upon the excess availability under the Credit Facility at such time.\nLoans under the FILO Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the SOFR rate, plus 3.750%. In connection with the waiver, the applicable margin for credit extensions made under the FILO Facility after March 31, 2021 through the end of 2021 was increased by 0.50% (to 3.75% per annum for SOFR rate loans and 2.75% for base rate loans). The FILO Facility will be available solely during the draw period each year, from April 1 through July 31. We are required to borrow 100% of the aggregate commitments under the FILO Facility on April 1 of each year, and the loans must be repaid in full (including interest and fees) on July 31 of each year. The commitments under the FILO Facility decreased from $50.0 million to $25.0 million on August 1, 2021. We will pay a commitment fee of 0.375% on the daily unused portion of the FILO Facility.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary negative covenants, which limit the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, make restricted payments or specified payments and merge or acquire assets, among other things. In addition, if excess availability under the Credit Facility were to fall below certain specified levels, certain additional covenants (including fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and a minimum excess availability of the greater of 10% of the Loan Cap and $25.0 million when the FILO is funded) would be triggered, and the lenders would have the right to assume dominion and control over the Company's cash. The Credit Facility includes an anti-cash hoarding provision, which limits maximum excess cash allowed to $50.0 million when the FILO is funded.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, material breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, default on other material indebtedness, customary ERISA events of default, bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, invalidity of liens on collateral, change of control or cessation of business. The Credit Facility also contains customary affirmative covenants and representations and warranties. We are in compliance with all covenants, representations and warranties under the Credit Facility as of April 30, 2022.\nIncome Tax Implications on Liquidity\nFor the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, the Company intends to file an application to change its tax year from January to April under the automatic consent provisions. As a result of the tax year-end change, there is no longer a long-term tax payable associated with the LIFO reserve in other long-term liabilities.\nWe have filed our federal income tax returns for the tax year ended January 2021, as well claims for refunds for cash taxes paid in prior years. We received a $7.8 million refund in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 and expect to receive additional refunds of approximately $22.6 million.\nShare Repurchases\nOn December 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $50 million, in the aggregate, of our outstanding common stock. The stock repurchase program is carried out at the direction of management (which may include a plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The stock repurchase program may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time. Any repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and will be available for general corporate purposes. During Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, we did not purchase shares under the stock repurchase program. As of April 30, 2022, approximately $26.7 million remains available under the stock repurchase program.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, we also repurchased 239,751 shares, 414,174 shares, and 374,733 shares of our common stock, respectively, in connection with employee tax withholding obligations for vested stock awards.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations (in millions):\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Facility (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>185.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FILO Facility (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term Loans (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease obligations (excluding imputed interest) (b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>367.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (c)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>22.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under GAAP (d)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>645.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>342.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>144.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)As of April 30, 2022, we had a total of $225.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and FILO Facility. See Financing Arrangements discussion above for information about future borrowings and payments under the FILO Credit Facility. On June 7, 2022, subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2022, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement and we entered an amendment to the Credit Agreement. Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 16. Subsequent Event for details.\n(b)Our contracts for physical bookstores with colleges and universities are typically five years with renewal options, but can range from one to 15 years, and are typically cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. Annual projections are based on current minimum guarantee amounts. In approximately 50% of our contracts with colleges and universities that include minimum guarantees, the minimum guaranteed amounts adjust annually to equal less than the prior year's commission earned. Excludes obligations under store leases for property insurance and real estate taxes, which totaled approximately 2.4% of the minimum rent payments under those leases.\n(c)Includes information technology contracts.\n(d)Other long-term liabilities excludes expected payments related to employee benefit plans. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans.\nCertain Relationships and Related Party Transactions\nSee Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10. Related Party Transactions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments with respect to certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nProduct sales and rentals\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of products through our bookstore locations, including virtual bookstores, and our bookstore affiliated e-commerce websites, and contains a single performance obligation. Revenue from sales of our products is recognized at the point in time when control of the products is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for the products. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 3. Revenue.\nRetail product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of our products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of our products by our customers for products ordered through our websites and virtual bookstores. Wholesale product revenue is recognized upon shipment of physical textbooks at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. Additional revenue is recognized for shipping charges billed to customers and shipping costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs within cost of goods sold.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nRevenue from the rental of physical textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is deferred and recognized over the rental period based on the passage of time commencing at the point of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer. Rental periods are typically for a single semester and are always less than one year in duration. We offer a buyout option to allow the purchase of a rented physical textbook at the end of the rental period if the customer desires to do so. We record the buyout purchase when the customer exercises and pays the buyout option price which is determined at the time of the buyout. In these instances, we accelerate any remaining deferred rental revenue at the point of sale.\nRevenue from the rental of digital textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is recognized at the point of sale. A software feature is embedded within the content of our digital textbooks, such that upon expiration of the rental term the customer is no longer able to access the content. While the digital rental allows the customer to access digital content for a fixed period of time, once the digital content is delivered to the customer, our performance obligation is complete.\nWe estimate returns based on an analysis of historical experience. A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is provided through a reduction of sales and cost of goods sold in the period that the related sales are recorded.\nFor sales and rentals involving third-party products, we evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent. Our determination is based on our evaluation of whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. For those transactions where we are the principal, we record revenue on a gross basis, and for those transactions where we are an agent to a third-party, we record revenue on a net basis. Effective April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales to FLC and Fanatics. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our condensed consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021.\nWe do not have gift card or customer loyalty programs. We do not treat any promotional offers as expenses. Sales tax collected from our customers is excluded from reported revenues. Our payment terms are generally 30 days and do not extend beyond one year.\nService and other revenue\nService and other revenue is primarily derived from DSS segment subscription-based service revenues and partnership marketing services which includes promotional activities and advertisements within our physical bookstores and web properties performed on behalf of third-party customers.\nSubscription-based revenue, which contains a single performance obligation, is deferred and recognized based on the passage of time over the subscription period commencing at the point of sale, when control of the service transfers to the customer. The majority of subscriptions sold are one month in duration.\nPartnership marketing agreements often include multiple performance obligations which are individually negotiated with our customers. For these arrangements that contain distinct performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price method by comparing the standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. The revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied, typically at a point in time for partnership marketing service and overtime for advertising efforts as measured based upon the passage of time for contracts that are based on a stated period of time or the number of impressions delivered for contracts with a fixed number of impressions.\nMerchandise Inventories\nMerchandise inventories, which consist of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market value of our inventory, which is all purchased finished goods, is determined based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation.\nCost is determined primarily by the retail inventory method for our Retail Segment and last-in first out, or LIFO\u201d, method for our Wholesale Segment. Our textbook inventories, for Retail and Wholesale, and trade book inventories are valued using the LIFO method and the related reserve was not material to the recorded amount of our inventories. There were no LIFO adjustments in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020.\nReserves for non-returnable inventory are based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory. Reserve calculations are sensitive to certain significant assumptions, including markdowns, sales below cost, inventory aging and expected demand. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the non-returnable inventory reserve. However, if assumptions based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nin actual non-returnable inventory would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $5.6 million in Fiscal 2022.\nFor our physical bookstores, we also estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date. Shortage rates are estimated and accrued based on historical rates and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate shortage rates. However, if our estimates regarding shortage rates are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10 basis point change in actual shortage rates would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $0.05 million in Fiscal 2022.\nTextbook Rental Inventories\nPhysical textbooks out on rent are categorized as textbook rental inventories. At the time a rental transaction is consummated, the book is removed from merchandise inventories and moved to textbook rental inventories at cost. The cost of the book is amortized down to its estimated residual value over the rental period. The related amortization expense is included in cost of goods sold. At the end of the rental period, upon return, the book is removed from textbook rental inventories and recorded in merchandise inventories at its amortized cost. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate rental cost of goods sold. However, if our estimates regarding residual value are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 1% change in rental cost of goods sold would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $0.4 million in Fiscal 2022.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of long-term incentive compensation payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12. Long-Term Incentive Compensation Expense for a further discussion of our stock-based incentive plan.\nWe are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate, and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If their actual forfeiture rate is materially different from their estimate, our long-term incentive compensation expense could be significantly different from what we recorded in the current period. For stock options granted with an \"at market\" exercise price, we determined the grant fair value using the Black-Scholes model and for stock options granted with \"a premium\" exercise price, we determined the grant date fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value models for stock options use assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected term of the options.\nPhantom shares will be settled in cash based on the fair market value of a share of common stock at each vesting date in an amount not to exceed a specific price per share. The fair value of the phantom shares was determined using the closing stock price on the date of the award less the fair value of the call option which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the liability for the cash-settled phantom share unit awards will be remeasured at the end of each reporting period through settlement to reflect current risk-free rate and volatility assumptions.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine long-term incentive compensation expense. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the long-term incentive compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the long-term incentive compensation. A 10% change in our long-term incentive compensation expense would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.1 million in Fiscal 2022.\nEvaluation of Other Long-Lived Assets Impairment\nAs of April 30, 2022, our other long-lived assets include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets of $94.1 million, $286.6 million, $129.6 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and consider market participants in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the long-lived assets of the reporting units for impairment at the lowest asset group level for which individual cash flows can be identified. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compared the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the assets to the fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows. If required, an impairment loss is recorded for that portion of the asset's carrying value in excess of fair value.\nOur business has been significantly negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many schools continued to adjust their learning models and on-campus activities. Many of the trends observed during the Fall 2021 semester continued into the Spring 2022 semester, as fewer students have returned to campus for the Spring semester. As we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nvariant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales. These combined events continue to impact the Company's course materials and general merchandise business.\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2022, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $6.4 million (both pre-tax and after-tax), comprised of $0.7 million, $1.8 million, $3.7 million and $0.2 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively, on the consolidated statement of operations.\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2021, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $27.6 million, $20.5 million after-tax, comprised of $5.1 million, $13.3 million, $6.3 million and $2.9 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively,\nThe fair value of the impaired long-lived assets were determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), using the Company's best estimates of the amount and timing of future discounted cash flows, based on historical experience, market conditions, current trends and performance expectations. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, we recorded an impairment loss (non-cash) of $0.4 million in the Retail segment related to net capitalized development costs for a project which are not recoverable. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, in conjunction with COVID-19 related campus store closures, we evaluated certain of our long-lived assets associated with our Retail and Wholesale segments for impairment. Based on the results of the tests, for the Retail segment, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.6 million related to store-level assets in restructuring and other charges. These long-lived assets were not recoverable and had a de minimis fair value, as determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), resulting in a non-cash impairment charge for the full carrying value of those long-lived assets.\nThe impairment analysis process requires significant estimation to determine recoverability of each asset group and to determine the fair value of asset groups that were not recoverable, as well as the fair values of certain operating right-of-use assets included within the asset groups that were not recoverable. The significant assumptions used included annual revenue growth rates, gross margin rates and the estimated relationship of selling and administrative costs to revenue used to estimate the projected cash-flow directly related to the future operation of the stores as well as the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate the fair value. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair values of certain operating right-of-use assets included the current market rent and discount rate. These assumptions are subjective in nature and are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic).\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% decrease in our estimated discounted cash flows would not have materially affected the results of our operations in Fiscal 2022.\nEvaluation of Goodwill Impairment\nThe costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired are carried as goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with ASC 350-10, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we complete our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the third quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of both May 1, 2021 and May 2, 2020, we had $0, $0 and $4,700 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets related to our Retail, Wholesale, and DSS reporting units, respectively.\nDuring the third quarter of both Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that the fair value of the DSS reporting unit was determined to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit; therefore, no goodwill impairment was recognized.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In performing the valuation, we used cash flows that reflected management's forecasts and discount rates that included risk adjustments consistent with the current market conditions.\nWe estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach for our annual impairment testing and using the income approach for our interim impairment test. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nresults, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital and tax rates. We also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions, interest rates, market data, and other observable trends, such as comparable store sales trends, recent changes in publisher relationships, and development of innovative digital products and services in the rapidly changing education landscape. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of cash flows and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit and considering a reasonable control premium.\nMany of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value, and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment. The following assumptions are significant to our evaluation process:\nBusiness Projections- We make assumptions about the level of revenues, gross profit, operating expenses, as well as capital expenditures and net working capital requirements. These assumptions drive our planning assumptions and represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections. These projections are developed using our internal business plans over a five-year planning period that are updated at least annually;\nLong-term Growth Rates- We also utilize an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which our cash flow stream is projected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value and are added to the cash flows projected during our five-year planning period; and\nDiscount Rates- The estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded.\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates.", "item_7_truncated": "During the third quarter of both Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, we completed our annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that the fair value of the DSS reporting unit was determined to exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit; therefore, no goodwill impairment was recognized.\nThe cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $131.1 million, or 79.1% of sales, and $34.7 million, or 20.9% of sales, respectively, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $158.5 million, or 79.9% of sales, and $39.8 million, or 20.1% of sales, respectively, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The gross margin increased to 20.9% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from 20.1% during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of returns and allowances and lower markdowns, partially offset by an unfavorable sales mix.\n(d) Earnings are adjusted for amortization expense (non-cash) related to content development costs which are included in cost of goods sold.\nTable 35: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable Store Sales variances for Retail (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in millions </td> <td> </td> <td>May 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Textbooks (Course Materials) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(158.4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General Merchandise </td> <td> </td> <td>(235.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(45.9) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Trade Books </td> <td> </td> <td>(20.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Comparable Store Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(414.6) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26.1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nElements of Results of Operations\nannum and the alternate base rate plus 0.50% per annum), based upon the excess availability under the Credit Facility at such time.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.

The decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of returns and allowances and higher markdowns, partially offset by a favorable sales mix.\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended </td> <td> </td> <td>53 weeks ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>May 1,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nSales </td> <td> </td> <td>May 2,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nSales </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and Administrative Expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.6% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>404,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n(e) Represents the income tax effects of the non-GAAP items.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended\nApril 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended\nMay 1, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>53 weeks ended\nMay 2, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash flows provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,060 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,676) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures (a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>43,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,223 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,192 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash interest </td> <td> </td> <td>8,166 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,796 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,007) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,141) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Free Cash Flow (non-GAAP) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(41,632) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,114) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(47,523) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the Retail cost of sales:\nUnless the context otherwise indicates, references to we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. or BNED\u201d, a Delaware corporation.

Our determination is based on our evaluation of whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. For those transactions where we are the principal, we record revenue on a gross basis, and for those transactions where we are an agent to a third-party, we record revenue on a net basis. Effective April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales to FLC and Fanatics. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our condensed consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021.\nFinancing Arrangements\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 weeks ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dollars in thousands </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 1, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Restated (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(68,857) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(139,810) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the inventory, accounts receivable and related assets of the borrowers under the Credit Facility.

Product and other sales are impacted by comparable store sales (as noted in the chart below), new store openings and store closings, as well as the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales were impacted by the temporary store closings due to COVID-19 earlier in the fiscal year, as well as the impact of fewer students returning to campus, as many schools implemented a remote learning model and curtailed on-campus classes and activities. While many big-conferences resumed their sport activities, fan attendance at the games was either eliminated or severely restricted, which further impacted the company's high-margin general merchandise business.

We present this metric as additional useful information about the Company's operational and financial performance and to allow greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for operating and financial decision-making. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry and the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Fiscal 2022\u201d means the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Fiscal 2021\u201d means the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, and Fiscal 2020\u201d means the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.\n\nDuring both 52 weeks periods ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, the gross margin eliminations was $0.1 million. The gross margin eliminations reflect the net impact of the sales eliminations and cost of sales eliminations during the above mentioned reporting periods.\n(c) Other includes inventory liquidation sales to third parties, marketplace sales and certain accounting adjusting items related to return reserves, and other deferred items.\nWe are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate, and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If their actual forfeiture rate is materially different from their estimate, our long-term incentive compensation expense could be significantly different from what we recorded in the current period. For stock options granted with an \"at market\" exercise price, we determined the grant fair value using the Black-Scholes model and for stock options granted with \"a premium\" exercise price, we determined the grant date fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value models for stock options use assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected term of the options.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $8.9 million, or 14.4%, to $53.0 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $61.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower depreciable assets and intangibles due to the store impairment loss recognized during the third quarter of Fiscal 2021. See impairment loss discuss below.\nDSS\n(d)Other long-term liabilities excludes expected payments related to employee benefit plans. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans.\nFor our physical bookstores, we also estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date. Shortage rates are estimated and accrued based on historical rates and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate shortage rates. However, if our estimates regarding shortage rates are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10 basis point change in actual shortage rates would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $0.05 million in Fiscal 2022.\n\nIn December 2020, we entered into the FLC Partnership. Through this partnership, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our general merchandise business. Fanatics' cutting-edge e-commerce and technology expertise offers our campus stores expanded product selection, a world-class online and mobile experience, and a progressive direct-to-consumer platform. Coupled with Lids (FLC's parent company), the leading standalone brick and mortar retailer focused exclusively on licensed fan and alumni products, our campus stores have improved access to trend and sales performance data on licensees, product styles, and design treatments.\nvariant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales. These combined events continue to impact the Company's course materials and general merchandise business.\n\n(b) In Fiscal 2022, 2021 and Fiscal 2020, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Retail Gross Comparable Store course material sales increased by 2.3%, as compared to a 15.2% decline a year ago, when the majority of our stores had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below. The increase in course material sales was reflective of the growth of First Day inclusive access programs, digital and eTextbook revenue increases, due to a shift to lower cost options and more affordable solutions, including digital offerings. For the 2022 Spring term, First Day Complete was offered through 76 campus bookstores compared to 14 campus bookstores in the prior year, at schools with over 380,000 in total undergraduate enrollment, up from approximately 62,000 in total undergraduate enrollment in the 2021 Spring term. Revenue for both of our First Day models increased to $234.2 million during Fiscal 2022, as compared to $122.7 million in the prior year period.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, we also repurchased 239,751 shares, 414,174 shares, and 374,733 shares of our common stock, respectively, in connection with employee tax withholding obligations for vested stock awards.\n(c) See Management Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations discussion above.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nAs we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales later into the quarter or shifting some sales to our fourth quarter. We will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and our campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management or market factors currently in place change, there could be a further impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nFor Wholesale, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.5%, to $16.0 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $16.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower compensation expense and lower operating costs.\nNet Loss\nCorporate Services\nCash flows used in investing activities during Fiscal 2021 were $(36.9) million compared to $(37.0) million during Fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities is primarily for capital expenditures and contractual capital investments associated with content development, digital initiatives, enhancements to internal systems and websites, renewing existing contracts and new store construction and lower payments to acquire businesses and the change in other noncurrent assets for contractual obligations. Capital expenditures totaled $37.2 million and $36.2 million during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.\nGross margin for the DSS segment was $29.9 million, or 83.9% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and $22.3 million, or 81.5% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The gross margins are driven primarily by high margin subscription service revenue earned.\nRetail product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of our products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of our products by our customers for products ordered through our websites and virtual bookstores. Wholesale product revenue is recognized upon shipment of physical textbooks at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. Additional revenue is recognized for shipping charges billed to customers and shipping costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs within cost of goods sold.\nCash flows provided by operating activities during Fiscal 2022 were $2.1 million compared to $32.9 million during Fiscal 2021. This decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $30.8 million was primarily due to $41.8 million of proceeds received in Fiscal 2021 for the sale of logo merchandise inventory to FLC and changes in working capital, including higher accounts receivables outstanding and higher inventory purchases, partially offset by improved earnings in the current year period compared to the prior year period and lower tax payments of $14.0 million compared to the prior year period. Our operations were highly impacted by COVID-19 related campus store closures in the prior year period, resulting in lower operating costs and lower inventory purchases in the prior year.\nThe impairment analysis process requires significant estimation to determine recoverability of each asset group and to determine the fair value of asset groups that were not recoverable, as well as the fair values of certain operating right-of-use assets included within the asset groups that were not recoverable. The significant assumptions used included annual revenue growth rates, gross margin rates and the estimated relationship of selling and administrative costs to revenue used to estimate the projected cash-flow directly related to the future operation of the stores as well as the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate the fair value. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair values of certain operating right-of-use assets included the current market rent and discount rate. These assumptions are subjective in nature and are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic).\nWholesale sales decreased by $53.6 million, or 32.3%, to $112.2 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $165.8 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to lower gross sales impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply constraints resulting from the lack of on campus textbook buyback opportunities during the prior fiscal year, a decrease in customer demand resulting from a shift in buying patterns from physical textbooks to digital products, and lower demand from other third-party clients, partially offset by lower returns and allowances. During the prior year period, the Wholesale operations assumed direct-to-student fulfillment of course material orders for the Retail Segment campus bookstores that were not fully operational due to COVID-19 campus store closures, whereas the sales shifted back to the physical bookstores in the current period.\nOn June 28, 2022, we obtained limited waivers with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the requisite lenders thereunder waived any potential default or event of default under such agreements solely to the extent arising from the restatement of Fiscal 2021 consolidated financial statements as described in Part II - Item 8.

The variances by segment are discussed by segment below. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In performing the valuation, we used cash flows that reflected management's forecasts and discount rates that included risk adjustments consistent with the current market conditions.\nRetail total sales increased by $109.2 million, or 8.2%, to $1,439.7 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $1,330.5 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.

Loans will initially bear interest at SOFR plus 2.00% per annum, in the case of SOFR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum, in the alternative, and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between SOFR plus 2.00% per annum and SOFR plus 1.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 1.000% per\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we recognized restructuring and other charges totaling $10.7 million (Restated), comprised primarily of $6.6 million for severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives, $5.7 million for professional service costs related to restructuring, process improvements, the financial advisor strategic review process, costs related to development and integration associated with Fanatics and FLC partnership agreements and shareholder activist activities, and liabilities for a facility closure, partially offset by a $1.6 million in an actuarial gain related to a frozen retirement benefit plan (non-cash).\nRevenue from the rental of physical textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is deferred and recognized over the rental period based on the passage of time commencing at the point of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer. Rental periods are typically for a single semester and are always less than one year in duration. We offer a buyout option to allow the purchase of a rented physical textbook at the end of the rental period if the customer desires to do so. We record the buyout purchase when the customer exercises and pays the buyout option price which is determined at the time of the buyout. In these instances, we accelerate any remaining deferred rental revenue at the point of sale.\n(c) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nDescription of business\nWe have three reportable segments: Retail, Wholesale and DSS. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, continue to be presented as Corporate Services\u201d. The following discussion provides information regarding the three segments.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary negative covenants, which limit the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, make restricted payments or specified payments and merge or acquire assets, among other things. In addition, if excess availability under the Credit Facility were to fall below certain specified levels, certain additional covenants (including fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and a minimum excess availability of the greater of 10% of the Loan Cap and $25.0 million when the FILO is funded) would be triggered, and the lenders would have the right to assume dominion and control over the Company's cash. The Credit Facility includes an anti-cash hoarding provision, which limits maximum excess cash allowed to $50.0 million when the FILO is funded.\n\nOur cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales to 75.7% during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared to 82.4% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Our gross margin increased by $120.1 million, or 47.5%, to $372.8 million, or 24.3% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $252.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, we borrowed $632.2 million and repaid $584.1 million under the Credit Agreement, with $225.7 million of outstanding borrowings as of April 30, 2022. During the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we borrowed $722.6 million and repaid $719.7 million under the Credit Agreement, with $177.6 million of outstanding borrowings as of May 1, 2021. During the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, we borrowed $600.9 million and repaid $559.7 million under the Credit Agreement, with $174.7 million of outstanding borrowings as of May 2, 2020. As of both April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we have issued $4.8 million in letters of credit under the Credit Facility.\nOur sales are primarily derived from the sale of course materials, which include new, used and digital textbooks, and at college and university bookstores which we operate, we sell high margin general merchandise, including emblematic apparel and gifts, trade books, computer products, school and dorm supplies, convenience and caf\u00e9 items and graduation products. Our rental income is primarily derived from the rental of physical textbooks. We also derive revenue from other sources, such as sales of inventory management, hardware and point-of-sale software, direct-to-student subscription-based services, and other services.\nWhile our campus stores were closed, we continued to serve institutions and students through our campus websites, providing free shipping on all orders and an expanded digital content offering to provide immediate access to course materials to students at our campuses that closed due to COVID-19. We developed and implemented plans to safely reopen our campus stores based on national, state and local guidelines, as well as the campus policies set by the school administration.\nService and other revenue\nDuring the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $0.4 million in the Retail segment related to net capitalized development costs for a project which are not recoverable.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nEffective April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales to FLC and Fanatics. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021.\n\nWe estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach for our annual impairment testing and using the income approach for our interim impairment test. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating\nWe maintain our relationships with campus partners and remain responsible for staffing and managing the day-to-day operations of our campus bookstores. We also work closely with our campus partners to ensure that each campus store maintains unique aspects of in-store merchandising, including localized product assortments and specific styles and designs that reflect each campus's brand. We leverage Fanatics' e-commerce technology and expertise for the operational management of the emblematic merchandise and gift sections of our campus store websites. FLC manages in-store assortment planning and merchandising of emblematic apparel, headwear, and gift products for our partner campus stores.\nOur selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of store payroll and store operating expenses. Selling and administrative expenses also include long-term incentive plan compensation expense and general office expenses, such as merchandising, procurement, field support, finance and accounting, and operating costs related to our direct-to-student subscription-based services business. Shared-service costs such as human resources, legal, treasury, information technology, and various other corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are not allocated to any specific reporting segment and are recorded in Corporate Services as discussed in the Overview - Segments discussion above.\nThe $0.1 million of gross margin elimination reflects the net impact of the sales eliminations and cost of sales eliminations during both the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, respectively. The gross margin eliminations reflect the net impact of the sales eliminations and cost of sales eliminations during the above mentioned reporting periods.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nOur Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 results have been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many schools continued to adjust their learning model and on-campus activities in response to the pandemic.

These cost of sales eliminations represent (i) the recognition of intercompany profit for Retail inventory that was purchased from Wholesale in a prior period that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period and the elimination of Wholesale service fees charged for fulfillment of inventory for virtual store sales, net of (ii) the elimination of intercompany profit for Wholesale inventory purchases by Retail that remain in ending inventory at the end of the current period.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nOur business has been significantly negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many schools continued to adjust their learning models and on-campus activities. Many of the trends observed during the Fall 2021 semester continued into the Spring 2022 semester, as fewer students have returned to campus for the Spring semester. As we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nOur total sales increased by $97.5 million, or 6.8%, to $1,531.4 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $1,433.9 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The sales increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. The increase is offset by the negative impact on sales primarily due to lower enrollments, primarily at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings and lower logo and emblematic sales as they are reflected in sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021. For additional information, see Retail Sales discussion below.\n\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $(8.7) million on a pre-tax loss of $(77.5) million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, which represented an effective income tax rate of 11.2% and an income tax benefit of $(45.2) million on a pre-tax loss of $(185.0) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, which represented an effective income tax rate of 24.4%.\nRetail total sales decreased by $382.4 million, or 22.3%, to $1,330.5 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $1,712.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Retail added 98 new stores and closed 100 stores (not including temporary store closings due to COVID-19) during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, ending the period with a total of 1,417 stores.\nBasis of Consolidation\n(a)We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of long-term incentive compensation payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12. Long-Term Incentive Compensation Expense for a further discussion of our stock-based incentive plan.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments with respect to certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nDiscount Rates- The estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.\n\n(c)Includes information technology contracts.\nCOVID-19 Business Impact\nNet Loss\nFor Retail, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $69.7 million, or 20.0%, to $278.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $347.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a $59.3 million decrease in stores payroll and operating expenses, including comparable stores, primarily due to temporary furloughed store employees, lower virtual stores and new/closed stores payroll and operating expenses, and a decrease of $10.4 million in corporate payroll, infrastructure costs, product development costs and digital operations costs.\nGross margin for the DSS segment was $22.3 million, or 81.5% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and $19.3 million, or 81.6% of sales, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher bartleby subscription sales.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nIntercompany Eliminations\nOur business is highly seasonal. Our quarterly results also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods. Our fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of April.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $66.2 million, or 16.4%, to $338.3 million from $404.5 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.

We have analyzed the provisions, which provide for a technical correction to allow for full expensing of qualified leasehold improvements, modifications to charitable contribution and net operating loss limitations ( NOLs\u201d), modifications to the deductibility of business interest expense, as well as Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit acceleration. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was an income tax benefit of $7.2 million for the carryback of NOLs to higher tax rate years, recorded in Fiscal 2021. As of May 1, 2021, we recognized a current income tax receivable for NOL carrybacks of $30.5 million in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOverview\nImpairment loss (non-cash)\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we recognized a merchandise inventory loss and write-off of $15.0 million in cost of goods sold in the Retail Segment discussed below. Excluding the merchandise inventory loss and write-off, cost of goods sold and gross margin was 81.3% and 18.7%, respectively, of sales during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to 76.1% and 23.9%, respectively, of sales during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Organization and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Merchandise Inventories.\nPartnership marketing agreements often include multiple performance obligations which are individually negotiated with our customers. For these arrangements that contain distinct performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price method by comparing the standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. The revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied, typically at a point in time for partnership marketing service and overtime for advertising efforts as measured based upon the passage of time for contracts that are based on a stated period of time or the number of impressions delivered for contracts with a fixed number of impressions.\nOur primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our credit agreement and short-term vendor financing. As of April 30, 2022, we had $225.7 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Financing Arrangements discussion below.\nDespite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. We cannot accurately predict the duration or extent of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, including variants, on enrollments, campus activities, university budgets, athletics and other areas that directly affect our business operations. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings, and its effect on our ability to source products, including textbooks and general merchandise offerings.\nOur operating loss was $(67.4) million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared to operating loss of $(176.9) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. This operating loss increase was due to the matters discussed above.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2021 were $11.8 million compared to $39.9 million during Fiscal 2020. This net change of $28.1 million is primarily due to higher net borrowings under the credit agreement and the sale of treasury shares of $10.9 million (discussed above), partially offset by the payment of deferred financing costs of $1.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2022, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $6.4 million (both pre-tax and after-tax), comprised of $0.7 million, $1.8 million, $3.7 million and $0.2 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively, on the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe strengths of our business include our ability to compete by developing new products and solutions to meet market needs, our large operating footprint with direct access to students and faculty, our well-established, deep relationships with academic partners and stable, long-term contracts and our well-recognized brands. We expect to continue to introduce scalable and advanced digital solutions focused largely on the student, expand our e-commerce capabilities and accelerate such capabilities through our merchandising partnership with Fanatics Retail Group Fulfillment, LLC, Inc. ( Fanatics\u201d) and Fanatics Lids College, Inc. ( FLC\u201d) (collectively referred to herein as the FLC Partnership\u201d), increase market share with new accounts, and expand our strategic opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships.\nSee Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10. Related Party Transactions.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales later into the quarter or shifting some sales to our fourth quarter. We will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and\nOur operating loss was $(176.9) million during the 53 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to operating loss of $(42.8) million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. This operating loss increase was due to the matters discussed above.\nWe believe that our future cash from operations, access to borrowings under the Credit Facility, FILO Facility and short-term financings will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the economy and the outlook for and pace of sustainable growth in our markets, the levels at which we maintain inventory, the number and timing of new store openings, and any potential acquisitions of other brands or companies including digital properties. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing of debt or equity. Our access to, and the availability of, financing in the future will be impacted by many factors, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that we will have access to capital markets on acceptable terms.\nAdditionally, Product and other sales and Rental income are impacted by the growth of First Day Complete, comparable store sales, new store openings and store closings, as well as the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales were impacted by overall enrollment declines in higher education. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall 2021 semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, and the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings. While many college athletic conferences resumed their sport activities, other on campus events, such as parent's weekends or alumni events, continue to be\nThe effective tax rate for the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 is significantly lower as compared to the prior year comparable period due to the change in pre-tax loss and the change in the assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets as compared to prior year loss carrybacks.\n(a) Represents the percentage these costs bear to the related sales, instead of total sales.\nFor the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, the Retail gross margin as a percentage of sales increased as discussed below:\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nFor DSS, selling and administrative expenses increased by $7.4 million to $29.5 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The increase in costs was primarily driven by higher compensation expense, higher operating costs invested in the business associated with product development and sales infrastructure costs aimed at increasing revenue.\nService and other revenue is primarily derived from DSS segment subscription-based service revenues and partnership marketing services which includes promotional activities and advertisements within our physical bookstores and web properties performed on behalf of third-party customers.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $6.4 million (both pre-tax and after-tax), comprised of $0.7 million, $1.8 million, $3.7 million and $0.2 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively.\n\n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\nMerchandise Inventories\nWholesale\nFor Wholesale, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $2.1 million, or 11.8%, to $16.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $18.2 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower payroll and operating costs.\nShare Repurchases\nOffering courseware sales through our inclusive access First Day and First Day Complete models is a key, and increasingly important strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students, as well as the opportunity to improve student outcomes, while, at the same time, increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross profits of courseware sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales. We expect these programs to allow us to ultimately reverse historical long-\nCorporate Services' selling and administrative expenses increased by $2.7 million, or 13.8%, to $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $19.4 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses and higher operating expenses.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $27.6 million, $20.5 million after-tax, comprised of $5.1 million, $13.3 million, $6.3 million and $2.9 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively.\n\nFor Retail, selling and administrative expenses increased by $37.0 million, or 13.3%, to $315.1 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $278.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $34.5 million increase in stores payroll and operating expenses including comparable stores, virtual stores and new/closed stores payroll and operating expenses, and a $2.5 million increase in corporate payroll, infrastructure and product development costs. The payroll increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, we recognized restructuring and other charges totaling $1.0 million, comprised primarily of $1.3 million for severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives and $1.8 million for costs associated with professional service costs for restructuring, process improvements, development and integration associated with the FLC Partnership, shareholder activist activities, and liabilities for a facility closure, partially offset by a $2.1 million in an actuarial gain related to a frozen retirement benefit plan (non-cash).\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. For information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.\nSources and Uses of Cash Flow\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (The CARES Act\u201d) was enacted. We have analyzed the provisions, which provide for a technical correction to allow for full expensing of qualified leasehold improvements, modifications to charitable contribution and net operating loss limitations ( NOLs\u201d), modifications to the deductibility of business interest expense, as well as Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit acceleration. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was an income tax benefit of $7.2 million for the carryback of NOLs to higher tax rate years, recorded in Fiscal 2021. As of May 1, 2021, we recognized a current income tax receivable for NOL carrybacks of $30.5 million in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We received a $7.8 million refund in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 and expect to receive additional refunds of approximately $22.7 million.\nTextbook Rental Inventories\nReserves for non-returnable inventory are based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory. Reserve calculations are sensitive to certain significant assumptions, including markdowns, sales below cost, inventory aging and expected demand. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the non-returnable inventory reserve. However, if assumptions based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change\nSubscription-based revenue, which contains a single performance obligation, is deferred and recognized based on the passage of time over the subscription period commencing at the point of sale, when control of the service transfers to the customer. The majority of subscriptions sold are one month in duration.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we recognized a merchandise inventory loss and write-off of $0.4 million and $15.0 million, respectively, in cost of goods sold in the Retail Segment discussed below. Excluding the merchandise inventory loss and write-off, cost of goods sold and gross margin was 75.6% and 24.4%, respectively, of sales during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared to 81.3% and 18.7%, respectively, of sales during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Organization and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Merchandise Inventories.\n\n(a) Comparable sales data exclude the impact of the additional week for Fiscal 2020. Comparable store sales includes sales from physical stores that have been open for an entire fiscal year period and virtual store sales for the period, does not include sales from closed stores for all periods presented. Sales for logo and emblematic general merchandise fulfilled by FLC inventory and digital agency sales are included on a gross basis. We believe the current comparable store sales calculation method reflects the manner in which management views comparable sales, as well as the seasonal nature of our business.\nSegments\n\nRetail\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nRevenue from the rental of digital textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is recognized at the point of sale. A software feature is embedded within the content of our digital textbooks, such that upon expiration of the rental term the customer is no longer able to access the content. While the digital rental allows the customer to access digital content for a fixed period of time, once the digital content is delivered to the customer, our performance obligation is complete.\nComparable store sales for Retail decreased for the 52 week sales period. Comparable store sales were impacted primarily by COVID-19 related campus temporary store closures, lower enrollment and on-campus events (all discussed above), a shift to lower cost options and more affordable solutions, including digital offerings, increased consumer purchases directly from publishers and other online providers, lower general merchandise sales (including graduation products and logo products for athletic events). These decreases were partially offset by increased First Day, digital and eTextbook revenue. Comparable store sales variances for Retail by category for the 52 week period is as follows:\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nDSS total sales increased by $8.3 million, or 30.3%, to $35.7 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 20221 from $27.4 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Sales increased primarily due to an increase in subscription sales.\nProduct sales and rentals\nWe do not have gift card or customer loyalty programs. We do not treat any promotional offers as expenses. Sales tax collected from our customers is excluded from reported revenues. Our payment terms are generally 30 days and do not extend beyond one year.\nCorporate Services\nOur cost of sales primarily includes costs such as merchandise costs, textbook rental amortization, content development cost amortization, warehouse costs related to inventory management and order fulfillment, insurance, certain payroll costs, and management service agreement costs, including rent expense, related to our college and university contracts and other facility related expenses.\nFor the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, excluding the $15.0 million of merchandise inventory loss and write-off, $10.7 million of restructuring and other charges and the $27.6 million impairment loss (non-cash), all discussed above, operating loss was $(123.6) million (or (8.6)% of sales).\nresults, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital and tax rates. We also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions, interest rates, market data, and other observable trends, such as comparable store sales trends, recent changes in publisher relationships, and development of innovative digital products and services in the rapidly changing education landscape. The discount rate used is based on the weighted-average cost of capital adjusted for the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the business's ability to execute on the projected cash flows. Under the market approach, we estimate the fair value based on market multiples of cash flows and earnings derived from comparable publicly-traded companies with similar operating and investment characteristics as the reporting unit and considering a reasonable control premium.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nRetail Gross Comparable Store Sales variances for Retail by category for the 52 week period are as follows:\n\nCash flows provided by operating activities during Fiscal 2021 were $32.9 million compared to cash flow used in operating activities of $(8.7) million during Fiscal 2020. This increase in cash provided by operating activities of $41.6 million was primarily due to proceeds from the sale of logo merchandise inventory to FLC of $41.8 million, partially offset by lower net income, an increase in other long-term liabilities due to sale of treasury shares at a premium (discussed above), and changes in working capital. As discussed above, our operations were highly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in Fiscal 2021.\n(a) In Fiscal 2022, 2021 and Fiscal 2020, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, we reported a net loss of $(139.8) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, compared with a net loss of $(38.3) million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) is $() million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, compared with $(21.1) million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. See Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) discussion below.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we recognized restructuring and other charges totaling $10.7 million (Restated), comprised primarily of $6.6 million for severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives, $5.7 million for professional service costs related to restructuring, process improvements, the financial advisor strategic review process, costs related to development and integration associated with Fanatics and FLC partnership agreements and shareholder activist activities, and liabilities for a facility closure, partially offset by a $1.6 million in an actuarial gain related to a frozen retirement benefit plan (non-cash).\n(b) Service revenue includes brand partnerships, shipping and handling, and revenue from other programs.\nThe Retail Segment operates 1,427 college, university, and K-12 school bookstores, comprised of 805 physical bookstores and 622 virtual bookstores. Our bookstores typically operate under agreements with the college, university, or K-12 schools to be the official bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products. The majority of the physical campus bookstores have school-branded e-commerce sites which we operate independently or along with our merchant partners, and which offer students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. The Retail Segment also offers inclusive access programs, in which course materials are offered at a reduced price through a fee charged by the institution or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. Additionally, the Retail Segment offers a suite of digital content and services to colleges and universities, including a variety of open educational resource-based courseware.\nFor a discussion of our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business.\n\nCost is determined primarily by the retail inventory method for our Retail Segment and last-in first out, or LIFO\u201d, method for our Wholesale Segment. Our textbook inventories, for Retail and Wholesale, and trade book inventories are valued using the LIFO method and the related reserve was not material to the recorded amount of our inventories. There were no LIFO adjustments in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and consider market participants in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the long-lived assets of the reporting units for impairment at the lowest asset group level for which individual cash flows can be identified. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compared the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the assets to the fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows. If required, an impairment loss is recorded for that portion of the asset's carrying value in excess of fair value.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nThe following table summarizes our sales:\nAs of April 30, 2022, our other long-lived assets include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets of $94.1 million, $286.6 million, $129.6 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $3.6 million, or 6.8%, to $49.4 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $53.0 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower depreciable assets and intangibles due to the store impairment loss recognized during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021. See impairment loss discuss below.\n\nNet interest expense increased by $2.0 million to $10.1 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $8.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 primarily due to higher borrowings compared to the prior year.\nInterest Expense, Net\nOperating Loss\n\n\u2022First Day Complete is adopted by an institution and includes all classes, providing students both physical and digital materials. The First Day Complete model drives substantially greater unit sell-through for the bookstore.\nFor our retail operations, sales are generally highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks and other course materials, and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Sales attributable to our wholesale business are generally highest in our first, second and third quarter, as it sells textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. For our DSS segment, or direct-to-student business, sales and operating profit are realized relatively consistently throughout the year.\nIncome Taxes\n\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, sales eliminations were $56.2 million and $89.8 million, respectively. These sales eliminations represent the elimination of Wholesale sales and fulfillment service fees to Retail and the elimination of Retail commissions earned from Wholesale.\nPhysical textbooks out on rent are categorized as textbook rental inventories. At the time a rental transaction is consummated, the book is removed from merchandise inventories and moved to textbook rental inventories at cost. The cost of the book is amortized down to its estimated residual value over the rental period. The related amortization expense is included in cost of goods sold. At the end of the rental period, upon return, the book is removed from textbook rental inventories and recorded in merchandise inventories at its amortized cost. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate rental cost of goods sold. However, if our estimates regarding residual value are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 1% change in rental cost of goods sold would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $0.4 million in Fiscal 2022.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, logo and emblematic sales are reflected in sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis prior to April 4, 2021. See Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below. During the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Retail Gross Comparable Store general merchandise sales increased by 76.1%, as compared to a 45.9% decline a year ago. Both results during both periods benefited greatly from the return to an on campus learning experience and the resumption of many activities and events. Sales for general merchandise, including on-campus cafe and convenience products, and trade merchandise have increased compared to the prior year, when sales were impacted by the temporary store closings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, general merchandise sales are still impacted by fewer students returning to campus, as many schools implemented a remote or hybrid learning model and curtailed on-campus classes and activities.\nFor the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, excluding the $0.4 million of merchandise inventory loss and write-off, $1.0 million of restructuring and other charges and the $6.4 million impairment loss (non-cash), all discussed above, operating loss was $(59.6) million (or (3.9)% of sales).\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities during Fiscal 2022 were $(42.7) million compared to $(36.9) million during Fiscal 2021.

Income taxes are reflected in Corporate Services as we record our income tax provision on a consolidated basis.\nRetail\nCOVID-19 Business Impact\nDSS\nRetail\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine long-term incentive compensation expense. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the long-term incentive compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the long-term incentive compensation. A 10% change in our long-term incentive compensation expense would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.1 million in Fiscal 2022.\nOur total sales decreased by $417.2 million, or 22.5%, to $1,433.9 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $1,851.1 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The sales decrease is primarily related to the impact of the additional week for Fiscal 2020, the impact from temporary store closings related to COVID-19 earlier in the fiscal year, as well as lower in store foot traffic, lower enrollments and fewer on-campus events due to COVID-19. The components of the variances are reflected in the table below.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nThe Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, material breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, default on other material indebtedness, customary ERISA events of default, bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, invalidity of liens on collateral, change of control or cessation of business.

We are in compliance with all covenants, representations and warranties under the Credit Facility as of April 30, 2022.\n\nCorporate Services' selling and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million, or 4.2%, to $23.0 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher professional services costs.\nWe will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and our campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management or market factors currently in place change, there could be a further impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, our business continued to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. We cannot accurately predict the duration or extent of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, including variants, on enrollments, campus activities, university budgets, athletics and other areas that directly affect our business operations. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings, and its effect on our ability to source products, including textbooks and general merchandise offerings.\nOn December 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $50 million, in the aggregate, of our outstanding common stock. The stock repurchase program is carried out at the direction of management (which may include a plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The stock repurchase program may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time. Any repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and will be available for general corporate purposes. During Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, we did not purchase shares under the stock repurchase program. As of April 30, 2022, approximately $26.7 million remains available under the stock repurchase program.\nFor a discussion of our trends and other factors affecting our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business.\nEvaluation of Goodwill Impairment\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, among other provisions. In accordance with SAB 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (SAB 118), we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act within the provisional period as of April 27, 2019. We recorded measurement period adjustments during Fiscal 2019 to reduce our net deferred tax liability by $3.9 million, which primarily relates to the acceleration of certain deductions as permitted by the U.S. tax code. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was a $20.4 million reduction of the value of our net deferred (which represents future tax liabilities) and long-term tax liabilities as a result of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was recorded in Fiscal 2018. We also recorded a liability associated with the one-time transition tax.

We offer our BNC First Day\u00ae inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day and First Day Complete, in which course materials, including both physical and digital content, are offered at a reduced price through a course fee or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as substitutes for and should not be considered superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our use of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly named measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nAs of April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we had restricted cash of $11.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively, comprised of $10.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet related to segregated funds for commission due to FLC for logo merchandise sales as per the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and $0.9 million as of the end of both periods in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet related to amounts held in trust for future distributions related to employee benefit plans.\n\n\nThe costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired are carried as goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with ASC 350-10, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we complete our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the third quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of both May 1, 2021 and May 2, 2020, we had $0, $0 and $4,700 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets related to our Retail, Wholesale, and DSS reporting units, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, the Company intends to file an application to change its tax year from January to April under the automatic consent provisions. As a result of the tax year-end change, there is no longer a long-term tax payable associated with the LIFO reserve in other long-term liabilities.\nThe fair value of the impaired long-lived assets were determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), using the Company's best estimates of the amount and timing of future discounted cash flows, based on historical experience, market conditions, current trends and performance expectations.

See Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) discussion below.\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded.\nWe have filed our federal income tax returns for the tax year ended January 2021, as well claims for refunds for cash taxes paid in prior years. We received a $7.8 million refund in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 and expect to receive additional refunds of approximately $22.6 million.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\n(b)In Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The impact of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the Retail gross margin:\nTo supplement our results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we use the measure of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) regulations. We define Adjusted Earnings as net income adjusted for certain reconciling items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) interest expense and (3) income taxes, (4) as adjusted for items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss). We define Free Cash Flow as Cash Flows from Operating Activities less capital expenditures, cash interest and cash taxes.\nWe believe the Barnes & Noble brand (licensed from our former parent) along with our subsidiary brands, BNC and MBS, are synonymous with innovation in bookselling and campus retailing, and are widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large college footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students, and faculty, but are also important to our relationship with leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels, and for being a trusted source for students in our direct-to-student digital solutions business.\nThe results of operations reflected in our consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8.

These cost of sales eliminations represent (i) the recognition of intercompany profit for Retail inventory that was purchased from Wholesale in a prior period that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period and the elimination of Wholesale service fees charged for fulfillment of inventory for virtual store sales, net of (ii) the elimination of intercompany profit for Wholesale inventory purchases by Retail that remain in ending inventory at the end of the current period.\nContractual Obligations\n\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nRetail Segment\neither eliminated or severely restricted, which further impacted our general merchandise business. As we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% decrease in our estimated discounted cash flows would not have materially affected the results of our operations in Fiscal 2022.\nPhantom shares will be settled in cash based on the fair market value of a share of common stock at each vesting date in an amount not to exceed a specific price per share. The fair value of the phantom shares was determined using the closing stock price on the date of the award less the fair value of the call option which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the liability for the cash-settled phantom share unit awards will be remeasured at the end of each reporting period through settlement to reflect current risk-free rate and volatility assumptions.\nRestructuring and other charges\nWe review these non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures to evaluate our performance at a consolidated level and at a segment level and manage our operations. We believe that these measures are useful performance measures which are used by us to facilitate a comparison of our on-going operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone, as they exclude certain items that management believes do not reflect the ordinary performance of our operations in a particular period. Our Board of Directors and management also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, at a consolidated and at a segment level, as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting expected performance, for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a measure for performance incentive plans. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to determine segment capital allocations. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment results provides investors useful and important information regarding our operating results, in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements and assists investors in their understanding of our operating profitability and liquidity as we manage the business to maximize margin and cash flow.\nSales\n(a) Purchases of property and equipment are also referred to as capital expenditures. Our investing activities consist principally of capital expenditures for contractual capital investments associated with renewing existing contracts, new store construction, digital initiatives and enhancements to internal systems and our website. The following table provides the components of total purchases of property and equipment:\nOur cost of sales increased as a percentage of sales to 82.4% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to 76.1% during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Our gross margin decreased by $189.9 million, or 42.9%, to $252.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $442.5 million, or 23.9% of sales, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.\nRental income for Retail decreased by $45.7 million, or 25.4%, to $134.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $179.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Rental income is impacted by comparable store sales, new store openings and store closings. The decrease in rental income is primarily due to decreased rental activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed above and the impact of increased digital offerings.\nResults of Operations - 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared with the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, we recorded an impairment loss (non-cash) of $0.4 million in the Retail segment related to net capitalized development costs for a project which are not recoverable. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, in conjunction with COVID-19 related campus store closures, we evaluated certain of our long-lived assets associated with our Retail and Wholesale segments for impairment. Based on the results of the tests, for the Retail segment, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.6 million related to store-level assets in restructuring and other charges. These long-lived assets were not recoverable and had a de minimis fair value, as determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), resulting in a non-cash impairment charge for the full carrying value of those long-lived assets.\nLong-term Growth Rates- We also utilize an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which our cash flow stream is projected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value and are added to the cash flows projected during our five-year planning period; and\nclosures). We have made continued progress in the development of our next generation e-commerce platform, which launched in Fiscal 2021 to deliver increased high-margin general merchandise sales.\n\nRetail\nThe effective tax rate for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 is higher as compared to the comparable prior year period due to various permanent differences and the impact of the CARES Act.\n\n(e) We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, sales eliminations were $89.8 million and $83.9 million, respectively. These sales eliminations represent the elimination of Wholesale sales and fulfillment service fees to Retail and the elimination of Retail commissions earned from Wholesale.\nexisting contracts and new store construction. Capital expenditures totaled $(43.5) million and $(37.2) million during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively.\nOur business is highly seasonal. For our retail operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and third fiscal quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks and other course materials for the upcoming semesters based on the typical academic semester. When a school adopts our First Day inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the student drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. For our wholesale operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, as payments are received from the summer and winter selling season when they sell textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. For both retail and wholesale, cash flows from operating activities are typically a use of cash in the fourth fiscal quarter, when sales volumes are materially lower than the other quarters. For our DSS segment, cash flows are not seasonal as cash flows from operating activities are typically consistent throughout the year. Our quarterly cash flows also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various school's semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods.\nWholesale\n\u2022Product and other gross margin decreased (770 basis points), driven primarily by lower margin rates (435 basis points) due to higher markdowns, an unfavorable sales mix (370 basis points) due to lower high-margin general merchandise sales of approximately $231.2 million and the shift to lower margin digital courseware, and a merchandise inventory loss and write-off (100 basis points) of $15.0 million, comprised of a loss of $10.3 million related to the sale of our logo and emblematic general merchandise inventory below cost to FLC and an inventory write-off of $4.7 million related to our initiative to exit certain product offerings and streamline/rationalize our overall non-logo general merchandise product assortment resulting from the centralization of our merchandising decision-making during the year, partially offset by higher contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts (130 basis points) resulting from contract renewals and new store contracts.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n(b) For additional information related to the intercompany activities and eliminations, see Part II - Item 8.

For Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales details, see below.\nUse of Non-GAAP Measures - Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow\nRetail\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, we reported a net loss of $(68.9) million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, compared with a net loss of $(139.8) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) is $(55.6) million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, compared with $(96.5) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. See Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) discussion below.\n(c) For additional information related to the intercompany activities and eliminations, see Part II - Item 8.

For information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 7. Fair Value Measurements.\nWe have a credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), amended March 31, 2021 and March 1, 2019, under which the lenders committed to provide us with a five-year asset-backed revolving credit facility in an aggregate committed principal amount of $400 million (the Credit Facility\u201d). We have the option to request an increase in commitments under the Credit Facility of up to $100 million, subject to certain restrictions. Proceeds from the Credit Facility are used for general corporate purposes, including seasonal working capital needs. The agreement includes an incremental first in, last out seasonal loan facility (the FILO Facility\u201d) for a $100 million incremental facility maintaining the maximum availability under the Credit Agreement at $500 million.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nThe following is Adjusted EBITDA by segment for Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020:\nCash flows provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2022 were $45.7 million compared to $11.8 million during Fiscal 2021. The net change of $33.9 million is primarily due to higher net borrowings under the credit agreement, offset by proceeds from the sale of treasury shares of $10.9 million during Fiscal 2021.\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $(45.2) million on a pre-tax loss of $(185.0) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, which represented an effective income tax rate of 24.4% and an income tax benefit of $(12.0) million on a pre-tax loss of $(50.2) million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, which represented an effective income tax rate of 23.8%.\nDSS\nThe cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $92.5 million, or 82.4% of sales, and $19.8 million, or 17.6% of sales, respectively, during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022. The cost of sales and gross margin for Wholesale were $131.1 million, or 79.1% of sales, and $34.7 million, or 20.9% of sales, respectively, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The gross margin decreased to 17.6% during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from 20.9% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease was primarily due to the unfavorable impact of returns and allowances and higher markdowns, partially offset by a favorable sales mix.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n(e) Represents the income tax effects of the non-GAAP items.\nThe following table summarizes the Retail cost of sales:\nUnless the context otherwise indicates, references to we,\u201d us,\u201d our\u201d and the Company\u201d refer to Barnes & Noble Education, Inc. or BNED\u201d, a Delaware corporation.

See discussion of intercompany activities and eliminations below.\nFor sales and rentals involving third-party products, we evaluate whether we are acting as a principal or an agent. Our determination is based on our evaluation of whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer. There are significant judgments involved in determining whether we control the specified goods or services prior to transferring them to the customer including whether we have the ability to direct the use of the good or service and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from the good or service. For those transactions where we are the principal, we record revenue on a gross basis, and for those transactions where we are an agent to a third-party, we record revenue on a net basis. Effective April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales to FLC and Fanatics. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our condensed consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021.\nFinancing Arrangements\nThe Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of the inventory, accounts receivable and related assets of the borrowers under the Credit Facility. This is considered an all asset lien (inclusive of proceeds from tax refunds payable to the Company and a pledge of equity from subsidiaries, exclusive of real estate).\nTo properly and prudently evaluate our business, we encourage you to review our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the reconciliation of Adjusted Earnings to net income (loss), the reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDA to consolidated net income (loss), and the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to net income (loss) by segment, the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with GAAP, set forth in the tables below. All of the items included in the reconciliations below are either (i) non-cash items or (ii) items that management does not consider in assessing our on-going operating performance.\nImpairment loss (non-cash)\nWholesale sales decreased by $32.5 million, or 16.4%, to $165.8 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $198.3 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The decrease is primarily due to decreased gross sales impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in customer demand resulting from a shift in buying patterns from physical textbooks to digital products, and lower demand from other third-party clients, partially offset by a lower returns and allowances.\nIncome Tax Implications on Liquidity\nIn December 2020, Fanatics, Inc. and Lids Holdings, Inc. jointly made a strategic equity investment in BNED. On April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement, we sold our logo and emblematic general merchandise inventory to FLC, which was finalized during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. As contemplated by the FLC Partnership's e-commerce agreement, we began to transition certain of our e-commerce sites to Fanatics e-commerce sites for logo and emblematic products during the first quarter of Fiscal 2022. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales on a gross basis prior to April 4, 2021. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Equity and Earnings Per Share.\nin actual non-returnable inventory would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $5.6 million in Fiscal 2022.\nProduct and other sales for Retail decreased by $336.7 million, or 22.0%, to $1,196.3 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $1,533.0 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Product and other sales are impacted by comparable store sales (as noted in the chart below), new store openings and store closings, as well as the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales were impacted by the temporary store closings due to COVID-19 earlier in the fiscal year, as well as the impact of fewer students returning to campus, as many schools implemented a remote learning model and curtailed on-campus classes and activities. While many big-conferences resumed their sport activities, fan attendance at the games was either eliminated or severely restricted, which further impacted the company's high-margin general merchandise business. Additionally, sales were impacted by overall enrollment declines in higher education. Textbook (Course Materials) revenue for Retail decreased primarily due to lower new and used textbook and other course materials sales, while First Day (our inclusive access program), digital and eTextbook revenue increased.\nOperating Loss\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWholesale\n(d) Earnings are adjusted for amortization expense (non-cash) related to content development costs which are included in cost of goods sold.\nOur business experienced an unprecedented and significant negative impact as a result of COVID-19 related campus store closures. Beginning in March 2020, colleges and universities nationwide began to close their campuses in light of safety concerns and as a result of local and state issued stay-at-home orders. By mid-March, during our Fiscal 2020 fourth quarter, we closed the majority of our physical campus stores to protect the health and safety of our customers and employees.\nTo supplement the Total Sales table presented above, the Company uses Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales as a key performance indicator. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales includes sales from physical and virtual stores that have been open for an entire fiscal year period and does not include sales from permanently closed stores for all periods presented. For Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales, sales for logo and emblematic general merchandise fulfilled by FLC, Fanatics and digital agency sales are included on a gross basis for consistent year-over-year comparison.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $27.6 million, $20.5 million after-tax, comprised of $5.1 million, $13.3 million, $6.3 million and $2.9 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively.\nBusiness Projections- We make assumptions about the level of revenues, gross profit, operating expenses, as well as capital expenditures and net working capital requirements. These assumptions drive our planning assumptions and represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections. These projections are developed using our internal business plans over a five-year planning period that are updated at least annually;\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n\nThe components of the sales variances for the 52 week period are reflected in the table below.\n(b)Our contracts for physical bookstores with colleges and universities are typically five years with renewal options, but can range from one to 15 years, and are typically cancelable by either party without penalty with 90 to 120 days' notice. Annual projections are based on current minimum guarantee amounts. In approximately 50% of our contracts with colleges and universities that include minimum guarantees, the minimum guaranteed amounts adjust annually to equal less than the prior year's commission earned. Excludes obligations under store leases for property insurance and real estate taxes, which totaled approximately 2.4% of the minimum rent payments under those leases.\n(a) Comparable store sales includes sales from physical stores that have been open for an entire fiscal year period and virtual store sales for the period, does not include sales from closed stores for all periods presented. Sales for logo and emblematic general merchandise fulfilled by FLC inventory and digital agency sales are included on a gross basis.\nThe Wholesale Segment is comprised of our wholesale textbook business and is one of the largest textbook wholesalers in the country. The Wholesale Segment centrally sources, sells, and distributes new and used textbooks to approximately 3,100 physical bookstores (including our Retail Segment's 805 physical bookstores) and sources and distributes new and used textbooks to our 622 virtual bookstores. Additionally, the Wholesale Segment sells hardware and a software suite of applications that provides inventory management and point-of-sale solutions to approximately 350 college bookstores.\nTrends and Other Factors Affecting Our Business\nMany of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value, and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment. The following assumptions are significant to our evaluation process:\nWe believe the current Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales calculation method reflects management's view that such comparable store sales are an important measure of the growth in sales when evaluating how established stores have performed over time. We present this metric as additional useful information about the Company's operational and financial performance and to allow greater transparency with respect to important metrics used by management for operating and financial decision-making. Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales are also referred to as \"same-store\" sales by others within the retail industry and the method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of comparable store sales is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies and is intended only as supplemental information and is not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with GAAP.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nIntercompany Eliminations\nThe following table summarizes the Retail cost of sales:\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nSales\n\nResults of Operations - Summary\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nThe comparability of Products and other sales, specifically logo and emblematic sales, is impacted by the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, as compared to on a gross basis prior to April 4, 2021. See the Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below.\nFor the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, excluding the $15.0 million of merchandise inventory loss and write-off, $10.7 million of restructuring and other charges and the $27.6 million impairment loss (non-cash), all discussed above, operating loss was $(123.6) million (or (8.6)% of sales).\nOur fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of April. Fiscal 2022\u201d means the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Fiscal 2021\u201d means the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, and Fiscal 2020\u201d means the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.\n\nDuring both 52 weeks periods ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, the gross margin eliminations was $0.1 million. The gross margin eliminations reflect the net impact of the sales eliminations and cost of sales eliminations during the above mentioned reporting periods.\n(c) Other includes inventory liquidation sales to third parties, marketplace sales and certain accounting adjusting items related to return reserves, and other deferred items.\nWe are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate, and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. If their actual forfeiture rate is materially different from their estimate, our long-term incentive compensation expense could be significantly different from what we recorded in the current period. For stock options granted with an \"at market\" exercise price, we determined the grant fair value using the Black-Scholes model and for stock options granted with \"a premium\" exercise price, we determined the grant date fair value using the Monte Carlo simulation model. The fair value models for stock options use assumptions that include the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividend yield and expected term of the options.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $8.9 million, or 14.4%, to $53.0 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $61.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower depreciable assets and intangibles due to the store impairment loss recognized during the third quarter of Fiscal 2021. See impairment loss discuss below.\nDSS\n(d)Other long-term liabilities excludes expected payments related to employee benefit plans. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 11. Employee Benefit Plans.\nFor our physical bookstores, we also estimate and accrue shortage for the period between the last physical count of inventory and the balance sheet date. Shortage rates are estimated and accrued based on historical rates and can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shortage trends. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate shortage rates. However, if our estimates regarding shortage rates are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10 basis point change in actual shortage rates would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $0.05 million in Fiscal 2022.\n\nIn December 2020, we entered into the FLC Partnership. Through this partnership, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our general merchandise business. Fanatics' cutting-edge e-commerce and technology expertise offers our campus stores expanded product selection, a world-class online and mobile experience, and a progressive direct-to-consumer platform. Coupled with Lids (FLC's parent company), the leading standalone brick and mortar retailer focused exclusively on licensed fan and alumni products, our campus stores have improved access to trend and sales performance data on licensees, product styles, and design treatments.\nvariant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales. These combined events continue to impact the Company's course materials and general merchandise business.\n\n(b) In Fiscal 2022, 2021 and Fiscal 2020, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Retail Gross Comparable Store course material sales increased by 2.3%, as compared to a 15.2% decline a year ago, when the majority of our stores had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below. The increase in course material sales was reflective of the growth of First Day inclusive access programs, digital and eTextbook revenue increases, due to a shift to lower cost options and more affordable solutions, including digital offerings. For the 2022 Spring term, First Day Complete was offered through 76 campus bookstores compared to 14 campus bookstores in the prior year, at schools with over 380,000 in total undergraduate enrollment, up from approximately 62,000 in total undergraduate enrollment in the 2021 Spring term. Revenue for both of our First Day models increased to $234.2 million during Fiscal 2022, as compared to $122.7 million in the prior year period.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, we also repurchased 239,751 shares, 414,174 shares, and 374,733 shares of our common stock, respectively, in connection with employee tax withholding obligations for vested stock awards.\n(c) See Management Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations discussion above.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nAs we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales later into the quarter or shifting some sales to our fourth quarter. We will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and our campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management or market factors currently in place change, there could be a further impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nFor Wholesale, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $0.1 million, or 0.5%, to $16.0 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $16.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower compensation expense and lower operating costs.\nNet Loss\nCorporate Services\nCash flows used in investing activities during Fiscal 2021 were $(36.9) million compared to $(37.0) million during Fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities is primarily for capital expenditures and contractual capital investments associated with content development, digital initiatives, enhancements to internal systems and websites, renewing existing contracts and new store construction and lower payments to acquire businesses and the change in other noncurrent assets for contractual obligations. Capital expenditures totaled $37.2 million and $36.2 million during Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively.\nGross margin for the DSS segment was $29.9 million, or 83.9% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and $22.3 million, or 81.5% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The gross margins are driven primarily by high margin subscription service revenue earned.\nRetail product revenue is recognized when the customer takes physical possession of our products, which occurs either at the point of sale for products purchased at physical locations or upon receipt of our products by our customers for products ordered through our websites and virtual bookstores. Wholesale product revenue is recognized upon shipment of physical textbooks at which point title passes and risk of loss is transferred to the customer. Additional revenue is recognized for shipping charges billed to customers and shipping costs are accounted for as fulfillment costs within cost of goods sold.\nCash flows provided by operating activities during Fiscal 2022 were $2.1 million compared to $32.9 million during Fiscal 2021. This decrease in cash provided by operating activities of $30.8 million was primarily due to $41.8 million of proceeds received in Fiscal 2021 for the sale of logo merchandise inventory to FLC and changes in working capital, including higher accounts receivables outstanding and higher inventory purchases, partially offset by improved earnings in the current year period compared to the prior year period and lower tax payments of $14.0 million compared to the prior year period. Our operations were highly impacted by COVID-19 related campus store closures in the prior year period, resulting in lower operating costs and lower inventory purchases in the prior year.\nThe impairment analysis process requires significant estimation to determine recoverability of each asset group and to determine the fair value of asset groups that were not recoverable, as well as the fair values of certain operating right-of-use assets included within the asset groups that were not recoverable. The significant assumptions used included annual revenue growth rates, gross margin rates and the estimated relationship of selling and administrative costs to revenue used to estimate the projected cash-flow directly related to the future operation of the stores as well as the weighted average cost of capital used to calculate the fair value. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair values of certain operating right-of-use assets included the current market rent and discount rate. These assumptions are subjective in nature and are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions (including the effects of the global pandemic).\nWholesale sales decreased by $53.6 million, or 32.3%, to $112.2 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $165.8 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease is primarily due to lower gross sales impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including supply constraints resulting from the lack of on campus textbook buyback opportunities during the prior fiscal year, a decrease in customer demand resulting from a shift in buying patterns from physical textbooks to digital products, and lower demand from other third-party clients, partially offset by lower returns and allowances. During the prior year period, the Wholesale operations assumed direct-to-student fulfillment of course material orders for the Retail Segment campus bookstores that were not fully operational due to COVID-19 campus store closures, whereas the sales shifted back to the physical bookstores in the current period.\nOn June 28, 2022, we obtained limited waivers with respect to the Credit Agreement and the Term Loan Credit Agreement, pursuant to which the requisite lenders thereunder waived any potential default or event of default under such agreements solely to the extent arising from the restatement of Fiscal 2021 consolidated financial statements as described in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nDSS Segment\nResults of Operations\nRestructuring and other charges\nWholesale\nThe following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the percentage relationship that certain items bear to total sales:\nWholesale\nThe Digital Student Solutions (\"DSS\") Segment includes products and services to assist students to study more effectively and improve academic performance. The DSS Segment is comprised of the operations of Student Brands, LLC, a leading direct-to-student subscription-based writing services business, and bartleby\u00ae, an institutional and direct-to-student subscription-based offering providing textbook solutions, expert questions and answers, writing and tutoring.\n\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, selling and administrative expenses increased by $45.2 million, or 13.4%, to $383.4 million from $338.3 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The variances by segment are discussed by segment below. The increase in selling and administrative expenses is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; and the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. In performing the valuation, we used cash flows that reflected management's forecasts and discount rates that included risk adjustments consistent with the current market conditions.\nRetail total sales increased by $109.2 million, or 8.2%, to $1,439.7 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $1,330.5 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Retail added 92 new stores and closed 82 stores during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, ending the period with a total of 1,427 stores.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n(c) Other includes inventory liquidation sales to third parties, marketplace sales and certain accounting adjusting items related to return reserves, and other deferred items.\nInterest under the Credit Facility accrues, at our election, at a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") or alternate base rate, plus, in each case, an applicable interest rate margin, which is determined by reference to the level of excess availability under the Credit Facility. Loans will initially bear interest at SOFR plus 2.00% per annum, in the case of SOFR borrowings, or at the alternate base rate plus 1.00% per annum, in the alternative, and thereafter the interest rate will fluctuate between SOFR plus 2.00% per annum and SOFR plus 1.50% per annum (or between the alternate base rate plus 1.000% per\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we recognized restructuring and other charges totaling $10.7 million (Restated), comprised primarily of $6.6 million for severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives, $5.7 million for professional service costs related to restructuring, process improvements, the financial advisor strategic review process, costs related to development and integration associated with Fanatics and FLC partnership agreements and shareholder activist activities, and liabilities for a facility closure, partially offset by a $1.6 million in an actuarial gain related to a frozen retirement benefit plan (non-cash).\nRevenue from the rental of physical textbooks, which contains a single performance obligation, is deferred and recognized over the rental period based on the passage of time commencing at the point of sale, when control of the product transfers to the customer. Rental periods are typically for a single semester and are always less than one year in duration. We offer a buyout option to allow the purchase of a rented physical textbook at the end of the rental period if the customer desires to do so. We record the buyout purchase when the customer exercises and pays the buyout option price which is determined at the time of the buyout. In these instances, we accelerate any remaining deferred rental revenue at the point of sale.\n(c) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nDescription of business\nWe have three reportable segments: Retail, Wholesale and DSS. Additionally, unallocated shared-service costs, which include various corporate level expenses and other governance functions, continue to be presented as Corporate Services\u201d. The following discussion provides information regarding the three segments.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary negative covenants, which limit the Company's ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, make restricted payments or specified payments and merge or acquire assets, among other things. In addition, if excess availability under the Credit Facility were to fall below certain specified levels, certain additional covenants (including fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and a minimum excess availability of the greater of 10% of the Loan Cap and $25.0 million when the FILO is funded) would be triggered, and the lenders would have the right to assume dominion and control over the Company's cash. The Credit Facility includes an anti-cash hoarding provision, which limits maximum excess cash allowed to $50.0 million when the FILO is funded.\n\nOur cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales to 75.7% during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared to 82.4% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Our gross margin increased by $120.1 million, or 47.5%, to $372.8 million, or 24.3% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $252.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, we borrowed $632.2 million and repaid $584.1 million under the Credit Agreement, with $225.7 million of outstanding borrowings as of April 30, 2022. During the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we borrowed $722.6 million and repaid $719.7 million under the Credit Agreement, with $177.6 million of outstanding borrowings as of May 1, 2021. During the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, we borrowed $600.9 million and repaid $559.7 million under the Credit Agreement, with $174.7 million of outstanding borrowings as of May 2, 2020. As of both April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we have issued $4.8 million in letters of credit under the Credit Facility.\nOur sales are primarily derived from the sale of course materials, which include new, used and digital textbooks, and at college and university bookstores which we operate, we sell high margin general merchandise, including emblematic apparel and gifts, trade books, computer products, school and dorm supplies, convenience and caf\u00e9 items and graduation products. Our rental income is primarily derived from the rental of physical textbooks. We also derive revenue from other sources, such as sales of inventory management, hardware and point-of-sale software, direct-to-student subscription-based services, and other services.\nWhile our campus stores were closed, we continued to serve institutions and students through our campus websites, providing free shipping on all orders and an expanded digital content offering to provide immediate access to course materials to students at our campuses that closed due to COVID-19. We developed and implemented plans to safely reopen our campus stores based on national, state and local guidelines, as well as the campus policies set by the school administration.\nService and other revenue\nDuring the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $0.4 million in the Retail segment related to net capitalized development costs for a project which are not recoverable.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nEffective April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales to FLC and Fanatics. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021.\n\nWe estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a weighting of fair values derived from the income approach and the market approach for our annual impairment testing and using the income approach for our interim impairment test. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Inherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating\nWe maintain our relationships with campus partners and remain responsible for staffing and managing the day-to-day operations of our campus bookstores. We also work closely with our campus partners to ensure that each campus store maintains unique aspects of in-store merchandising, including localized product assortments and specific styles and designs that reflect each campus's brand. We leverage Fanatics' e-commerce technology and expertise for the operational management of the emblematic merchandise and gift sections of our campus store websites. FLC manages in-store assortment planning and merchandising of emblematic apparel, headwear, and gift products for our partner campus stores.\nOur selling and administrative expenses consist primarily of store payroll and store operating expenses. Selling and administrative expenses also include long-term incentive plan compensation expense and general office expenses, such as merchandising, procurement, field support, finance and accounting, and operating costs related to our direct-to-student subscription-based services business. Shared-service costs such as human resources, legal, treasury, information technology, and various other corporate level expenses and other governance functions, are not allocated to any specific reporting segment and are recorded in Corporate Services as discussed in the Overview - Segments discussion above.\nThe $0.1 million of gross margin elimination reflects the net impact of the sales eliminations and cost of sales eliminations during both the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, respectively. The gross margin eliminations reflect the net impact of the sales eliminations and cost of sales eliminations during the above mentioned reporting periods.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nOur Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020 results have been significantly impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many schools continued to adjust their learning model and on-campus activities in response to the pandemic. See \"Overview\" for more information.\nDSS\nRetail Gross Comparable Store Sales\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, the cost of sales eliminations were $56.2 million and $89.8 million, respectively. These cost of sales eliminations represent (i) the recognition of intercompany profit for Retail inventory that was purchased from Wholesale in a prior period that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period and the elimination of Wholesale service fees charged for fulfillment of inventory for virtual store sales, net of (ii) the elimination of intercompany profit for Wholesale inventory purchases by Retail that remain in ending inventory at the end of the current period.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nOur business has been significantly negatively impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, as many schools continued to adjust their learning models and on-campus activities. Many of the trends observed during the Fall 2021 semester continued into the Spring 2022 semester, as fewer students have returned to campus for the Spring semester. As we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron\nCash Flow from Investing Activities\nOur total sales increased by $97.5 million, or 6.8%, to $1,531.4 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $1,433.9 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The sales increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. The increase is offset by the negative impact on sales primarily due to lower enrollments, primarily at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings and lower logo and emblematic sales as they are reflected in sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021. For additional information, see Retail Sales discussion below.\n\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nWe recorded an income tax benefit of $(8.7) million on a pre-tax loss of $(77.5) million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, which represented an effective income tax rate of 11.2% and an income tax benefit of $(45.2) million on a pre-tax loss of $(185.0) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, which represented an effective income tax rate of 24.4%.\nRetail total sales decreased by $382.4 million, or 22.3%, to $1,330.5 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $1,712.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Retail added 98 new stores and closed 100 stores (not including temporary store closings due to COVID-19) during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, ending the period with a total of 1,417 stores.\nBasis of Consolidation\n(a)We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nThe assumptions used in calculating the fair value of long-term incentive compensation payment awards represent management's best estimates, but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. See Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 12. Long-Term Incentive Compensation Expense for a further discussion of our stock-based incentive plan.\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP, we are required to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments with respect to certain amounts included in the financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nDiscount Rates- The estimated future cash flows are then discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.\n\n(c)Includes information technology contracts.\nCOVID-19 Business Impact\nNet Loss\nFor Retail, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $69.7 million, or 20.0%, to $278.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $347.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to a $59.3 million decrease in stores payroll and operating expenses, including comparable stores, primarily due to temporary furloughed store employees, lower virtual stores and new/closed stores payroll and operating expenses, and a decrease of $10.4 million in corporate payroll, infrastructure costs, product development costs and digital operations costs.\nGross margin for the DSS segment was $22.3 million, or 81.5% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and $19.3 million, or 81.6% of sales, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to higher bartleby subscription sales.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash Flow from Operating Activities\nIntercompany Eliminations\nOur business is highly seasonal. Our quarterly results also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various schools' semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods. Our fiscal year is comprised of 52 or 53 weeks, ending on the Saturday closest to the last day of April.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $66.2 million, or 16.4%, to $338.3 million from $404.5 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The variances by segment are as follows:\n(a) In Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The impact of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nBarnes & Noble Education, Inc. ( BNED\u201d) is one of the largest contract operators of physical and virtual bookstores for college and university campuses and K-12 institutions across the United States. We are also one of the largest textbook wholesalers, inventory management hardware and software providers, and a leading provider of digital education solutions. We operate 1,427 physical, virtual, and custom bookstores and serve more than 6 million students, delivering essential educational content, tools and general merchandise within a dynamic omnichannel retail environment. Additionally, we offer direct-to-student products and services to help students study more effectively and improve academic performance.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (The CARES Act\u201d) was enacted. We have analyzed the provisions, which provide for a technical correction to allow for full expensing of qualified leasehold improvements, modifications to charitable contribution and net operating loss limitations ( NOLs\u201d), modifications to the deductibility of business interest expense, as well as Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit acceleration. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was an income tax benefit of $7.2 million for the carryback of NOLs to higher tax rate years, recorded in Fiscal 2021. As of May 1, 2021, we recognized a current income tax receivable for NOL carrybacks of $30.5 million in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet.\nOverview\nImpairment loss (non-cash)\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we recognized a merchandise inventory loss and write-off of $15.0 million in cost of goods sold in the Retail Segment discussed below. Excluding the merchandise inventory loss and write-off, cost of goods sold and gross margin was 81.3% and 18.7%, respectively, of sales during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to 76.1% and 23.9%, respectively, of sales during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 1. Organization and Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Merchandise Inventories.\nPartnership marketing agreements often include multiple performance obligations which are individually negotiated with our customers. For these arrangements that contain distinct performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price based on the relative standalone selling price method by comparing the standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d) of each distinct performance obligation to the total value of the contract. The revenue is recognized as each performance obligation is satisfied, typically at a point in time for partnership marketing service and overtime for advertising efforts as measured based upon the passage of time for contracts that are based on a stated period of time or the number of impressions delivered for contracts with a fixed number of impressions.\nOur primary sources of cash are net cash flows from operating activities, funds available under our credit agreement and short-term vendor financing. As of April 30, 2022, we had $225.7 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement. See Financing Arrangements discussion below.\nDespite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. We cannot accurately predict the duration or extent of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, including variants, on enrollments, campus activities, university budgets, athletics and other areas that directly affect our business operations. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings, and its effect on our ability to source products, including textbooks and general merchandise offerings.\nOur operating loss was $(67.4) million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared to operating loss of $(176.9) million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. This operating loss increase was due to the matters discussed above.\nCash flows provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2021 were $11.8 million compared to $39.9 million during Fiscal 2020. This net change of $28.1 million is primarily due to higher net borrowings under the credit agreement and the sale of treasury shares of $10.9 million (discussed above), partially offset by the payment of deferred financing costs of $1.1 million.\nDuring the third quarter of Fiscal 2022, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $6.4 million (both pre-tax and after-tax), comprised of $0.7 million, $1.8 million, $3.7 million and $0.2 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively, on the consolidated statement of operations.\nThe strengths of our business include our ability to compete by developing new products and solutions to meet market needs, our large operating footprint with direct access to students and faculty, our well-established, deep relationships with academic partners and stable, long-term contracts and our well-recognized brands. We expect to continue to introduce scalable and advanced digital solutions focused largely on the student, expand our e-commerce capabilities and accelerate such capabilities through our merchandising partnership with Fanatics Retail Group Fulfillment, LLC, Inc. ( Fanatics\u201d) and Fanatics Lids College, Inc. ( FLC\u201d) (collectively referred to herein as the FLC Partnership\u201d), increase market share with new accounts, and expand our strategic opportunities through acquisitions and partnerships.\nSee Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 10. Related Party Transactions.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales later into the quarter or shifting some sales to our fourth quarter. We will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and\nOur operating loss was $(176.9) million during the 53 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to operating loss of $(42.8) million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. This operating loss increase was due to the matters discussed above.\nWe believe that our future cash from operations, access to borrowings under the Credit Facility, FILO Facility and short-term financings will provide adequate resources to fund our operating and financing needs for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to, the economy and the outlook for and pace of sustainable growth in our markets, the levels at which we maintain inventory, the number and timing of new store openings, and any potential acquisitions of other brands or companies including digital properties. To the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing of debt or equity. Our access to, and the availability of, financing in the future will be impacted by many factors, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that we will have access to capital markets on acceptable terms.\nAdditionally, Product and other sales and Rental income are impacted by the growth of First Day Complete, comparable store sales, new store openings and store closings, as well as the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales were impacted by overall enrollment declines in higher education. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall 2021 semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, and the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings. While many college athletic conferences resumed their sport activities, other on campus events, such as parent's weekends or alumni events, continue to be\nThe effective tax rate for the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 is significantly lower as compared to the prior year comparable period due to the change in pre-tax loss and the change in the assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets as compared to prior year loss carrybacks.\n(a) Represents the percentage these costs bear to the related sales, instead of total sales.\nFor the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, the Retail gross margin as a percentage of sales increased as discussed below:\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nFor DSS, selling and administrative expenses increased by $7.4 million to $29.5 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The increase in costs was primarily driven by higher compensation expense, higher operating costs invested in the business associated with product development and sales infrastructure costs aimed at increasing revenue.\nService and other revenue is primarily derived from DSS segment subscription-based service revenues and partnership marketing services which includes promotional activities and advertisements within our physical bookstores and web properties performed on behalf of third-party customers.\nConsolidated Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $6.4 million (both pre-tax and after-tax), comprised of $0.7 million, $1.8 million, $3.7 million and $0.2 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively.\n\n\nFree Cash Flow (non-GAAP)\nMerchandise Inventories\nWholesale\nFor Wholesale, selling and administrative expenses decreased by $2.1 million, or 11.8%, to $16.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $18.2 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by lower payroll and operating costs.\nShare Repurchases\nOffering courseware sales through our inclusive access First Day and First Day Complete models is a key, and increasingly important strategic initiative of ours to meet the market demands of substantially reduced pricing to students, as well as the opportunity to improve student outcomes, while, at the same time, increasing our market share, revenue and relative gross profits of courseware sales given the higher volumes of units sold in such models as compared to historical sales models that rely on individual student marketing and sales.

The increase was primarily due to higher compensation-related expenses and higher operating expenses.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, we evaluated certain of our store-level long-lived assets in the Retail segment for impairment. Based on the results of the impairment tests, we recognized an impairment loss (non-cash) of $27.6 million, $20.5 million after-tax, comprised of $5.1 million, $13.3 million, $6.3 million and $2.9 million of property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets, respectively.\n\nFor Retail, selling and administrative expenses increased by $37.0 million, or 13.3%, to $315.1 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $278.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. This increase was primarily due to a $34.5 million increase in stores payroll and operating expenses including comparable stores, virtual stores and new/closed stores payroll and operating expenses, and a $2.5 million increase in corporate payroll, infrastructure and product development costs. The payroll increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, we recognized restructuring and other charges totaling $1.0 million, comprised primarily of $1.3 million for severance and other employee termination and benefit costs associated with elimination of various positions as part of cost reduction objectives and $1.8 million for costs associated with professional service costs for restructuring, process improvements, development and integration associated with the FLC Partnership, shareholder activist activities, and liabilities for a facility closure, partially offset by a $2.1 million in an actuarial gain related to a frozen retirement benefit plan (non-cash).\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with ASC 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. For information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.\nSources and Uses of Cash Flow\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (The CARES Act\u201d) was enacted. We have analyzed the provisions, which provide for a technical correction to allow for full expensing of qualified leasehold improvements, modifications to charitable contribution and net operating loss limitations ( NOLs\u201d), modifications to the deductibility of business interest expense, as well as Alternative Minimum Tax ( AMT\u201d) credit acceleration. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was an income tax benefit of $7.2 million for the carryback of NOLs to higher tax rate years, recorded in Fiscal 2021. As of May 1, 2021, we recognized a current income tax receivable for NOL carrybacks of $30.5 million in prepaid and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheet. We received a $7.8 million refund in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 and expect to receive additional refunds of approximately $22.7 million.\nTextbook Rental Inventories\nReserves for non-returnable inventory are based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory. Reserve calculations are sensitive to certain significant assumptions, including markdowns, sales below cost, inventory aging and expected demand. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate the non-returnable inventory reserve. However, if assumptions based on our history of liquidating non-returnable inventory are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change\nSubscription-based revenue, which contains a single performance obligation, is deferred and recognized based on the passage of time over the subscription period commencing at the point of sale, when control of the service transfers to the customer. The majority of subscriptions sold are one month in duration.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we recognized a merchandise inventory loss and write-off of $0.4 million and $15.0 million, respectively, in cost of goods sold in the Retail Segment discussed below. Excluding the merchandise inventory loss and write-off, cost of goods sold and gross margin was 75.6% and 24.4%, respectively, of sales during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared to 81.3% and 18.7%, respectively, of sales during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.

Our bookstores typically operate under agreements with the college, university, or K-12 schools to be the official bookstore and the exclusive seller of course materials and supplies, including physical and digital products. The majority of the physical campus bookstores have school-branded e-commerce sites which we operate independently or along with our merchant partners, and which offer students access to affordable course materials and affinity products, including emblematic apparel and gifts. The Retail Segment also offers inclusive access programs, in which course materials are offered at a reduced price through a fee charged by the institution or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class. Additionally, the Retail Segment offers a suite of digital content and services to colleges and universities, including a variety of open educational resource-based courseware.\nFor a discussion of our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business.\n\nCost is determined primarily by the retail inventory method for our Retail Segment and last-in first out, or LIFO\u201d, method for our Wholesale Segment. Our textbook inventories, for Retail and Wholesale, and trade book inventories are valued using the LIFO method and the related reserve was not material to the recorded amount of our inventories. There were no LIFO adjustments in Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020.\nWe review our long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable and consider market participants in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360-10, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate the long-lived assets of the reporting units for impairment at the lowest asset group level for which individual cash flows can be identified. When evaluating long-lived assets for potential impairment, we first compared the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the assets to the fair value based on estimated discounted future cash flows. If required, an impairment loss is recorded for that portion of the asset's carrying value in excess of fair value.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nThe following table summarizes our sales:\nAs of April 30, 2022, our other long-lived assets include property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, amortizable intangibles, and other noncurrent assets of $94.1 million, $286.6 million, $129.6 million, and $24.0 million, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheet.\nLong-Term Incentive Compensation\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $3.6 million, or 6.8%, to $49.4 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $53.0 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to lower depreciable assets and intangibles due to the store impairment loss recognized during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021. See impairment loss discuss below.\n\nNet interest expense increased by $2.0 million to $10.1 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $8.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 primarily due to higher borrowings compared to the prior year.\nInterest Expense, Net\nOperating Loss\n\n\u2022First Day Complete is adopted by an institution and includes all classes, providing students both physical and digital materials. The First Day Complete model drives substantially greater unit sell-through for the bookstore.\nFor our retail operations, sales are generally highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks and other course materials, and lowest in the first and fourth fiscal quarters. Sales attributable to our wholesale business are generally highest in our first, second and third quarter, as it sells textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. For our DSS segment, or direct-to-student business, sales and operating profit are realized relatively consistently throughout the year.\nIncome Taxes\n\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021, sales eliminations were $56.2 million and $89.8 million, respectively. These sales eliminations represent the elimination of Wholesale sales and fulfillment service fees to Retail and the elimination of Retail commissions earned from Wholesale.\nPhysical textbooks out on rent are categorized as textbook rental inventories. At the time a rental transaction is consummated, the book is removed from merchandise inventories and moved to textbook rental inventories at cost. The cost of the book is amortized down to its estimated residual value over the rental period. The related amortization expense is included in cost of goods sold. At the end of the rental period, upon return, the book is removed from textbook rental inventories and recorded in merchandise inventories at its amortized cost. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to calculate rental cost of goods sold. However, if our estimates regarding residual value are incorrect, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 1% change in rental cost of goods sold would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $0.4 million in Fiscal 2022.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, logo and emblematic sales are reflected in sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis prior to April 4, 2021. See Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales discussion below. During the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, Retail Gross Comparable Store general merchandise sales increased by 76.1%, as compared to a 45.9% decline a year ago. Both results during both periods benefited greatly from the return to an on campus learning experience and the resumption of many activities and events. Sales for general merchandise, including on-campus cafe and convenience products, and trade merchandise have increased compared to the prior year, when sales were impacted by the temporary store closings due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, general merchandise sales are still impacted by fewer students returning to campus, as many schools implemented a remote or hybrid learning model and curtailed on-campus classes and activities.\nFor the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, excluding the $0.4 million of merchandise inventory loss and write-off, $1.0 million of restructuring and other charges and the $6.4 million impairment loss (non-cash), all discussed above, operating loss was $(59.6) million (or (3.9)% of sales).\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nCash Flow from Financing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities during Fiscal 2022 were $(42.7) million compared to $(36.9) million during Fiscal 2021. The increase in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to higher capital expenditures and contractual capital investments associated with content development, digital initiatives, enhancements to internal systems and websites, renewing\nFirst Day Inclusive Access Programs\n\nDSS total sales increased by $3.7 million, or 15.7%, to $27.4 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $23.7 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, primarily due to higher bartleby subscription sales, which were partially offset by lower Student Brands sales.\n\nEvaluation of Other Long-Lived Assets Impairment\n(b) Interest expense is reflected in Corporate Services as it is primarily related to our Credit Agreement which funds our operating and financing needs across the organization. Income taxes are reflected in Corporate Services as we record our income tax provision on a consolidated basis.\nRetail\nCOVID-19 Business Impact\nDSS\nRetail\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions used to determine long-term incentive compensation expense. If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used, the long-term incentive compensation expense reported in our financial statements may not be representative of the actual economic cost of the long-term incentive compensation. A 10% change in our long-term incentive compensation expense would have affected pre-tax earnings by approximately $1.1 million in Fiscal 2022.\nOur total sales decreased by $417.2 million, or 22.5%, to $1,433.9 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $1,851.1 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The sales decrease is primarily related to the impact of the additional week for Fiscal 2020, the impact from temporary store closings related to COVID-19 earlier in the fiscal year, as well as lower in store foot traffic, lower enrollments and fewer on-campus events due to COVID-19. The components of the variances are reflected in the table below.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nThe Credit Facility contains customary events of default, including payment defaults, material breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, default on other material indebtedness, customary ERISA events of default, bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, invalidity of liens on collateral, change of control or cessation of business. The Credit Facility also contains customary affirmative covenants and representations and warranties. We are in compliance with all covenants, representations and warranties under the Credit Facility as of April 30, 2022.\n\nCorporate Services' selling and administrative expenses increased by $0.9 million, or 4.2%, to $23.0 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The increase was primarily due to higher professional services costs.\nWe will continue to assess our operations and will continue to consider the guidance of local governments and our campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. If economic conditions caused by the pandemic do not recover as currently estimated by management or market factors currently in place change, there could be a further impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows from operations.\nDuring Fiscal 2022, our business continued to be significantly negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, the pandemic remains highly volatile and continues to evolve. We cannot accurately predict the duration or extent of the impact of the COVID-19 virus, including variants, on enrollments, campus activities, university budgets, athletics and other areas that directly affect our business operations. Although most four year schools returned to a traditional on-campus environment for learning in the Fall semester, as well as hosted traditional on campus sporting activities, there is still uncertainty about the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including on enrollments at community colleges and by international students, the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings, and its effect on our ability to source products, including textbooks and general merchandise offerings.\nOn December 14, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $50 million, in the aggregate, of our outstanding common stock. The stock repurchase program is carried out at the direction of management (which may include a plan under Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). The stock repurchase program may be suspended, terminated, or modified at any time. Any repurchased shares will be held as treasury stock and will be available for general corporate purposes. During Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021, and Fiscal 2020, we did not purchase shares under the stock repurchase program. As of April 30, 2022, approximately $26.7 million remains available under the stock repurchase program.\nFor a discussion of our trends and other factors affecting our business, see Part I - Item 1. Business.\nEvaluation of Goodwill Impairment\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Act\u201d) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred, among other provisions. In accordance with SAB 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d (SAB 118), we completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act within the provisional period as of April 27, 2019. We recorded measurement period adjustments during Fiscal 2019 to reduce our net deferred tax liability by $3.9 million, which primarily relates to the acceleration of certain deductions as permitted by the U.S. tax code. The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was a $20.4 million reduction of the value of our net deferred (which represents future tax liabilities) and long-term tax liabilities as a result of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, which was recorded in Fiscal 2018. We also recorded a liability associated with the one-time transition tax. This amount is not material.\nour campus partners to determine how to operate our bookstores in the safest manner for our employees and customers. Please see our Part II - Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Overview for further discussion.\n\u2022Rental gross margin decreased (670 basis points), driven primarily by higher contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts (620 basis points) and unfavorable rental mix (80 basis points), partially offset by higher rental margin rates (30 basis points).\nWe provide product and service offerings designed to address the most pressing issues in higher education, including equitable access, enhanced convenience and improved affordability through innovative course material delivery models designed to drive improved student experiences and outcomes. We offer our BNC First Day\u00ae inclusive access programs, consisting of First Day and First Day Complete, in which course materials, including both physical and digital content, are offered at a reduced price through a course fee or included in tuition, and delivered to students on or before the first day of class.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not intended as substitutes for and should not be considered superior to measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our use of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different from similarly named measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes.\nAs of April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we had restricted cash of $11.5 million and $8.8 million, respectively, comprised of $10.6 million and $7.9 million, respectively, in prepaid and other current assets in the consolidated balance sheet related to segregated funds for commission due to FLC for logo merchandise sales as per the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and $0.9 million as of the end of both periods in other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheet related to amounts held in trust for future distributions related to employee benefit plans.\n\n\nThe costs in excess of net assets of businesses acquired are carried as goodwill in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In accordance with ASC 350-10, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, we complete our annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the third quarter of each fiscal year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. As of both May 1, 2021 and May 2, 2020, we had $0, $0 and $4,700 million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheets related to our Retail, Wholesale, and DSS reporting units, respectively.\nFor the fiscal year ended April 30, 2022, the Company intends to file an application to change its tax year from January to April under the automatic consent provisions. As a result of the tax year-end change, there is no longer a long-term tax payable associated with the LIFO reserve in other long-term liabilities.\nThe fair value of the impaired long-lived assets were determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), using the Company's best estimates of the amount and timing of future discounted cash flows, based on historical experience, market conditions, current trends and performance expectations. For additional information, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 6. Fair Value Measurements.\nMerchandise inventories, which consist of finished goods, are stated at the lower of cost or market. Market value of our inventory, which is all purchased finished goods, is determined based on its estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price less normally predictable costs of disposal and transportation.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nLoans under the FILO Facility will bear interest at a rate equal to the SOFR rate, plus 3.750%. In connection with the waiver, the applicable margin for credit extensions made under the FILO Facility after March 31, 2021 through the end of 2021 was increased by 0.50% (to 3.75% per annum for SOFR rate loans and 2.75% for base rate loans). The FILO Facility will be available solely during the draw period each year, from April 1 through July 31. We are required to borrow 100% of the aggregate commitments under the FILO Facility on April 1 of each year, and the loans must be repaid in full (including interest and fees) on July 31 of each year. The commitments under the FILO Facility decreased from $50.0 million to $25.0 million on August 1, 2021.

Additionally, general merchandise sales for Retail decreased primarily due to lower emblematic apparel sales (as many athletic events were canceled due to COVID-19), lower supply product sales and lower graduation product sales (primarily due to COVID-19 related campus\nNet interest expense increased by $0.6 million to $8.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $7.4 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020 primarily due to higher average borrowings.\nCost of Sales and Gross Margin\nDuring the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 and May 1, 2021, we incurred debt issuance costs totaling $0.3 million and $1.1 million related to the March 4, 2022 waiver and March 31, 2021 Credit Facility amendment. The debt issuance costs have been deferred and are presented as prepaid and other current assets and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets, and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the credit agreement.\nConsolidated Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP)\nImpact of U.S. Tax Reform\nFor DSS, selling and administrative expenses increased by $2.9 million to $22.1 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $19.2 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. The increase in costs was primarily driven by an increase in payroll costs, higher professional services and advertising costs.\n(a)As of April 30, 2022, we had a total of $225.7 million of outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility and FILO Facility. See Financing Arrangements discussion above for information about future borrowings and payments under the FILO Credit Facility. On June 7, 2022, subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2022, we entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement and we entered an amendment to the Credit Agreement. Part II - Item 8.

See Adjusted Earnings (non-GAAP) and Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP) discussion below.\nDeferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax basis and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. FASB guidance on accounting for income taxes requires that deferred tax assets be evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets, including our recent earnings experience and expectations of future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction, the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors. The actual realization of deferred tax assets may differ significantly from the amounts we have recorded.\nWe have filed our federal income tax returns for the tax year ended January 2021, as well claims for refunds for cash taxes paid in prior years. We received a $7.8 million refund in the second quarter of Fiscal 2022 and expect to receive additional refunds of approximately $22.6 million.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\n(b)In Fiscal 2022, Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, our business experienced an unprecedented and significant impact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The impact of which affects the comparability of our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe following table summarizes the Retail gross margin:\nTo supplement our results prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we use the measure of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, and Free Cash Flow, which are non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) regulations. We define Adjusted Earnings as net income adjusted for certain reconciling items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus (1) depreciation and amortization; (2) interest expense and (3) income taxes, (4) as adjusted for items that are subtracted from or added to net income (loss). We define Free Cash Flow as Cash Flows from Operating Activities less capital expenditures, cash interest and cash taxes.\nWe believe the Barnes & Noble brand (licensed from our former parent) along with our subsidiary brands, BNC and MBS, are synonymous with innovation in bookselling and campus retailing, and are widely recognized and respected brands in the United States. Our large college footprint, reputation, and credibility in the marketplace not only support our marketing efforts to universities, students, and faculty, but are also important to our relationship with leading publishers who rely on us as one of their primary distribution channels, and for being a trusted source for students in our direct-to-student digital solutions business.\nThe results of operations reflected in our consolidated financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\n\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, the cost of sales eliminations were $89.8 million and $84.0 million, respectively. These cost of sales eliminations represent (i) the recognition of intercompany profit for Retail inventory that was purchased from Wholesale in a prior period that was subsequently sold to external customers during the current period and the elimination of Wholesale service fees charged for fulfillment of inventory for virtual store sales, net of (ii) the elimination of intercompany profit for Wholesale inventory purchases by Retail that remain in ending inventory at the end of the current period.\nContractual Obligations\n\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nRetail Segment\neither eliminated or severely restricted, which further impacted our general merchandise business. As we entered the Spring rush period in early January 2022, we continued to experience the ongoing effects of COVID-19 with the surge of the Omicron variant further impacting students return to campus and on-campus activities. In early January, while the majority of schools brought students back to campus, some schools chose to conduct classes virtually for the beginning of the semester, while other schools chose to delay their start dates (and some schools both delayed the start of the semester and started classes virtually), thus reducing and/or delaying sales.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related to Restructuring and other charges for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nDuring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Accounting for income taxes requires a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the tax position will be fully sustained upon review by taxing authorities, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount with a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For tax positions that are 50 percent or less likely of being sustained upon audit, we do not recognize any portion of that benefit in the financial statements. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. Our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates.\nWe do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions used to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, if actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, we may be exposed to losses that could be material. A 10% decrease in our estimated discounted cash flows would not have materially affected the results of our operations in Fiscal 2022.\nPhantom shares will be settled in cash based on the fair market value of a share of common stock at each vesting date in an amount not to exceed a specific price per share. The fair value of the phantom shares was determined using the closing stock price on the date of the award less the fair value of the call option which was estimated using the Black-Scholes model. The fair value of the liability for the cash-settled phantom share unit awards will be remeasured at the end of each reporting period through settlement to reflect current risk-free rate and volatility assumptions.\nRestructuring and other charges\nWe review these non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures to evaluate our performance at a consolidated level and at a segment level and manage our operations. We believe that these measures are useful performance measures which are used by us to facilitate a comparison of our on-going operating performance on a consistent basis from period-to-period. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide for a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business than measures under GAAP can provide alone, as they exclude certain items that management believes do not reflect the ordinary performance of our operations in a particular period. Our Board of Directors and management also use Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment, at a consolidated and at a segment level, as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting expected performance, for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations, and as a measure for performance incentive plans. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA by Segment to determine segment capital allocations. We believe that the inclusion of Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA by Segment results provides investors useful and important information regarding our operating results, in a manner that is consistent with management's evaluation of business performance. We believe that Free Cash Flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements and assists investors in their understanding of our operating profitability and liquidity as we manage the business to maximize margin and cash flow.\nSales\n(a) Purchases of property and equipment are also referred to as capital expenditures. Our investing activities consist principally of capital expenditures for contractual capital investments associated with renewing existing contracts, new store construction, digital initiatives and enhancements to internal systems and our website. The following table provides the components of total purchases of property and equipment:\nOur cost of sales increased as a percentage of sales to 82.4% during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 compared to 76.1% during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Our gross margin decreased by $189.9 million, or 42.9%, to $252.7 million, or 17.6% of sales, during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $442.5 million, or 23.9% of sales, during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020.\nRental income for Retail decreased by $45.7 million, or 25.4%, to $134.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 from $179.9 million during the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020. Rental income is impacted by comparable store sales, new store openings and store closings. The decrease in rental income is primarily due to decreased rental activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic as discussed above and the impact of increased digital offerings.\nResults of Operations - 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 compared with the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021\nIn the first quarter of Fiscal 2020, we recorded an impairment loss (non-cash) of $0.4 million in the Retail segment related to net capitalized development costs for a project which are not recoverable. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2020, in conjunction with COVID-19 related campus store closures, we evaluated certain of our long-lived assets associated with our Retail and Wholesale segments for impairment. Based on the results of the tests, for the Retail segment, we recognized an impairment loss of $0.6 million related to store-level assets in restructuring and other charges. These long-lived assets were not recoverable and had a de minimis fair value, as determined using an income approach (Level 3 input), resulting in a non-cash impairment charge for the full carrying value of those long-lived assets.\nLong-term Growth Rates- We also utilize an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which our cash flow stream is projected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value and are added to the cash flows projected during our five-year planning period; and\nclosures). We have made continued progress in the development of our next generation e-commerce platform, which launched in Fiscal 2021 to deliver increased high-margin general merchandise sales.\n\nRetail\nThe effective tax rate for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 is higher as compared to the comparable prior year period due to various permanent differences and the impact of the CARES Act.\n\n(e) We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nDuring the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 and 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020, sales eliminations were $89.8 million and $83.9 million, respectively. These sales eliminations represent the elimination of Wholesale sales and fulfillment service fees to Retail and the elimination of Retail commissions earned from Wholesale.\nexisting contracts and new store construction. Capital expenditures totaled $(43.5) million and $(37.2) million during Fiscal 2022 and Fiscal 2021, respectively.\nOur business is highly seasonal. For our retail operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and third fiscal quarters, when students generally purchase and rent textbooks and other course materials for the upcoming semesters based on the typical academic semester. When a school adopts our First Day inclusive access offerings, cash collection from the school generally occurs after the student drop/add dates, which is later in the working capital cycle, as compared to direct-to-student point-of-sale transactions where cash is generally collected during the point-of-sale transaction or within a few days from the credit card processor. For our wholesale operations, cash flows from operating activities are typically a source of cash in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, as payments are received from the summer and winter selling season when they sell textbooks and other course materials for retail distribution. For both retail and wholesale, cash flows from operating activities are typically a use of cash in the fourth fiscal quarter, when sales volumes are materially lower than the other quarters. For our DSS segment, cash flows are not seasonal as cash flows from operating activities are typically consistent throughout the year. Our quarterly cash flows also may fluctuate depending on the timing of the start of the various school's semesters, as well as shifts in our fiscal calendar dates. These shifts in timing may affect the comparability of our results across periods.\nWholesale\n\u2022Product and other gross margin decreased (770 basis points), driven primarily by lower margin rates (435 basis points) due to higher markdowns, an unfavorable sales mix (370 basis points) due to lower high-margin general merchandise sales of approximately $231.2 million and the shift to lower margin digital courseware, and a merchandise inventory loss and write-off (100 basis points) of $15.0 million, comprised of a loss of $10.3 million related to the sale of our logo and emblematic general merchandise inventory below cost to FLC and an inventory write-off of $4.7 million related to our initiative to exit certain product offerings and streamline/rationalize our overall non-logo general merchandise product assortment resulting from the centralization of our merchandising decision-making during the year, partially offset by higher contract costs as a percentage of sales related to our college and university contracts (130 basis points) resulting from contract renewals and new store contracts.\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nIndex to Form 10-K Index to FS\n(b) For additional information related to the intercompany activities and eliminations, see Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 4. Segment Reporting.\nWe expect gross general merchandise sales to increase over the long term, as our product assortments continue to emphasize and reflect changing consumer trends, and we evolve our presentation concepts and merchandising of products in stores and online, which we expect to be further enhanced and accelerated through the FLC Partnership. Through this partnership, we receive unparalleled product assortment, e-commerce capabilities and powerful digital marketing tools to drive increased value for customers and accelerate growth of our logo and emblematic general merchandise business.\n(a) We identified certain out of period adjustments related primarily to Income tax benefit, as well as Restructuring and other charges, for the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021.The adjustments increased our fiscal year 2021 reported net loss by $8.0 million but did not have an impact on Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP), cash flows or liquidity. Refer to Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for further information.\nOur consolidated financial statements reflect our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d).\nThe following table summarizes our sales:\nThe following table summarizes the Retail gross margin:\n\n(d) Eliminates Wholesale sales and service fees to Retail and Retail commissions earned from Wholesale. See discussion of intercompany activities and eliminations below.\nOn March 4, 2022, we were granted a waiver to the condition to the upcoming draw under the FILO Facility, scheduled for April 2022, that Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) minus Restricted Payments (as defined in the Credit Agreement) equal at least $110.0 million. Under the waiver amendment, the commitment under the FILO Facility of $25.0 million was increased to $40.0 million, with all remaining terms unchanged.\n\nResults of Operations - 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021 (Restated) compared with the 53 weeks ended May 2, 2020\n(c)Effective April 4, 2021, as contemplated by the FLC Partnership's merchandising agreement and e-commerce agreement, we began to transition the fulfillment of logo and emblematic general merchandise sales to FLC and Fanatics. As the logo and emblematic general merchandise sales are fulfilled by FLC and Fanatics, we recognize commission revenue earned for these sales on a net basis in our consolidated financial statements, as compared to the recognition of logo and emblematic sales on a gross basis in the periods prior to April 4, 2021. For Retail Gross Comparable Store Sales details, see below.\nDSS\nProduct and other sales for Retail increased by $110.0 million, or 9.2%, to $1,306.3 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $1,196.3 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. During the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022, course material sales increased by $54.4 million or 8.1% to $710.7 million, and general merchandise sales increased by $59.0 million or 11.8% to $558.8 million, offset by a decrease in service and other revenue of $2.4 million or 6.1% to $36.8 million. Course material rental income for Retail decreased by $0.8 million, or 0.6%, to $133.4 million during the 52 weeks ended April 30, 2022 from $134.2 million during the 52 weeks ended May 1, 2021. The overall Retail sales increase is primarily related to re-opening stores that had temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. Course material sales were also impacted by lower enrollments, primarily at community colleges and by international students, and the continuation of remote and hybrid class offerings.",

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Barnes & Noble Education's business was significantly impacted by COVID-19, resulting in temporary store closures, lower foot traffic, and reduced on-campus activities. This affected comparability across fiscal years.\n\n- Total sales decreased 22.5% in FY2021 compared to FY2020, but increased 6.8% in FY2022 compared to FY2021 as stores reopened.\n\n- Gross margin decreased from 23.9% in FY2020 to 17.6% in FY2021, then increased to 24.3% in FY2022. This was impacted by merchandise inventory losses/write-offs and a shift in sales mix.\n\n- Operating loss was $176.9 million in FY2021 versus $42.8 million in FY2020 and $67.4 million in FY2022. Excluding one-time items, adjusted operating loss was 8.6% of sales in FY2021. \n\n- Net loss was $139.8 million in FY2021 compared to $38.3 million in FY2020. Adjusted net loss was $96.5 million in FY2021 versus $21.1 million in FY2020.\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA declined from $42.2 million in FY2020 to -$65.6 million in FY2021, then was -$4.8 million in FY2022.\n\n- Cash from operations was $32.9 million in FY2021 versus cash used of $8.7 million in FY2020. Cash from operations was $2.1 million in FY2022.\n\n- The company entered an important partnership with Fanatics and Lids for merchandise assortment, e-commerce and marketing.\n\nIn summary, COVID-19 severely impacted financial results in FY2021 but the business saw signs of recovery in FY2022 as stores reopened. The Fanatics partnership is a key strategic initiative."}
