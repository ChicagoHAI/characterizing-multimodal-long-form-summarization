Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of these provisions, including those relating to future events or our future financial performance and financial guidance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d might,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d project,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d intend\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology, and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These statements are only predictions. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong. Actual events or results may differ materially. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in greater detail in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nSeagen is a biotechnology company that develops and commercializes targeted therapies to treat cancer. We are commercializing ADCETRIS for the treatment of certain CD30-expressing lymphomas, PADCEV for the treatment of certain metastatic urothelial cancers, and TUKYSA for treatment of certain metastatic HER2-positive breast cancers. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients. Many of our programs, including ADCETRIS and PADCEV, are based on our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology that utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. In October 2020, we changed our corporate name from Seattle Genetics, Inc. to Seagen Inc., reflecting the global expansion of our operations.\n2020 highlights and recent developments\nCorporate\n\u2022Reported net product sales of $1 billion for full year 2020.\n\u2022Entered into oncology collaborations with Merck under which we received $725 million in upfront payments and $1 billion through an equity investment by Merck.\n\u2022Continued to make strategic investments in our pipeline, commercial launches, infrastructure, and headcount to support our future growth.\nADCETRIS\n\u2022Reported the five-year update of the phase 3 ECHELON-1 clinical trial which showed treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with AVD resulted in superior long-term outcomes when compared to ABVD, which includes bleomycin, in frontline advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\u2022Expanded clinical program including initiation of phase 3 trial in relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and expanded a trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma to evaluate stage I and II patients.\n\u2022Expanded indication approved in the European Union and first approval in China for our partner Takeda.\nPADCEV\n\u2022Commercial launch with Astellas, for patients with previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer, following FDA approval in December 2019.\n\u2022Announced positive topline results from EV-301 phase 3 trial showing that PADCEV significantly improved overall survival in previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer patients.

We expect that, going forward, our ability to maintain or continue to grow our ADCETRIS sales, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to establish or demonstrate to the medical community the value of ADCETRIS and its potential advantages compared to existing and future therapeutics in its approved indications, including in the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma indication, and the extent to which physicians make prescribing decisions with respect to ADCETRIS. Other important factors affecting our ADCETRIS sales include the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment in ADCETRIS' approved indications, the extent to which coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for ADCETRIS are available from governments and other third-party payors, the impact of any healthcare reform measures that may be upheld, or adopted in the future, including measures that could result in more rigorous coverage criteria or reduce the price that we receive for ADCETRIS, increasing competition from competing therapies including pembrolizumab in multiple indications, including in the relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma indication, impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including lower diagnosis rates, and the potential future approval of ADCETRIS in any additional indications. For these reasons, we cannot assure you that ADCETRIS sales will continue to grow or that we can maintain sales of ADCETRIS at or near current levels. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our future ADCETRIS product sales can be difficult to accurately predict from period to period.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in PADCEV is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our and Astellas' ability to successfully jointly market and commercialize PADCEV in the U.S. in its approved indication, the extent to which we and Astellas are able to obtain regulatory approvals of PADCEV in\nadditional indications in the U.S., including in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting, and in territories outside the U.S., our ability and Astellas' ability to successfully comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, including obtaining the FDA's agreement as to the confirmation of clinical benefit of PADCEV based on the results of the EV-301 clinical trial, the acceptance of PADCEV by the medical community and patients, the extent to which physicians make prescribing decisions with respect to PADCEV, the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment in PADCEV's approved indication, the duration of therapy for patients receiving PADCEV, the extent to which coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for PADCEV are available from governments and other third-party payors, the impact of any healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, including measures that could potentially result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for PADCEV, potential competition from competing therapies, the impact of conducting launch activities virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including potential negative impacts of reduced cancer diagnosis rates. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, including the lack of significant historical sales data, PADCEV sales are currently difficult to predict from period to period.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our investment in TUKYSA is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our and Merck's ability to successfully launch, market and commercialize TUKYSA in our respective territories in its approved indication, the extent to which we and Merck are able to obtain regulatory and other required governmental and pricing and reimbursement approvals of TUKYSA in additional territories, the extent to which we and Merck are able to obtain regulatory approvals of TUKYSA in additional indications, including earlier lines of breast cancer and other HER2-positive cancers, the acceptance of TUKYSA by the medical community and patients, competition from other therapies, our and Merck's ability to accurately predict and supply product demand, the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from governments and other third-party payors, our capacity to effectively commercialize a product outside of the U.S., the impact of conducting launch activities virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including potential negative impacts of reduced cancer diagnosis rates. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, including the lack of significant historical sales data, TUKYSA sales are currently difficult to predict from period to period.\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to those we market or are developing. Drug prices are under significant scrutiny and we expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. For example, in July 2020, then-President Trump announced four Executive Orders related to reducing prescription drug prices and we expect that drug pricing will continue to be subject to close scrutiny by federal, state and foreign governments. In addition to pricing actions and other measures being taken worldwide designed to reduce healthcare costs and limit the overall level of government expenditures, our sales and operations could also be affected by other risks of doing business internationally.\nWe expect that amounts received from our collaboration agreements, including royalties, will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows. These revenues and cash flows will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development, clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements, as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements.\nOur ongoing research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful. We expect that we will incur substantial expenses, and we will require significant financial resources and additional personnel in order to advance the development of, to pursue, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize our products and product candidates, and expand our pipeline. In addition, we may pursue new operations or continue the expansion of our existing operations, including with respect to our plans to build a commercial infrastructure in Europe and to otherwise continue to expand our operations internationally. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital, and our operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of such activities. We may also incur milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization.\nWe are closely evaluating the impacts of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability and the ability of our collaborators to effectively market, sell and distribute our products and to develop our products and product candidates. While our field-based personnel are engaging in limited in-person interactions, they are primarily using electronic communication, such as emails, phone calls and video conferences. Many healthcare professionals that we normally call on are working a greater proportion of their working schedule from home and are facing additional demands on their time during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We are experiencing increased competition for virtual appointments with healthcare professionals and a significant reduction in the number of interactions our sales personnel are having with physicians. We expect the different quality of electronic interactions as compared with in-person interactions, as well as the reduced quantity of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce the effectiveness of our sales personnel, as well as those of our collaborators, which could negatively affect our product sales and those of our collaborators, as well as physician awareness of our products. With respect to PADCEV and TUKYSA specifically, we have not launched a product using primarily virtual communication channels in the past and cannot predict the effects that this approach will ultimately have on demand for PADCEV or TUKYSA. However, we believe that the need to conduct these activities virtually is negatively impacting our ability to connect with key customers, including those familiar with competitive products, and our ability to conduct payor engagements. We face a number of challenges that will limit our ability to fully resume in-person interactions for the foreseeable future, including increasing COVID-19 infection rates in many states, the potential for more severe outbreaks, the need to navigate varying restrictions for entering healthcare facilities and employee childcare obligations during virtual school sessions. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve rapidly, and we may subsequently be forced to, or subsequently determine that we should, resume a more restrictive remote work model, whether as a result of further spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection or hospitalization rates or otherwise. Moreover, the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are also unknown and it is possible that following the pandemic, healthcare institutions could alter their policies with respect to in person visits by pharmaceutical company representatives. COVID-19 related restrictions could also present product distribution challenges as we utilize recently initiated distribution channels for TUKYSA. We also expect that the conversion of medical conferences to a virtual format may reduce our ability to effectively disseminate scientific information about our products, which may result in decreased physician awareness of our products, their approved indications and their efficacy and safety. The evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively affect our product sales due to challenges in patient access to healthcare settings, significant increases in unemployment and the resulting loss of individual health insurance coverage, and inability to access government healthcare programs due to backlogs, some or all of which appear to be affecting diagnosis rates and may affect side effect management, course of treatment and increase enrollment in our patient support programs. With respect to ADCETRIS specifically, impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic appear to be reducing the rate of Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses. In addition, we have experienced lower than expected levels of our research and development spending, in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes some delays in clinical trial enrollment as well as reduced travel due to the conversion of medical and scientific meetings to virtual format. While we do not at this time anticipate the need to revise our publicly reported projected clinical milestone dates as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be some impacts to our clinical study timelines, which, depending upon the duration and severity of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could ultimately delay data availability. In addition, many of our non-essential on-site research activities are currently significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may negatively impact the number of investigational new drug application, or IND, candidates entering our clinical pipeline in future years. The extent to which the risks and evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impact our business, our ability to generate sales of and revenues from our approved products, and our clinical development and regulatory efforts will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic, government actions, such as travel restrictions, quarantines and social distancing requirements in the U.S. and in other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the U.S. and in other countries to contain and treat the disease, including the effectiveness and timing of vaccine programs in the U.S. and worldwide.\nBecause of the above and other factors, our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance.\nFinancial summary\nFor 2020, our total revenues increased to $2.2 billion, compared to $916.7 million in 2019. This growth was driven by $975.2 million collaboration and license agreement revenues recognized related to the agreements we entered into with Merck during 2020, the U.S. launches of PADCEV beginning in December 2019 and TUKYSA in April 2020, respectively, as well as higher ADCETRIS net product sales.\nFor 2020, total costs and expenses increased to $1.6 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 2019. This primarily reflected higher cost of sales, higher selling, general and administrative expenses, and higher research and development expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $3.5 billion in total stockholders' equity.\nComparability\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842-Leases on January 1, 2019, resulting in a change to our accounting policy for leases. We recorded a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying assets for the applicable lease terms in our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2019. We used the modified retrospective method transition option. Accordingly, 2018 comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under previous accounting standards. For additional information, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn 2018, we acquired Cascadian for $10.00 per share in cash, or approximately $614.1 million. Cascadian was included in our results of operations as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the results discussed below were impacted by the timing of this acquisition. For additional information, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, the section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 6, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenues are comprised of ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA net product sales, amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements, and royalties. Revenue recognition occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The period between when we transfer control of promised goods or services and when we receive payment is expected to be one year or less, and that expectation is consistent with our historical experience. As such, we do not adjust our revenues for the effects of a significant financing component.\nWe apply significant judgment to our estimates in the following revenue recognition areas, each as discussed in more detail in the corresponding sections after this list:\n\u2022Net product sales - sales deductions related to government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, such as for the Medicaid and 340B programs\n\u2022Collaboration and license agreement revenues - assessing the probability of future reversal of variable consideration and evaluating whether contractual obligations represent distinct performance obligations\n\u2022Royalty revenues - estimating Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS to the extent actual information is not available\nNet product sales\nWe sell ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA through a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. We and our collaboration partner Astellas jointly promote PADCEV in the U.S. Under the joint promotion in the U.S., we record net sales of PADCEV and are responsible for all distribution through a limited number of specialty distributors. The delivery of our products represents a single performance obligation for these transactions and we record net product sales at the point in time when title and risk of loss pass. The transaction price for net product sales represents the amount we expect to receive, which is net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, estimated product returns, and other deductions. Accruals are established for these deductions, and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals. We reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor or as an accrued liability, depending on the nature of the sales deduction. Sales deductions are based on management's estimates that consider payor mix in target markets and experience to-date. These estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment. We have applied a portfolio approach as a practical expedient for estimating net product sales.\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks: We have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, or MDRA, with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This agreement provides for a rebate based on covered purchases of our products. Medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state Medicaid programs. We estimate Medicaid rebates using the expected value approach, based on a variety of factors, including payor mix and our experience to-date.\nWe have a Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement under which certain U.S. government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of our products. In addition, we have entered into a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS, to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of our products. Under these agreements, distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price. We estimate expected chargebacks for FSS and PHS purchases based on the expected value of each entity's eligibility for the FSS and PHS programs. We also review historical rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates.\nDistribution fees, product returns and other deductions: Our distributors charge a volume-based fee for distribution services that they perform for us. We allow for the return of product that is within a specified number of days of its expiration date or that is damaged. We estimate product returns based on our experience to-date using the expected value approach. We provide financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through our patient support programs. Estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance under SeaGen Secure are deducted from gross sales and are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization. These estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience.\nRoyalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect amounts earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties that relate predominantly to the license of intellectual property. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers. Takeda bears a portion of low single digit third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. This amount is included in royalty revenues. Amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to Takeda's sales of ADCETRIS are recorded in cost of sales. These amounts are recognized in the period in which the related sales by Takeda occur. Royalty revenues also reflect amounts from Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech, earned on net sales of Polivy, and amounts from GlaxoSmithKline earned on net sales of Blenrep.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nWe have collaboration and license agreements for our technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Under these agreements, we typically receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. We also are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of any resulting products incorporating our technology. Our licensees are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these collaborations, which includes the achievement of the potential milestones. Since we may not take a substantive role or control the research, development or commercialization of any products generated by some of our licensees, we may not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any potential future milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our licensees. As such, the potential future milestone payments associated with certain of our collaboration and license agreements involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received.\nCollaboration and license agreements are initially evaluated as to whether the intellectual property licenses granted by us represent distinct performance obligations. If they are determined to be distinct, the value of the intellectual property licenses would be recognized up-front while the research and development service fees would be recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Variable consideration is assessed at each reporting period as to whether it is not subject to future reversal of cumulative revenue and, therefore, should be included in the transaction price. Assessing the recognition of variable consideration requires significant judgment. If a contract includes a fixed or minimum amount of research and development support, this also would be included in the transaction price. Changes to collaboration and license agreements, such as the extensions of the research term or increasing the number of targets or technology covered under an existing agreement, are assessed for whether they represent a modification or should be accounted for as a new contract.\nWe have concluded that the license of intellectual property in certain collaboration and license agreements is not distinct from the perspective of our customers at the time of initial transfer, since we often do not license intellectual property without related technology transfer and research and development support services. Such evaluation requires significant judgment since it is made from the customer's perspective. Our performance obligations under our collaborations may include such things as providing intellectual property licenses, performing technology transfer, performing research and development consulting services, providing reagents, ADCs, and other materials, and notifying the customer of any enhancements to licensed technology or new technology that we discover, among others. We determined our performance obligations under certain collaboration and license agreements as evaluated at contract inception were not distinct and represented a single performance obligation. For those agreements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model, representing the transfer of goods or services as activities are performed over the term of the agreement. Upfront payments are also amortized to revenue over the performance period. Upfront payment contract liabilities resulting from our collaborations do not represent a financing component as the payment is not financing the transfer of goods or services, and the technology underlying the licenses granted reflects research and development expenses already incurred by us. For agreements beyond the initial performance period, we have no remaining performance obligations. We may receive license maintenance fees and potential milestones and royalties based on collaborator development and regulatory progress, which are recorded in the period achieved in the case of milestones, and during the period of the related sales for royalties.\nWhen no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue in the period the related sale occurred.\nWe generally invoice our collaborators and licensees on a monthly or quarterly basis, or upon the completion of the effort or achievement of a milestone, based on the terms of each agreement. Deferred revenue arises from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods as performance obligations are satisfied. Deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability.\nBusiness combinations, including acquired in-process research and development and goodwill. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, recording the acquisition-date fair value of total consideration over the acquisition-date fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill.\nFair value is typically estimated using an income approach based on the present value of future discounted cash flows. The significant estimates in the discounted cash flow model primarily include the discount rate, rates of future revenue growth and/or profitability of the acquired business. The discount rate considers the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the ability to achieve the projected cash flows. We may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).\nIn-process research and development assets are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and maintained on the balance sheet until either the underlying project is completed or the asset becomes impaired. If the project is completed, which generally occurs when FDA approval is obtained, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed. We periodically evaluate when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. If the asset becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nWe evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. As part of the impairment evaluation, we may elect to perform an assessment of qualitative factors. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit (for goodwill) is less than its carrying value, we then would proceed with the quantitative impairment test to compare the fair value to the carrying value and record an impairment charge if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\nAccrued Liabilities. As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we estimate accrued liabilities. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued liabilities include amounts due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials, amounts due in conjunction with manufacturing our product candidates, third-party royalties that accrue on our sales of our marketed products, and professional service fees, among other items.\nIn accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period. If the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. In the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services, our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates. The date on which some services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations. We make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time.\nLong-term Incentive Plans. We have long term incentive plans which provide eligible employees with the opportunity to receive performance-based incentive compensation, which may be comprised of cash, stock options, and/or restricted stock units. The payment of cash and the grant or vesting of equity awards are contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined regulatory milestones. We record compensation expense over the estimated service period for each milestone when we believe the milestone is considered probable, which we assess at each reporting date. Once a milestone is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that milestone, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nIncome Taxes. We have net deferred tax assets which are offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that a valuation allowance is appropriate as we have a history of net operating losses. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made, a portion of which would increase income (or decrease losses) in the period in which such a determination was made. We follow the guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the recognition of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority.\nResults of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nNet product sales\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADCETRIS </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>627,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PADCEV </td> <td> </td> <td>222,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TUKYSA </td> <td> </td> <td>119,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net product sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>627,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NM: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur net product sales grew 59% during 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily driven by recent product launches of PADCEV and TUKYSA. We began commercializing PADCEV and TUKYSA following FDA approvals in December 2019 and April 2020, respectively. ADCETRIS net product sales increased in 2020 from 2019 due to higher sales volumes and the effect of price increases during the current year period.\nWe expect growth in net product sales in 2021 from 2020 to be primarily driven by sales growth of TUKYSA and PADCEV, and to a lesser extent, ADCETRIS.\nGross-to-net deductions, net of related payments and credits, were as follows:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Rebates and\nchargebacks </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution fees,\nproduct returns\nand other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Rebates and\nchargebacks </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution fees,\nproduct returns\nand other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Rebates and\nchargebacks </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution fees,\nproduct returns\nand other </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, beginning of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,895 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision related to current year sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>358,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>386,962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>253,702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,298 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>269,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,111 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments for prior period sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(1,341) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,341) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(392) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(464) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(856) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(478) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments/credits for current year sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(319,444) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,886) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(338,330) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(217,905) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,349) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(229,254) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(155,581) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,248) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(163,829) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payments/credits for prior year sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(31,344) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,668) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(33,012) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,289) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,570) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,859) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,659) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(908) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,567) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance, end of year\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,084 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,572 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our total gross-to-net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing. These discount percentages increased during 2020 and 2019 as a result of price increases for ADCETRIS that we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation. The most significant portion of our gross-to-net accrual balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was for ADCETRIS Medicaid rebates. We expect future gross-to-net deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases, the rate of inflation, and other factors. We expect gross-to-net deductions to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020, driven by anticipated growth in our gross product sales.\nRoyalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect royalties earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers. Takeda bears third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. This amount is included in royalty revenues. Royalty revenues also reflect, to a lesser extent, amounts from Genentech earned on net sales of Polivy beginning in 2019, and amounts from GlaxoSmithKline earned on net sales of Blenrep beginning in August 2020, both of which utilizes technology that we have licensed to them.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty revenues decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to Takeda's achievement of a $40.0 million sales-based milestone during 2019, offset in part by 2020 growth in Takeda net sales of ADCETRIS in its territories, as well as higher Roche net sales of Polivy.\nWe expect that royalty revenues will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher royalties from anticipated growth in ADCETRIS sales volume by Takeda, as well as anticipated sales growth of our other licensees.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under certain of our license and collaboration agreements. These revenues reflect the earned portion of license fees, payments received by us for technology access and maintenance fees, milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support that we provide to our collaborators.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator were as follows:\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merck </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>975,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Takeda </td> <td> </td> <td>32,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>40,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration and license agreement revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,048,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>598 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NM: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues from Merck included license revenues of $725.0 million related to the collaboration agreements for LV and TUKYSA that were entered into in 2020, as well as a stock purchase premium paid by Merck of $250.1 million. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 for additional information.\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda fluctuate based on changes in the recognized portion of reimbursement funding under the ADCETRIS collaboration, which are impacted by the activities each party is performing under the collaboration agreement at a given time. For example, when Takeda's level of spending on clinical collaboration activities increases above our own, our earned portion of reimbursement funding generally decreases. Additionally, we receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use, the timing of which fluctuates based on Takeda's product supply needs. Collaboration revenues from Takeda can also fluctuate based on the achievement of milestones by Takeda. Collaboration revenues from Takeda in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily as a result of two regulatory milestones achieved in 2019 totaling $37.5 million, which were related to approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, and the completion of the Takeda performance period in November 2019.\nOther collaboration revenues declined slightly in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to recognition of $20.0 million license and collaboration agreement revenues from BeiGene, Ltd., or BeiGene, in 2019, as well as development milestones received from GSK and Genentech in 2019, offset in part by two regulatory milestones achieved by GSK and a development milestone achieved by AbbVie in 2020.\nWe expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues in 2021 to significantly decrease compared to 2020, driven by the amounts recognized related to the Merck Agreements in 2020. Our collaboration and license agreement revenues are impacted by the term and duration of those agreements and by progress-dependent milestones, annual maintenance fees, and reimbursement of materials and support services. Collaboration and license agreement revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates, the level of support we provide to our collaborators, specifically to Takeda under our ADCETRIS collaboration, the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into potential additional collaboration and license agreements.\nCollaboration agreements\nWe discuss the below arrangements in greater detail under the heading Corporate Collaborations\u201d in Part I Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTakeda ADCETRIS collaboration\nWe have an agreement with Takeda for the global co-development of ADCETRIS and the commercialization of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. We recognize payments received from Takeda, including progress-dependent development and regulatory milestone payments, reimbursement for drug supplied, and net development cost reimbursement payments, as collaboration and license agreement revenues upon transfer of control of the goods or services over the development period. When the performance of development activities under the collaboration results in us making a reimbursement payment to Takeda, that payment reduces collaboration and license agreement revenues. We also recognize royalty revenues based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS in its territories, ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers, as well as sales-based milestones. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS, which is included in royalty revenues.\nAstellas PADCEV collaboration\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Agensys, Inc., which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. Under this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development costs for PADCEV. Cost associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. Gross profit share payments owed to Astellas in the U.S. under the joint commercialization agreement are recorded in cost of sales.\nGenmab tisotumab vedotin collaboration\nWe have an agreement with Genmab to develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer, under which we previously exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin. In October 2020, we and Genmab entered into a joint commercialization agreement to govern the global commercialization of tisotumab vedotin, if we are successful in obtaining any regulatory approvals of tisotumab vedotin. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nMerck LV collaboration\nIn September 2020, we entered into the LV Agreement with a subsidiary of Merck. We are pursuing a broad joint development program evaluating LV as monotherapy and in combination settings, including with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) in triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and other LIV-1-expressing solid tumors. Under the terms of the LV Agreement, we granted Merck a co-exclusive worldwide development and commercialization license for LV, and agreed to jointly develop and commercialize LV on a worldwide basis. We received an upfront cash payment of $600.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to $850.0 million in milestone payments upon the initiation of certain clinical trials and regulatory approval in certain major markets, and up to an additional $1.8 billion in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual global net sales thresholds of LV. Each company is responsible for 50% of global costs to develop and commercialize LV and will receive 50% of potential future profits. In connection with the LV Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Merck in September 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Merck agreed to purchase 5,000,000 newly-issued shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $200 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion, referred to as the Purchase Agreement. We closed the Purchase Agreement on October 27, 2020 following the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.\nWe recognized license revenue of $850.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with the LV and Stock Purchase Agreements, and we recognize such cost sharing proportionately with the performance of the underlying activities, while recording Merck's reimbursement of our expenses as a reduction of research and development expenses.\nMerck TUKYSA collaboration\nIn September 2020, we entered into the TUKYSA Agreement with a subsidiary of Merck. We granted exclusive rights to commercialize TUKYSA in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. Under the terms of the TUKYSA Agreement, Merck is responsible for marketing applications for approval in its territory, supported by the positive results from the HER2CLIMB clinical trial. We retained commercial rights in, and will record sales in, the U.S., Canada and Europe. Merck is also co-funding a portion of the TUKYSA global development plan, which encompasses several ongoing and planned trials across HER2-positive cancers. We will continue to lead ongoing TUKYSA global development operational execution. Merck will solely fund and conduct\ncountry-specific clinical trials necessary to support anticipated regulatory applications in its territories. We received an upfront cash payment from Merck of $125.0 million and also received $85.0 million in prepaid research and development funding to be applied to Merck's global development cost sharing obligations. We are eligible to receive progress-dependent milestone payments of up to $65.0 million, and are entitled to receive tiered royalties on sales of TUKYSA by Merck that begin in the low twenty percent range and escalate based sales volume by Merck in its territory. We owe Array a portion of any non-royalty payments received from sublicensing TUKSYA rights, as well as a low double-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by us, and will owe a single-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by Merck in its territories.\nWe recognized license revenue of $125.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with the TUKYSA Agreement, and we recognize such cost sharing proportionately with the performance of the underlying activities, while recording Merck's reimbursement of our expenses as a reduction of research and development expenses. Sales of TUKYSA drug product supplied is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues. The prepayment received for global development cost-sharing was recorded as a co-development liability in accrued liabilities and other or other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As joint development expenses are incurred, we recognize the portion of Merck's prepayment as a reduction of our research and development expenses on our consolidated statements of net income (loss). As of December 31, 2020, $80.9 million was recorded as the remaining co-development liability.\nOther collaboration and license agreements\nWe have other collaboration and license agreements for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We typically receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. These amounts are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation period if the license is determined not to be distinct from other goods and services provided, or, if there is no performance obligation, upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining potential milestone payments to us under our other ADC license and collaboration agreements could total approximately $1.6 billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of their milestone events. Of this amount, approximately $0.9 billion relates to the achievement of development and regulatory milestones, and approximately $0.7 billion relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of the products that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any potential future milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator's business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result and have resulted in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its product candidates. As such, the potential future milestone payments associated with our ADC collaboration agreements involve a substantial degree of risk and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments described above, and it is possible that we may never receive any additional significant milestone payments under these agreements.\nCost of sales\nCost of sales includes manufacturing and distribution costs of product sold, gross profit share with Astellas pursuant to our PADCEV collaboration, amortization of acquired technology license costs, royalties owed on our PADCEV net product sales and global ADCETRIS and TUKSYA net product sales.\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,293 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>395 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(50) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales increased in 2020 as compared to 2019, driven by the Astellas gross profit share related to PADCEV net product sales, a payment owed to a third-party technology licensor resulting from the TUKSYA Agreement, amortization expense associated with acquired TUKSYA technology costs, and in-licensing royalties owed on PADCEV and TUKYSA net product sales. The gross profit share with Astellas totaled $104.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We recorded amortization expense of $16.3 million for acquired TUKYSA technology costs during the year ended December 31, 2020, which began following FDA approval of TUKYSA in April 2020.\nWe expect cost of sales to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result of the net product sales growth of our commercial-stage drugs. This includes cost of product sales for PADCEV and the gross profit share with Astellas under our collaboration. Growth will also be driven by the full-year 2021 amortization of acquired TUKYSA technology costs. The increase in cost of sales will also reflect expected growth in ADCETRIS net product sales. Cost of sales includes a low-single digit royalty on global net sales of ADCETRIS, a mid-single digit royalty on our net sales of PADCEV, and a low double-digit royalty on global net sales of TUKYSA. Cost of sales for PADCEV and TUKYSA in 2021 will be partially reduced by the use of product inventory that was manufactured prior to FDA approval, and previously charged to research and development expense.\nResearch and development\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and clinical development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>581,496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>497,986 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Process sciences and manufacturing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>245,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>221,388 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>827,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>719,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>565,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Certain prior year balances have been reclassified within research and development expenses to conform to current year presentation.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and clinical development expenses include personnel, occupancy and laboratory expenses, technology access fees, preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies, IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies, and external clinical trial costs including costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials. The increase in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected higher employee-related costs and external development costs mainly to support our early- and late-stage pipeline of product candidates.\nProcess sciences and manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses, manufacturing costs for the scale-up and pre-approval manufacturing of drug product used in research and our clinical trials, and costs for drug product supplied to our collaborators. Process sciences and manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities, and storage and shipment of our product candidates. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflected higher employee-related costs and external development costs primarily to support our early- and late-stage pipeline of product candidates, as well as higher costs for drug product supplied to Takeda.\nWe utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects. We track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning. We do not account for actual costs on a project basis as it relates to our infrastructure, facility, employee and other indirect costs; however, we do separately track significant third-party costs including clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project basis. To that end, the following table shows third-party costs incurred for research, contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services, as well as development milestone payments for in-licensed technology for our products\nand certain of our clinical-stage product candidates.

The cost of drug product supplied to Takeda is charged to research and development expense. We are reimbursed for the drug product, which is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nThird-party costs for TUKYSA decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower clinical supply expenses. Following the approval of TUKYSA in April 2020, we began capitalizing inventory costs manufactured for commercial sale.\nThird-party costs for PADCEV decreased slightly in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the timing of our ongoing clinical trials.\nThird-party costs for tisotumab vedotin decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the timing of our and Genmab's ongoing clinical trials.\nThird-party costs for ladiratuzumab vedotin decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower research and clinical development expenses as well as cost-sharing reimbursements received from Merck in 2020 related to the LV Agreement.\nThird-party costs for other clinical stage programs were related to multiple earlier-stage development programs and were relatively consistent across 2020 and 2019.\nOther costs and overhead include third-party costs of our preclinical programs and costs associated with personnel and facilities. These costs increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to due to the addition of new preclinical programs and higher employee-related expenses from headcount growth.\nIn order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization, the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies. We then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete. The length of time varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. We will also need to conduct additional clinical trials in order to expand labeled indications of use for our commercial products. The outcome of our clinical trials is uncertain. The cost of clinical trials may vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the number of patients enrolled, patient site costs, quantity and source of drug supply required, safety and efficacy of the product candidate, and extent of regulatory efforts, among others.\nWe anticipate that our total research and development expenses in 2021 will increase compared to 2020 primarily due to higher costs for the continued development of our approved products and product candidates.\nThe risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates, or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our products in any additional approved indications or of any of our product candidates.\nSelling, general and administrative\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>533,835 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>373,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>261,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2020 and 2019 as compared to prior years primarily due to increased field sales personnel and external spend to support our recently commercialized products, and higher infrastructure costs to support our continued growth in the U.S. and Europe.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as we continue our commercial activities in support of our products, and invest in infrastructure to support our continued growth in the U.S. and Europe.\nInvestment and other income, net\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment and other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>7,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment and other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NM: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvestment and other income, net includes other non-operating income and loss, such as unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities (which primarily include common stock holdings in Immunomedics prior to the sale of these securities in April 2020), realized gains and losses on equity and debt securities, and amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities.\nThe gain on equity securities in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a realized gain in April 2020 from the sale of our equity securities, offset in part by an unrealized loss on equity securities during the first quarter of 2020.\nInvestment income reflects amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities.

The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by $975.2 million in collaboration and license agreement revenues recognized related to the agreements we entered into with Merck during 2020.\nThe change in net cash from investing activities from 2020 as compared to 2019 reflected differences between the proceeds received from sale and maturity of our investments and amounts reinvested, and the difference for purchases of property, plant, and equipment.\nThe change in net cash from financing activities included proceeds from issuances of common stock, the exercise of options to purchase shares of our common stock, and common stock sales under our employee stock purchase plan for all years presented.\nWe primarily have financed our operations through the issuance of our common stock, collections from commercial sales of our products, amounts received pursuant to license and collaboration agreements, and royalty revenues. To a lesser degree, we also have financed our operations through investment income. These financing and revenue sources have allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held in a variety of non-interest bearing bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities, taxable municipal bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs. However, if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term, or investments do not pay at maturity, we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities, which may result in a loss. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nAt our currently planned spending rates, we believe that our existing financial resources, together with product and royalty revenues, and the fees, milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our existing collaboration and license agreements, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees, and support our development, commercialization, invest in our facilities, and expand globally, which may require us to raise additional capital. Further, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we may require significant additional capital in order to complete or otherwise provide funding for such transactions. We may seek additional capital through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations, licensing arrangements, and public or private debt or equity financings. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, our business and operations may be adversely affected.\nCommitments\nThe following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply and other agreements </td> <td> </td> <td>366,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>454,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in 2021 through 2029 that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases.

Further, a substantial portion of those non-cancelable obligations include minimum payments related to manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials and for commercial operations in the case of ADCETRIS.\nSome of our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods, profit share payments, and/or payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay royalties based on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology. Such royalties and profit share payments are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are dependent on events that have not yet occurred. Future milestone payments for research and pre-clinical stage development programs have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred, which consisted of up to approximately $2.1 billion in total potential future milestone payments to third parties under our collaboration and license agreements with these parties. These milestone payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, clinical, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. These contingent payments have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee the section Recent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Royalty revenues\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on equity securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,604 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,336 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(77) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment and other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>7,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,771 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total investment and other income, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,652 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>353 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NM: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect amounts earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties that relate predominantly to the license of intellectual property. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers. Takeda bears a portion of low single digit third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. This amount is included in royalty revenues. Amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to Takeda's sales of ADCETRIS are recorded in cost of sales. These amounts are recognized in the period in which the related sales by Takeda occur. Royalty revenues also reflect amounts from Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech, earned on net sales of Polivy, and amounts from GlaxoSmithKline earned on net sales of Blenrep.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>138,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,440 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>66 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe generated pre-tax income of $615.7 million in 2020 as the result of the Merck agreements entered into during 2020.

or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nResearch and clinical development expenses include personnel, occupancy and laboratory expenses, technology access fees, preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies, IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies, and external clinical trial costs including costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials. The increase in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected higher employee-related costs and external development costs mainly to support our early- and late-stage pipeline of product candidates.\nWe expect cost of sales to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result of the net product sales growth of our commercial-stage drugs. This includes cost of product sales for PADCEV and the gross profit share with Astellas under our collaboration. Growth will also be driven by the full-year 2021 amortization of acquired TUKYSA technology costs. The increase in cost of sales will also reflect expected growth in ADCETRIS net product sales. Cost of sales includes a low-single digit royalty on global net sales of ADCETRIS, a mid-single digit royalty on our net sales of PADCEV, and a low double-digit royalty on global net sales of TUKYSA. Cost of sales for PADCEV and TUKYSA in 2021 will be partially reduced by the use of product inventory that was manufactured prior to FDA approval, and previously charged to research and development expense.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merck </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>975,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Takeda </td> <td> </td> <td>32,107 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,605 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>40,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,070 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration and license agreement revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,048,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>150,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>598 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NM: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognized license revenue of $125.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with the TUKYSA Agreement, and we recognize such cost sharing proportionately with the performance of the underlying activities, while recording Merck's reimbursement of our expenses as a reduction of research and development expenses.

Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nThe change in net cash from investing activities from 2020 as compared to 2019 reflected differences between the proceeds received from sale and maturity of our investments and amounts reinvested, and the difference for purchases of property, plant, and equipment.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ADCETRIS </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>627,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PADCEV </td> <td> </td> <td>222,436 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>TUKYSA </td> <td> </td> <td>119,585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> <td> </td> <td>NM </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net product sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,000,598 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>627,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NM: No amount in comparable period or not a meaningful comparison.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining potential milestone payments to us under our other ADC license and collaboration agreements could total approximately $1.6 billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of their milestone events. Of this amount, approximately $0.9 billion relates to the achievement of development and regulatory milestones, and approximately $0.7 billion relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of the products that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any potential future milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator's business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result and have resulted in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its product candidates. As such, the potential future milestone payments associated with our ADC collaboration agreements involve a substantial degree of risk and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments described above, and it is possible that we may never receive any additional significant milestone payments under these agreements.\n\u2022Commercial launch with Astellas, for patients with previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer, following FDA approval in December 2019.\nSee the section Recent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022Received breakthrough therapy designation in first-line advanced urothelial cancer for PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab.\nBecause of the above and other factors, our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,510 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply and other agreements </td> <td> </td> <td>366,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>454,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>157,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,326 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis.

As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we estimate accrued liabilities. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued liabilities include amounts due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials, amounts due in conjunction with manufacturing our product candidates, third-party royalties that accrue on our sales of our marketed products, and professional service fees, among other items.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as we continue our commercial activities in support of our products, and invest in infrastructure to support our continued growth in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn-process research and development assets are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and maintained on the balance sheet until either the underlying project is completed or the asset becomes impaired. If the project is completed, which generally occurs when FDA approval is obtained, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed. We periodically evaluate when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. If the asset becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nWe anticipate that our total research and development expenses in 2021 will increase compared to 2020 primarily due to higher costs for the continued development of our approved products and product candidates.\n\nThird-party costs for other clinical stage programs were related to multiple earlier-stage development programs and were relatively consistent across 2020 and 2019.\nWe recognized license revenue of $850.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with the LV and Stock Purchase Agreements, and we recognize such cost sharing proportionately with the performance of the underlying activities, while recording Merck's reimbursement of our expenses as a reduction of research and development expenses.\n\nWe expect that amounts received from our collaboration agreements, including royalties, will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows. These revenues and cash flows will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development, clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements, as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements.\n\u2022Royalty revenues - estimating Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS to the extent actual information is not available\nWe generally invoice our collaborators and licensees on a monthly or quarterly basis, or upon the completion of the effort or achievement of a milestone, based on the terms of each agreement. Deferred revenue arises from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods as performance obligations are satisfied. Deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability.\nSelling, general and administrative\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks: We have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, or MDRA, with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This agreement provides for a rebate based on covered purchases of our products. Medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state Medicaid programs. We estimate Medicaid rebates using the expected value approach, based on a variety of factors, including payor mix and our experience to-date.\n\nFor 2020, our total revenues increased to $2.2 billion, compared to $916.7 million in 2019. This growth was driven by $975.2 million collaboration and license agreement revenues recognized related to the agreements we entered into with Merck during 2020, the U.S. launches of PADCEV beginning in December 2019 and TUKYSA in April 2020, respectively, as well as higher ADCETRIS net product sales.\nAlso refer to Part I Item 1 Business\u201d for more information about our products, pipeline, technologies, research programs, and future plans for our clinical programs, including recent key business achievements.\nadditional indications in the U.S., including in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting, and in territories outside the U.S., our ability and Astellas' ability to successfully comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, including obtaining the FDA's agreement as to the confirmation of clinical benefit of PADCEV based on the results of the EV-301 clinical trial, the acceptance of PADCEV by the medical community and patients, the extent to which physicians make prescribing decisions with respect to PADCEV, the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment in PADCEV's approved indication, the duration of therapy for patients receiving PADCEV, the extent to which coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for PADCEV are available from governments and other third-party payors, the impact of any healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, including measures that could potentially result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for PADCEV, potential competition from competing therapies, the impact of conducting launch activities virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including potential negative impacts of reduced cancer diagnosis rates. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, including the lack of significant historical sales data, PADCEV sales are currently difficult to predict from period to period.\nWe utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects. We track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning. We do not account for actual costs on a project basis as it relates to our infrastructure, facility, employee and other indirect costs; however, we do separately track significant third-party costs including clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project basis. To that end, the following table shows third-party costs incurred for research, contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services, as well as development milestone payments for in-licensed technology for our products\nADCETRIS\nWe sell ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA through a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. We and our collaboration partner Astellas jointly promote PADCEV in the U.S. Under the joint promotion in the U.S., we record net sales of PADCEV and are responsible for all distribution through a limited number of specialty distributors. The delivery of our products represents a single performance obligation for these transactions and we record net product sales at the point in time when title and risk of loss pass. The transaction price for net product sales represents the amount we expect to receive, which is net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, estimated product returns, and other deductions. Accruals are established for these deductions, and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals. We reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor or as an accrued liability, depending on the nature of the sales deduction. Sales deductions are based on management's estimates that consider payor mix in target markets and experience to-date. These estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment. We have applied a portfolio approach as a practical expedient for estimating net product sales.\n\u2022Reported net product sales of $1 billion for full year 2020.\nWe have other collaboration and license agreements for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We typically receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. These amounts are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation period if the license is determined not to be distinct from other goods and services provided, or, if there is no performance obligation, upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer.\nWe have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in 2021 through 2029 that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases. Operating lease obligations in the table above do not assume the exercise by us of any extension options.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBusiness combinations, including acquired in-process research and development and goodwill. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, recording the acquisition-date fair value of total consideration over the acquisition-date fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill.\nInvestment and other income, net includes other non-operating income and loss, such as unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities (which primarily include common stock holdings in Immunomedics prior to the sale of these securities in April 2020), realized gains and losses on equity and debt securities, and amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe expect growth in net product sales in 2021 from 2020 to be primarily driven by sales growth of TUKYSA and PADCEV, and to a lesser extent, ADCETRIS.\nResearch and development\nThird-party costs for ladiratuzumab vedotin decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower research and clinical development expenses as well as cost-sharing reimbursements received from Merck in 2020 related to the LV Agreement.\nMerck LV collaboration\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator were as follows:\nWe primarily have financed our operations through the issuance of our common stock, collections from commercial sales of our products, amounts received pursuant to license and collaboration agreements, and royalty revenues. To a lesser degree, we also have financed our operations through investment income. These financing and revenue sources have allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments.\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect royalties earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers. Takeda bears third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. This amount is included in royalty revenues. Royalty revenues also reflect, to a lesser extent, amounts from Genentech earned on net sales of Polivy beginning in 2019, and amounts from GlaxoSmithKline earned on net sales of Blenrep beginning in August 2020, both of which utilizes technology that we have licensed to them.\nOur ongoing research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful. We expect that we will incur substantial expenses, and we will require significant financial resources and additional personnel in order to advance the development of, to pursue, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize our products and product candidates, and expand our pipeline. In addition, we may pursue new operations or continue the expansion of our existing operations, including with respect to our plans to build a commercial infrastructure in Europe and to otherwise continue to expand our operations internationally. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital, and our operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of such activities. We may also incur milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization.\n2020 highlights and recent developments\n\u2022Entered into a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Merck for our drug candidate ladiratuzumab vedotin.\nThe gain on equity securities in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a realized gain in April 2020 from the sale of our equity securities, offset in part by an unrealized loss on equity securities during the first quarter of 2020.\nFair value is typically estimated using an income approach based on the present value of future discounted cash flows. The significant estimates in the discounted cash flow model primarily include the discount rate, rates of future revenue growth and/or profitability of the acquired business. The discount rate considers the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the ability to achieve the projected cash flows. We may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).\nOverview\nWe discuss the below arrangements in greater detail under the heading Corporate Collaborations\u201d in Part I Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022Collaboration and license agreement revenues - assessing the probability of future reversal of variable consideration and evaluating whether contractual obligations represent distinct performance obligations\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees, and support our development, commercialization, invest in our facilities, and expand globally, which may require us to raise additional capital. Further, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we may require significant additional capital in order to complete or otherwise provide funding for such transactions. We may seek additional capital through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations, licensing arrangements, and public or private debt or equity financings. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, our business and operations may be adversely affected.\nPipeline\nRoyalty revenues decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to Takeda's achievement of a $40.0 million sales-based milestone during 2019, offset in part by 2020 growth in Takeda net sales of ADCETRIS in its territories, as well as higher Roche net sales of Polivy.\nMerck TUKYSA collaboration\n\u2022Announced positive results from tisotumab vedotin pivotal trial in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Data used to support approval application submitted in the U.S. in February 2021.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to those we market or are developing. Drug prices are under significant scrutiny and we expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. For example, in July 2020, then-President Trump announced four Executive Orders related to reducing prescription drug prices and we expect that drug pricing will continue to be subject to close scrutiny by federal, state and foreign governments. In addition to pricing actions and other measures being taken worldwide designed to reduce healthcare costs and limit the overall level of government expenditures, our sales and operations could also be affected by other risks of doing business internationally.\nThe following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nThird-party costs for TUKYSA decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower clinical supply expenses. Following the approval of TUKYSA in April 2020, we began capitalizing inventory costs manufactured for commercial sale.\n\u2022Continued to make strategic investments in our pipeline, commercial launches, infrastructure, and headcount to support our future growth.\nOther costs and overhead include third-party costs of our preclinical programs and costs associated with personnel and facilities. These costs increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to due to the addition of new preclinical programs and higher employee-related expenses from headcount growth.\nThird-party costs for PADCEV decreased slightly in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the timing of our ongoing clinical trials.\nIn 2018, we acquired Cascadian for $10.00 per share in cash, or approximately $614.1 million. Cascadian was included in our results of operations as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the results discussed below were impacted by the timing of this acquisition. For additional information, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComparability\n\nWe expect that royalty revenues will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher royalties from anticipated growth in ADCETRIS sales volume by Takeda, as well as anticipated sales growth of our other licensees.\n\u2022Entered into exclusive license and co-development agreement with Merck to commercialize TUKYSA in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe.\nLiquidity and capital resources\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements\ncountry-specific clinical trials necessary to support anticipated regulatory applications in its territories. We received an upfront cash payment from Merck of $125.0 million and also received $85.0 million in prepaid research and development funding to be applied to Merck's global development cost sharing obligations. We are eligible to receive progress-dependent milestone payments of up to $65.0 million, and are entitled to receive tiered royalties on sales of TUKYSA by Merck that begin in the low twenty percent range and escalate based sales volume by Merck in its territory. We owe Array a portion of any non-royalty payments received from sublicensing TUKSYA rights, as well as a low double-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by us, and will owe a single-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by Merck in its territories.\n\n\u2022Received marketing authorization in the European Union in February 2021.\nOur net product sales grew 59% during 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily driven by recent product launches of PADCEV and TUKYSA. We began commercializing PADCEV and TUKYSA following FDA approvals in December 2019 and April 2020, respectively. ADCETRIS net product sales increased in 2020 from 2019 due to higher sales volumes and the effect of price increases during the current year period.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenues are comprised of ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA net product sales, amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements, and royalties. Revenue recognition occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The period between when we transfer control of promised goods or services and when we receive payment is expected to be one year or less, and that expectation is consistent with our historical experience. As such, we do not adjust our revenues for the effects of a significant financing component.\nResults of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda fluctuate based on changes in the recognized portion of reimbursement funding under the ADCETRIS collaboration, which are impacted by the activities each party is performing under the collaboration agreement at a given time. For example, when Takeda's level of spending on clinical collaboration activities increases above our own, our earned portion of reimbursement funding generally decreases. Additionally, we receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use, the timing of which fluctuates based on Takeda's product supply needs. Collaboration revenues from Takeda can also fluctuate based on the achievement of milestones by Takeda. Collaboration revenues from Takeda in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily as a result of two regulatory milestones achieved in 2019 totaling $37.5 million, which were related to approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, and the completion of the Takeda performance period in November 2019.\n\u2022Expanded clinical program including initiation of phase 3 trial in relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and expanded a trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma to evaluate stage I and II patients.\nand certain of our clinical-stage product candidates. The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of third-party costs for our preclinical stage programs, as well as personnel, facilities, manufacturing, and other indirect costs not directly charged to development programs.\n\n\u2022Announced positive topline results from EV-301 phase 3 trial showing that PADCEV significantly improved overall survival in previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer patients. Data to support global marketing applications.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $3.5 billion in total stockholders' equity.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our investment in TUKYSA is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our and Merck's ability to successfully launch, market and commercialize TUKYSA in our respective territories in its approved indication, the extent to which we and Merck are able to obtain regulatory and other required governmental and pricing and reimbursement approvals of TUKYSA in additional territories, the extent to which we and Merck are able to obtain regulatory approvals of TUKYSA in additional indications, including earlier lines of breast cancer and other HER2-positive cancers, the acceptance of TUKYSA by the medical community and patients, competition from other therapies, our and Merck's ability to accurately predict and supply product demand, the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from governments and other third-party payors, our capacity to effectively commercialize a product outside of the U.S., the impact of conducting launch activities virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including potential negative impacts of reduced cancer diagnosis rates. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, including the lack of significant historical sales data, TUKYSA sales are currently difficult to predict from period to period.\nThird-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to increased activities associated with our ongoing ADCETRIS clinical trials. The cost of drug product supplied to Takeda is charged to research and development expense. We are reimbursed for the drug product, which is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held in a variety of non-interest bearing bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities, taxable municipal bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs. However, if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term, or investments do not pay at maturity, we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities, which may result in a loss. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates, or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our products in any additional approved indications or of any of our product candidates.\nCollaboration and license agreements are initially evaluated as to whether the intellectual property licenses granted by us represent distinct performance obligations. If they are determined to be distinct, the value of the intellectual property licenses would be recognized up-front while the research and development service fees would be recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Variable consideration is assessed at each reporting period as to whether it is not subject to future reversal of cumulative revenue and, therefore, should be included in the transaction price. Assessing the recognition of variable consideration requires significant judgment. If a contract includes a fixed or minimum amount of research and development support, this also would be included in the transaction price. Changes to collaboration and license agreements, such as the extensions of the research term or increasing the number of targets or technology covered under an existing agreement, are assessed for whether they represent a modification or should be accounted for as a new contract.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2020 and 2019 as compared to prior years primarily due to increased field sales personnel and external spend to support our recently commercialized products, and higher infrastructure costs to support our continued growth in the U.S. and Europe.\nWhen no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue in the period the related sale occurred.\nSome of our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods, profit share payments, and/or payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay royalties based on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology. Such royalties and profit share payments are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are dependent on events that have not yet occurred. Future milestone payments for research and pre-clinical stage development programs have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred, which consisted of up to approximately $2.1 billion in total potential future milestone payments to third parties under our collaboration and license agreements with these parties. These milestone payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, clinical, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. These contingent payments have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred.\n\nIncome taxes\nIn order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization, the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies. We then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete. The length of time varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. We will also need to conduct additional clinical trials in order to expand labeled indications of use for our commercial products. The outcome of our clinical trials is uncertain. The cost of clinical trials may vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the number of patients enrolled, patient site costs, quantity and source of drug supply required, safety and efficacy of the product candidate, and extent of regulatory efforts, among others.\nWe are closely evaluating the impacts of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability and the ability of our collaborators to effectively market, sell and distribute our products and to develop our products and product candidates. While our field-based personnel are engaging in limited in-person interactions, they are primarily using electronic communication, such as emails, phone calls and video conferences. Many healthcare professionals that we normally call on are working a greater proportion of their working schedule from home and are facing additional demands on their time during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We are experiencing increased competition for virtual appointments with healthcare professionals and a significant reduction in the number of interactions our sales personnel are having with physicians. We expect the different quality of electronic interactions as compared with in-person interactions, as well as the reduced quantity of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce the effectiveness of our sales personnel, as well as those of our collaborators, which could negatively affect our product sales and those of our collaborators, as well as physician awareness of our products. With respect to PADCEV and TUKYSA specifically, we have not launched a product using primarily virtual communication channels in the past and cannot predict the effects that this approach will ultimately have on demand for PADCEV or TUKYSA. However, we believe that the need to conduct these activities virtually is negatively impacting our ability to connect with key customers, including those familiar with competitive products, and our ability to conduct payor engagements. We face a number of challenges that will limit our ability to fully resume in-person interactions for the foreseeable future, including increasing COVID-19 infection rates in many states, the potential for more severe outbreaks, the need to navigate varying restrictions for entering healthcare facilities and employee childcare obligations during virtual school sessions. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve rapidly, and we may subsequently be forced to, or subsequently determine that we should, resume a more restrictive remote work model, whether as a result of further spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection or hospitalization rates or otherwise. Moreover, the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are also unknown and it is possible that following the pandemic, healthcare institutions could alter their policies with respect to in person visits by pharmaceutical company representatives. COVID-19 related restrictions could also present product distribution challenges as we utilize recently initiated distribution channels for TUKYSA. We also expect that the conversion of medical conferences to a virtual format may reduce our ability to effectively disseminate scientific information about our products, which may result in decreased physician awareness of our products, their approved indications and their efficacy and safety. The evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively affect our product sales due to challenges in patient access to healthcare settings, significant increases in unemployment and the resulting loss of individual health insurance coverage, and inability to access government healthcare programs due to backlogs, some or all of which appear to be affecting diagnosis rates and may affect side effect management, course of treatment and increase enrollment in our patient support programs. With respect to ADCETRIS specifically, impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic appear to be reducing the rate of Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses. In addition, we have experienced lower than expected levels of our research and development spending, in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes some delays in clinical trial enrollment as well as reduced travel due to the conversion of medical and scientific meetings to virtual format. While we do not at this time anticipate the need to revise our publicly reported projected clinical milestone dates as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be some impacts to our clinical study timelines, which, depending upon the duration and severity of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could ultimately delay data availability. In addition, many of our non-essential on-site research activities are currently significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may negatively impact the number of investigational new drug application, or IND, candidates entering our clinical pipeline in future years. The extent to which the risks and evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impact our business, our ability to generate sales of and revenues from our approved products, and our clinical development and regulatory efforts will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic, government actions, such as travel restrictions, quarantines and social distancing requirements in the U.S. and in other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the U.S. and in other countries to contain and treat the disease, including the effectiveness and timing of vaccine programs in the U.S. and worldwide.\nInvestment income reflects amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities. Investment income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to due to lower average yields on our investment portfolio during 2020.\nCommitments\nFinancial summary\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Agensys, Inc., which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. Under this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development costs for PADCEV. Cost associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. Gross profit share payments owed to Astellas in the U.S. under the joint commercialization agreement are recorded in cost of sales.\nCost of sales\nCollaboration agreements\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in PADCEV is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our and Astellas' ability to successfully jointly market and commercialize PADCEV in the U.S. in its approved indication, the extent to which we and Astellas are able to obtain regulatory approvals of PADCEV in\nIn addition, the section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 6, 2020.\n\u2022Commercial launch following FDA approval for patients with previously treated metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases in April 2020.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues from Merck included license revenues of $725.0 million related to the collaboration agreements for LV and TUKYSA that were entered into in 2020, as well as a stock purchase premium paid by Merck of $250.1 million. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 for additional information.\nProcess sciences and manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses, manufacturing costs for the scale-up and pre-approval manufacturing of drug product used in research and our clinical trials, and costs for drug product supplied to our collaborators. Process sciences and manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities, and storage and shipment of our product candidates. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflected higher employee-related costs and external development costs primarily to support our early- and late-stage pipeline of product candidates, as well as higher costs for drug product supplied to Takeda.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under certain of our license and collaboration agreements. These revenues reflect the earned portion of license fees, payments received by us for technology access and maintenance fees, milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support that we provide to our collaborators.\nIncome Taxes. We have net deferred tax assets which are offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that a valuation allowance is appropriate as we have a history of net operating losses. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made, a portion of which would increase income (or decrease losses) in the period in which such a determination was made. We follow the guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the recognition of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority.\n\n\u2022Reported the five-year update of the phase 3 ECHELON-1 clinical trial which showed treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with AVD resulted in superior long-term outcomes when compared to ABVD, which includes bleomycin, in frontline advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.\nSeagen is a biotechnology company that develops and commercializes targeted therapies to treat cancer. We are commercializing ADCETRIS for the treatment of certain CD30-expressing lymphomas, PADCEV for the treatment of certain metastatic urothelial cancers, and TUKYSA for treatment of certain metastatic HER2-positive breast cancers. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients. Many of our programs, including ADCETRIS and PADCEV, are based on our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology that utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. In October 2020, we changed our corporate name from Seattle Genetics, Inc. to Seagen Inc., reflecting the global expansion of our operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of these provisions, including those relating to future events or our future financial performance and financial guidance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d might,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d project,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d intend\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology, and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These statements are only predictions. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong. Actual events or results may differ materially. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in greater detail in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.\nWe have collaboration and license agreements for our technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Under these agreements, we typically receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. We also are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of any resulting products incorporating our technology. Our licensees are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these collaborations, which includes the achievement of the potential milestones. Since we may not take a substantive role or control the research, development or commercialization of any products generated by some of our licensees, we may not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any potential future milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our licensees. As such, the potential future milestone payments associated with certain of our collaboration and license agreements involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received.\nInvestment and other income, net\nIn September 2020, we entered into the LV Agreement with a subsidiary of Merck. We are pursuing a broad joint development program evaluating LV as monotherapy and in combination settings, including with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) in triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and other LIV-1-expressing solid tumors. Under the terms of the LV Agreement, we granted Merck a co-exclusive worldwide development and commercialization license for LV, and agreed to jointly develop and commercialize LV on a worldwide basis. We received an upfront cash payment of $600.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to $850.0 million in milestone payments upon the initiation of certain clinical trials and regulatory approval in certain major markets, and up to an additional $1.8 billion in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual global net sales thresholds of LV. Each company is responsible for 50% of global costs to develop and commercialize LV and will receive 50% of potential future profits. In connection with the LV Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Merck in September 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Merck agreed to purchase 5,000,000 newly-issued shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $200 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion, referred to as the Purchase Agreement. We closed the Purchase Agreement on October 27, 2020 following the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.\nWe expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues in 2021 to significantly decrease compared to 2020, driven by the amounts recognized related to the Merck Agreements in 2020. Our collaboration and license agreement revenues are impacted by the term and duration of those agreements and by progress-dependent milestones, annual maintenance fees, and reimbursement of materials and support services. Collaboration and license agreement revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates, the level of support we provide to our collaborators, specifically to Takeda under our ADCETRIS collaboration, the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into potential additional collaboration and license agreements.\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our total gross-to-net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing. These discount percentages increased during 2020 and 2019 as a result of price increases for ADCETRIS that we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation. The most significant portion of our gross-to-net accrual balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was for ADCETRIS Medicaid rebates. We expect future gross-to-net deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases, the rate of inflation, and other factors. We expect gross-to-net deductions to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020, driven by anticipated growth in our gross product sales.\nCorporate\nThird-party costs for tisotumab vedotin decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the timing of our and Genmab's ongoing clinical trials.\nAstellas PADCEV collaboration\n\nWe have concluded that the license of intellectual property in certain collaboration and license agreements is not distinct from the perspective of our customers at the time of initial transfer, since we often do not license intellectual property without related technology transfer and research and development support services. Such evaluation requires significant judgment since it is made from the customer's perspective. Our performance obligations under our collaborations may include such things as providing intellectual property licenses, performing technology transfer, performing research and development consulting services, providing reagents, ADCs, and other materials, and notifying the customer of any enhancements to licensed technology or new technology that we discover, among others. We determined our performance obligations under certain collaboration and license agreements as evaluated at contract inception were not distinct and represented a single performance obligation. For those agreements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model, representing the transfer of goods or services as activities are performed over the term of the agreement. Upfront payments are also amortized to revenue over the performance period. Upfront payment contract liabilities resulting from our collaborations do not represent a financing component as the payment is not financing the transfer of goods or services, and the technology underlying the licenses granted reflects research and development expenses already incurred by us. For agreements beyond the initial performance period, we have no remaining performance obligations. We may receive license maintenance fees and potential milestones and royalties based on collaborator development and regulatory progress, which are recorded in the period achieved in the case of milestones, and during the period of the related sales for royalties.\nFor 2020, total costs and expenses increased to $1.6 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 2019. This primarily reflected higher cost of sales, higher selling, general and administrative expenses, and higher research and development expenses.\nLong-term Incentive Plans. We have long term incentive plans which provide eligible employees with the opportunity to receive performance-based incentive compensation, which may be comprised of cash, stock options, and/or restricted stock units. The payment of cash and the grant or vesting of equity awards are contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined regulatory milestones. We record compensation expense over the estimated service period for each milestone when we believe the milestone is considered probable, which we assess at each reporting date. Once a milestone is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that milestone, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nThe change in net cash from operating activities from 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily was related to the change in our net income (loss), working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by $975.2 million in collaboration and license agreement revenues recognized related to the agreements we entered into with Merck during 2020.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842-Leases on January 1, 2019, resulting in a change to our accounting policy for leases. We recorded a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying assets for the applicable lease terms in our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2019. We used the modified retrospective method transition option. Accordingly, 2018 comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under previous accounting standards. For additional information, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross-to-net deductions, net of related payments and credits, were as follows:\n\u2022Net product sales - sales deductions related to government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, such as for the Medicaid and 340B programs\nWe apply significant judgment to our estimates in the following revenue recognition areas, each as discussed in more detail in the corresponding sections after this list:\nIn September 2020, we entered into the TUKYSA Agreement with a subsidiary of Merck. We granted exclusive rights to commercialize TUKYSA in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. Under the terms of the TUKYSA Agreement, Merck is responsible for marketing applications for approval in its territory, supported by the positive results from the HER2CLIMB clinical trial. We retained commercial rights in, and will record sales in, the U.S., Canada and Europe. Merck is also co-funding a portion of the TUKYSA global development plan, which encompasses several ongoing and planned trials across HER2-positive cancers. We will continue to lead ongoing TUKYSA global development operational execution. Merck will solely fund and conduct\nTakeda ADCETRIS collaboration\nWe did not generate pre-tax income during 2019 or 2018. In 2018, we recognized a deferred tax liability of $23.7 million on acquired intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of Cascadian. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $23.7 million for the release of valuation allowance on our existing U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the offset of deferred tax liabilities established for intangible assets from the acquisition.\n\u2022Expanded indication approved in the European Union and first approval in China for our partner Takeda.\nNet product sales\nWe have a Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement under which certain U.S. government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of our products. In addition, we have entered into a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS, to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of our products. Under these agreements, distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price. We estimate expected chargebacks for FSS and PHS purchases based on the expected value of each entity's eligibility for the FSS and PHS programs. We also review historical rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates.\nCost of sales includes manufacturing and distribution costs of product sold, gross profit share with Astellas pursuant to our PADCEV collaboration, amortization of acquired technology license costs, royalties owed on our PADCEV net product sales and global ADCETRIS and TUKSYA net product sales.\n\u2022Received ex-U.S. regulatory approvals in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland under the Project Orbis initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence.\nThe change in net cash from financing activities included proceeds from issuances of common stock, the exercise of options to purchase shares of our common stock, and common stock sales under our employee stock purchase plan for all years presented.\n\u2022Initiated phase 1 trials of two novel drug candidates, SGN-B6A and SEA-TGT.\nOther collaboration and license agreements\nWe recognize revenue from ADCETRIS product sales in the U.S. and Canada, and PADCEV and TUKYSA products sales in the U.S. While we anticipate that sales of ADCETRIS will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020, we have experienced and expect continued impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which appear to be reducing the rate of Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses, and an increase in gross-to-net deductions that we believe is due to a shift in the locations where ADCETRIS is administered, which has increased the proportion of ADCETRIS sales through the federal 340B drug discount program. We expect that, going forward, our ability to maintain or continue to grow our ADCETRIS sales, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to establish or demonstrate to the medical community the value of ADCETRIS and its potential advantages compared to existing and future therapeutics in its approved indications, including in the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma indication, and the extent to which physicians make prescribing decisions with respect to ADCETRIS. Other important factors affecting our ADCETRIS sales include the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment in ADCETRIS' approved indications, the extent to which coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for ADCETRIS are available from governments and other third-party payors, the impact of any healthcare reform measures that may be upheld, or adopted in the future, including measures that could result in more rigorous coverage criteria or reduce the price that we receive for ADCETRIS, increasing competition from competing therapies including pembrolizumab in multiple indications, including in the relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma indication, impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including lower diagnosis rates, and the potential future approval of ADCETRIS in any additional indications. For these reasons, we cannot assure you that ADCETRIS sales will continue to grow or that we can maintain sales of ADCETRIS at or near current levels. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our future ADCETRIS product sales can be difficult to accurately predict from period to period.\nGenmab tisotumab vedotin collaboration\n\u2022Entered into oncology collaborations with Merck under which we received $725 million in upfront payments and $1 billion through an equity investment by Merck.\nIn accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period. If the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. In the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services, our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates. The date on which some services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations. We make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time.\nTUKYSA\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOutlook\nAt our currently planned spending rates, we believe that our existing financial resources, together with product and royalty revenues, and the fees, milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our existing collaboration and license agreements, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\n\u2022Announced positive topline results from second cohort of EV-201 pivotal trial. Data to support additional indication in the U.S.", "item_7_text": "Royalty revenues\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect amounts earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties that relate predominantly to the license of intellectual property. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers. Takeda bears a portion of low single digit third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. This amount is included in royalty revenues. Amounts owed to our third-party licensors related to Takeda's sales of ADCETRIS are recorded in cost of sales. These amounts are recognized in the period in which the related sales by Takeda occur. Royalty revenues also reflect amounts from Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech, earned on net sales of Polivy, and amounts from GlaxoSmithKline earned on net sales of Blenrep.\nWe generated pre-tax income of $615.7 million in 2020 as the result of the Merck agreements entered into during 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $2.0 million, consisting primarily of current state income taxes. We utilized net operating loss carryforwards to offset the federal tax liability.\nWe have an agreement with Takeda for the global co-development of ADCETRIS and the commercialization of ADCETRIS by Takeda in its territory. We recognize payments received from Takeda, including progress-dependent development and regulatory milestone payments, reimbursement for drug supplied, and net development cost reimbursement payments, as collaboration and license agreement revenues upon transfer of control of the goods or services over the development period. When the performance of development activities under the collaboration results in us making a reimbursement payment to Takeda, that payment reduces collaboration and license agreement revenues. We also recognize royalty revenues based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS in its territories, ranging from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers, as well as sales-based milestones. Takeda bears a portion of third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS, which is included in royalty revenues.\nNet product sales\n\u2022Initiated EV-302 phase 3 trial in first-line metastatic urothelial cancer in combination with pembrolizumab.\nOther collaboration revenues declined slightly in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to recognition of $20.0 million license and collaboration agreement revenues from BeiGene, Ltd., or BeiGene, in 2019, as well as development milestones received from GSK and Genentech in 2019, offset in part by two regulatory milestones achieved by GSK and a development milestone achieved by AbbVie in 2020.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, requires us to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nResearch and clinical development expenses include personnel, occupancy and laboratory expenses, technology access fees, preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies, IND-enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies, and external clinical trial costs including costs for clinical sites, clinical research organizations, contractors and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials. The increase in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily reflected higher employee-related costs and external development costs mainly to support our early- and late-stage pipeline of product candidates.\nWe expect cost of sales to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result of the net product sales growth of our commercial-stage drugs. This includes cost of product sales for PADCEV and the gross profit share with Astellas under our collaboration. Growth will also be driven by the full-year 2021 amortization of acquired TUKYSA technology costs. The increase in cost of sales will also reflect expected growth in ADCETRIS net product sales. Cost of sales includes a low-single digit royalty on global net sales of ADCETRIS, a mid-single digit royalty on our net sales of PADCEV, and a low double-digit royalty on global net sales of TUKYSA. Cost of sales for PADCEV and TUKYSA in 2021 will be partially reduced by the use of product inventory that was manufactured prior to FDA approval, and previously charged to research and development expense.\nWe recognized license revenue of $125.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with the TUKYSA Agreement, and we recognize such cost sharing proportionately with the performance of the underlying activities, while recording Merck's reimbursement of our expenses as a reduction of research and development expenses. Sales of TUKYSA drug product supplied is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues. The prepayment received for global development cost-sharing was recorded as a co-development liability in accrued liabilities and other or other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As joint development expenses are incurred, we recognize the portion of Merck's prepayment as a reduction of our research and development expenses on our consolidated statements of net income (loss). As of December 31, 2020, $80.9 million was recorded as the remaining co-development liability.\nPADCEV\nDistribution fees, product returns and other deductions: Our distributors charge a volume-based fee for distribution services that they perform for us. We allow for the return of product that is within a specified number of days of its expiration date or that is damaged. We estimate product returns based on our experience to-date using the expected value approach. We provide financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through our patient support programs. Estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance under SeaGen Secure are deducted from gross sales and are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization. These estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience.\nSupply and other agreements primarily include non-cancelable obligations under our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements. Further, a substantial portion of those non-cancelable obligations include minimum payments related to manufacturing our product candidates for use in our clinical trials and for commercial operations in the case of ADCETRIS.\nWe evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually, as of October 1, or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. As part of the impairment evaluation, we may elect to perform an assessment of qualitative factors. If this qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset or the reporting unit (for goodwill) is less than its carrying value, we then would proceed with the quantitative impairment test to compare the fair value to the carrying value and record an impairment charge if the carrying value exceeds the fair value.\n\nWe have an agreement with Genmab to develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer, under which we previously exercised a co-development option for tisotumab vedotin. In October 2020, we and Genmab entered into a joint commercialization agreement to govern the global commercialization of tisotumab vedotin, if we are successful in obtaining any regulatory approvals of tisotumab vedotin. Costs associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense.\nThe change in net cash from investing activities from 2020 as compared to 2019 reflected differences between the proceeds received from sale and maturity of our investments and amounts reinvested, and the difference for purchases of property, plant, and equipment.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the remaining potential milestone payments to us under our other ADC license and collaboration agreements could total approximately $1.6 billion if all potential product candidates achieved all of their milestone events. Of this amount, approximately $0.9 billion relates to the achievement of development and regulatory milestones, and approximately $0.7 billion relates to the achievement of commercial milestones. Since we do not control the research, development or commercialization of any of the products that would generate these milestones, we are not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any potential future milestone payments or royalties may be payable by our collaborators. Successfully developing a product candidate, obtaining regulatory approval and ultimately commercializing it is a significantly lengthy and highly uncertain process which entails a significant risk of failure. In addition, business combinations, changes in a collaborator's business strategy and financial difficulties or other factors could result and have resulted in a collaborator abandoning or delaying development of its product candidates. As such, the potential future milestone payments associated with our ADC collaboration agreements involve a substantial degree of risk and may never be received. Accordingly, we do not expect, and investors should not assume, that we will receive all of the potential milestone payments described above, and it is possible that we may never receive any additional significant milestone payments under these agreements.\n\u2022Commercial launch with Astellas, for patients with previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer, following FDA approval in December 2019.\nSee the section Recent accounting pronouncements\u201d in Note 1 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022Received breakthrough therapy designation in first-line advanced urothelial cancer for PADCEV in combination with pembrolizumab.\nBecause of the above and other factors, our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance.\nWe evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions.\nRoyalty revenues\nCost of sales increased in 2020 as compared to 2019, driven by the Astellas gross profit share related to PADCEV net product sales, a payment owed to a third-party technology licensor resulting from the TUKSYA Agreement, amortization expense associated with acquired TUKSYA technology costs, and in-licensing royalties owed on PADCEV and TUKYSA net product sales. The gross profit share with Astellas totaled $104.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We recorded amortization expense of $16.3 million for acquired TUKYSA technology costs during the year ended December 31, 2020, which began following FDA approval of TUKYSA in April 2020.\n\n\nAccrued Liabilities. As part of the process of preparing financial statements, we estimate accrued liabilities. This process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. We record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued liabilities include amounts due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials, amounts due in conjunction with manufacturing our product candidates, third-party royalties that accrue on our sales of our marketed products, and professional service fees, among other items.\nWe anticipate that selling, general and administrative expenses will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 as we continue our commercial activities in support of our products, and invest in infrastructure to support our continued growth in the U.S. and Europe.\nIn-process research and development assets are accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets and maintained on the balance sheet until either the underlying project is completed or the asset becomes impaired. If the project is completed, which generally occurs when FDA approval is obtained, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset beginning in the period in which the project is completed. We periodically evaluate when facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable. If the asset becomes impaired or is abandoned, the carrying value of the related intangible asset is written down to its fair value and an impairment charge is recorded in the period in which the impairment occurs.\nWe anticipate that our total research and development expenses in 2021 will increase compared to 2020 primarily due to higher costs for the continued development of our approved products and product candidates.\n\nThird-party costs for other clinical stage programs were related to multiple earlier-stage development programs and were relatively consistent across 2020 and 2019.\nWe recognized license revenue of $850.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 associated with the LV and Stock Purchase Agreements, and we recognize such cost sharing proportionately with the performance of the underlying activities, while recording Merck's reimbursement of our expenses as a reduction of research and development expenses.\n\nWe expect that amounts received from our collaboration agreements, including royalties, will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows. These revenues and cash flows will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development, clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements, as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements.\n\u2022Royalty revenues - estimating Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS to the extent actual information is not available\nWe generally invoice our collaborators and licensees on a monthly or quarterly basis, or upon the completion of the effort or achievement of a milestone, based on the terms of each agreement. Deferred revenue arises from amounts received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods as performance obligations are satisfied. Deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability.\nSelling, general and administrative\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks: We have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, or MDRA, with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This agreement provides for a rebate based on covered purchases of our products. Medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state Medicaid programs. We estimate Medicaid rebates using the expected value approach, based on a variety of factors, including payor mix and our experience to-date.\n\nFor 2020, our total revenues increased to $2.2 billion, compared to $916.7 million in 2019. This growth was driven by $975.2 million collaboration and license agreement revenues recognized related to the agreements we entered into with Merck during 2020, the U.S. launches of PADCEV beginning in December 2019 and TUKYSA in April 2020, respectively, as well as higher ADCETRIS net product sales.\nAlso refer to Part I Item 1 Business\u201d for more information about our products, pipeline, technologies, research programs, and future plans for our clinical programs, including recent key business achievements.\nadditional indications in the U.S., including in the frontline metastatic urothelial cancer setting, and in territories outside the U.S., our ability and Astellas' ability to successfully comply with rigorous post-marketing requirements, including obtaining the FDA's agreement as to the confirmation of clinical benefit of PADCEV based on the results of the EV-301 clinical trial, the acceptance of PADCEV by the medical community and patients, the extent to which physicians make prescribing decisions with respect to PADCEV, the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment in PADCEV's approved indication, the duration of therapy for patients receiving PADCEV, the extent to which coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for PADCEV are available from governments and other third-party payors, the impact of any healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, including measures that could potentially result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for PADCEV, potential competition from competing therapies, the impact of conducting launch activities virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including potential negative impacts of reduced cancer diagnosis rates. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, including the lack of significant historical sales data, PADCEV sales are currently difficult to predict from period to period.\nWe utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple research and development projects. We track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning. We do not account for actual costs on a project basis as it relates to our infrastructure, facility, employee and other indirect costs; however, we do separately track significant third-party costs including clinical trial costs, manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project basis. To that end, the following table shows third-party costs incurred for research, contract manufacturing of our product candidates and clinical and regulatory services, as well as development milestone payments for in-licensed technology for our products\nADCETRIS\nWe sell ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA through a limited number of specialty distributors and specialty pharmacies. We and our collaboration partner Astellas jointly promote PADCEV in the U.S. Under the joint promotion in the U.S., we record net sales of PADCEV and are responsible for all distribution through a limited number of specialty distributors. The delivery of our products represents a single performance obligation for these transactions and we record net product sales at the point in time when title and risk of loss pass. The transaction price for net product sales represents the amount we expect to receive, which is net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, estimated product returns, and other deductions. Accruals are established for these deductions, and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals. We reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor or as an accrued liability, depending on the nature of the sales deduction. Sales deductions are based on management's estimates that consider payor mix in target markets and experience to-date. These estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment. We have applied a portfolio approach as a practical expedient for estimating net product sales.\n\u2022Reported net product sales of $1 billion for full year 2020.\nWe have other collaboration and license agreements for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We typically receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. These amounts are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation period if the license is determined not to be distinct from other goods and services provided, or, if there is no performance obligation, upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer.\nWe have entered into leases for our office and laboratory facilities expiring in 2021 through 2029 that contain rate escalations and options for us to extend the leases. Operating lease obligations in the table above do not assume the exercise by us of any extension options.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nBusiness combinations, including acquired in-process research and development and goodwill. We account for business combinations using the acquisition method, recording the acquisition-date fair value of total consideration over the acquisition-date fair value of net assets acquired as goodwill.\nInvestment and other income, net includes other non-operating income and loss, such as unrealized holding gains and losses on equity securities (which primarily include common stock holdings in Immunomedics prior to the sale of these securities in April 2020), realized gains and losses on equity and debt securities, and amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe expect growth in net product sales in 2021 from 2020 to be primarily driven by sales growth of TUKYSA and PADCEV, and to a lesser extent, ADCETRIS.\nResearch and development\nThird-party costs for ladiratuzumab vedotin decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower research and clinical development expenses as well as cost-sharing reimbursements received from Merck in 2020 related to the LV Agreement.\nMerck LV collaboration\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues by collaborator were as follows:\nWe primarily have financed our operations through the issuance of our common stock, collections from commercial sales of our products, amounts received pursuant to license and collaboration agreements, and royalty revenues. To a lesser degree, we also have financed our operations through investment income. These financing and revenue sources have allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments.\nRoyalty revenues primarily reflect royalties earned under the ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda. These royalties include commercial sales-based milestones and sales royalties. Sales royalties are based on a percentage of Takeda's net sales of ADCETRIS, with rates that range from the mid-teens to the mid-twenties based on annual net sales tiers. Takeda bears third-party royalty costs owed on its sales of ADCETRIS. This amount is included in royalty revenues. Royalty revenues also reflect, to a lesser extent, amounts from Genentech earned on net sales of Polivy beginning in 2019, and amounts from GlaxoSmithKline earned on net sales of Blenrep beginning in August 2020, both of which utilizes technology that we have licensed to them.\nOur ongoing research, development, manufacturing and commercial activities will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful. We expect that we will incur substantial expenses, and we will require significant financial resources and additional personnel in order to advance the development of, to pursue, obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, and to commercialize our products and product candidates, and expand our pipeline. In addition, we may pursue new operations or continue the expansion of our existing operations, including with respect to our plans to build a commercial infrastructure in Europe and to otherwise continue to expand our operations internationally. As a result, we may need to raise additional capital, and our operating expenses may fluctuate as a result of such activities. We may also incur milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization.\n2020 highlights and recent developments\n\u2022Entered into a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Merck for our drug candidate ladiratuzumab vedotin.\nThe gain on equity securities in the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by a realized gain in April 2020 from the sale of our equity securities, offset in part by an unrealized loss on equity securities during the first quarter of 2020.\nFair value is typically estimated using an income approach based on the present value of future discounted cash flows. The significant estimates in the discounted cash flow model primarily include the discount rate, rates of future revenue growth and/or profitability of the acquired business. The discount rate considers the relevant risk associated with business-specific characteristics and the uncertainty related to the ability to achieve the projected cash flows. We may record adjustments to the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed within the measurement period (up to one year from the acquisition date).\nOverview\nWe discuss the below arrangements in greater detail under the heading Corporate Collaborations\u201d in Part I Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022Collaboration and license agreement revenues - assessing the probability of future reversal of variable consideration and evaluating whether contractual obligations represent distinct performance obligations\nWe expect to make additional capital outlays and to increase operating expenditures over the next several years as we hire additional employees, and support our development, commercialization, invest in our facilities, and expand globally, which may require us to raise additional capital. Further, we actively evaluate various strategic transactions on an ongoing basis, including licensing or otherwise acquiring complementary products, technologies or businesses, and we may require significant additional capital in order to complete or otherwise provide funding for such transactions. We may seek additional capital through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations, licensing arrangements, and public or private debt or equity financings. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, our business and operations may be adversely affected.\nPipeline\nRoyalty revenues decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to Takeda's achievement of a $40.0 million sales-based milestone during 2019, offset in part by 2020 growth in Takeda net sales of ADCETRIS in its territories, as well as higher Roche net sales of Polivy.\nMerck TUKYSA collaboration\n\u2022Announced positive results from tisotumab vedotin pivotal trial in patients with previously treated recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer. Data used to support approval application submitted in the U.S. in February 2021.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nThe biopharmaceutical industry and the markets in which we operate are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors are working to develop or have commercialized products similar to those we market or are developing. Drug prices are under significant scrutiny and we expect drug pricing and other health care costs to continue to be subject to intense political and societal pressures on a global basis. For example, in July 2020, then-President Trump announced four Executive Orders related to reducing prescription drug prices and we expect that drug pricing will continue to be subject to close scrutiny by federal, state and foreign governments. In addition to pricing actions and other measures being taken worldwide designed to reduce healthcare costs and limit the overall level of government expenditures, our sales and operations could also be affected by other risks of doing business internationally.\nThe following table reflects our future minimum contractual commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nThird-party costs for TUKYSA decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily due to lower clinical supply expenses. Following the approval of TUKYSA in April 2020, we began capitalizing inventory costs manufactured for commercial sale.\n\u2022Continued to make strategic investments in our pipeline, commercial launches, infrastructure, and headcount to support our future growth.\nOther costs and overhead include third-party costs of our preclinical programs and costs associated with personnel and facilities. These costs increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due primarily to due to the addition of new preclinical programs and higher employee-related expenses from headcount growth.\nThird-party costs for PADCEV decreased slightly in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the timing of our ongoing clinical trials.\nIn 2018, we acquired Cascadian for $10.00 per share in cash, or approximately $614.1 million. Cascadian was included in our results of operations as of the acquisition date. Accordingly, the results discussed below were impacted by the timing of this acquisition. For additional information, refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nComparability\n\nWe expect that royalty revenues will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher royalties from anticipated growth in ADCETRIS sales volume by Takeda, as well as anticipated sales growth of our other licensees.\n\u2022Entered into exclusive license and co-development agreement with Merck to commercialize TUKYSA in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe.\nLiquidity and capital resources\n\nRecent accounting pronouncements\ncountry-specific clinical trials necessary to support anticipated regulatory applications in its territories. We received an upfront cash payment from Merck of $125.0 million and also received $85.0 million in prepaid research and development funding to be applied to Merck's global development cost sharing obligations. We are eligible to receive progress-dependent milestone payments of up to $65.0 million, and are entitled to receive tiered royalties on sales of TUKYSA by Merck that begin in the low twenty percent range and escalate based sales volume by Merck in its territory. We owe Array a portion of any non-royalty payments received from sublicensing TUKSYA rights, as well as a low double-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by us, and will owe a single-digit royalty based on net sales of TUKYSA by Merck in its territories.\n\n\u2022Received marketing authorization in the European Union in February 2021.\nOur net product sales grew 59% during 2020 as compared to 2019, primarily driven by recent product launches of PADCEV and TUKYSA. We began commercializing PADCEV and TUKYSA following FDA approvals in December 2019 and April 2020, respectively. ADCETRIS net product sales increased in 2020 from 2019 due to higher sales volumes and the effect of price increases during the current year period.\nRevenue Recognition. Our revenues are comprised of ADCETRIS, PADCEV and TUKYSA net product sales, amounts earned under our collaboration and licensing agreements, and royalties. Revenue recognition occurs when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The period between when we transfer control of promised goods or services and when we receive payment is expected to be one year or less, and that expectation is consistent with our historical experience. As such, we do not adjust our revenues for the effects of a significant financing component.\nResults of Operations - Years Ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018\nCollaboration revenues from Takeda fluctuate based on changes in the recognized portion of reimbursement funding under the ADCETRIS collaboration, which are impacted by the activities each party is performing under the collaboration agreement at a given time. For example, when Takeda's level of spending on clinical collaboration activities increases above our own, our earned portion of reimbursement funding generally decreases. Additionally, we receive reimbursement for the cost of drug product supplied to Takeda for its use, the timing of which fluctuates based on Takeda's product supply needs. Collaboration revenues from Takeda can also fluctuate based on the achievement of milestones by Takeda. Collaboration revenues from Takeda in 2020 decreased compared to 2019, primarily as a result of two regulatory milestones achieved in 2019 totaling $37.5 million, which were related to approvals of ADCETRIS in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma, and the completion of the Takeda performance period in November 2019.\n\u2022Expanded clinical program including initiation of phase 3 trial in relapsed and refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and expanded a trial in frontline Hodgkin lymphoma to evaluate stage I and II patients.\nand certain of our clinical-stage product candidates. The table also presents other costs and overhead consisting of third-party costs for our preclinical stage programs, as well as personnel, facilities, manufacturing, and other indirect costs not directly charged to development programs.\n\n\u2022Announced positive topline results from EV-301 phase 3 trial showing that PADCEV significantly improved overall survival in previously treated metastatic urothelial cancer patients. Data to support global marketing applications.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and investments and $3.5 billion in total stockholders' equity.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our investment in TUKYSA is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our and Merck's ability to successfully launch, market and commercialize TUKYSA in our respective territories in its approved indication, the extent to which we and Merck are able to obtain regulatory and other required governmental and pricing and reimbursement approvals of TUKYSA in additional territories, the extent to which we and Merck are able to obtain regulatory approvals of TUKYSA in additional indications, including earlier lines of breast cancer and other HER2-positive cancers, the acceptance of TUKYSA by the medical community and patients, competition from other therapies, our and Merck's ability to accurately predict and supply product demand, the extent to which coverage and reimbursement will be available from governments and other third-party payors, our capacity to effectively commercialize a product outside of the U.S., the impact of conducting launch activities virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic and other impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including potential negative impacts of reduced cancer diagnosis rates. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, including the lack of significant historical sales data, TUKYSA sales are currently difficult to predict from period to period.\nThird-party costs for ADCETRIS increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily due to increased activities associated with our ongoing ADCETRIS clinical trials. The cost of drug product supplied to Takeda is charged to research and development expense. We are reimbursed for the drug product, which is included in collaboration and license agreement revenues.\nOur cash, cash equivalents, and investments are held in a variety of non-interest bearing bank accounts and interest-bearing instruments subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in U.S. government and agency securities, corporate securities, taxable municipal bonds, commercial paper and money market accounts. Our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash to fund our anticipated working capital needs. However, if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term, or investments do not pay at maturity, we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities, which may result in a loss. As of December 31, 2020, we had $2.7 billion held in cash, cash equivalents, and investments.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d As a result of these risks and uncertainties, we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects, anticipated completion dates, or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of our products in any additional approved indications or of any of our product candidates.\nCollaboration and license agreements are initially evaluated as to whether the intellectual property licenses granted by us represent distinct performance obligations. If they are determined to be distinct, the value of the intellectual property licenses would be recognized up-front while the research and development service fees would be recognized as the performance obligations are satisfied. Variable consideration is assessed at each reporting period as to whether it is not subject to future reversal of cumulative revenue and, therefore, should be included in the transaction price. Assessing the recognition of variable consideration requires significant judgment. If a contract includes a fixed or minimum amount of research and development support, this also would be included in the transaction price. Changes to collaboration and license agreements, such as the extensions of the research term or increasing the number of targets or technology covered under an existing agreement, are assessed for whether they represent a modification or should be accounted for as a new contract.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2020 and 2019 as compared to prior years primarily due to increased field sales personnel and external spend to support our recently commercialized products, and higher infrastructure costs to support our continued growth in the U.S. and Europe.\nWhen no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized upon transfer of control of the goods or services to the customer. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue in the period the related sale occurred.\nSome of our manufacturing, license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods, profit share payments, and/or payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones. Some of our licensing agreements obligate us to pay royalties based on net sales of products utilizing licensed technology. Such royalties and profit share payments are dependent on future product sales and are not provided for in the table above as they are dependent on events that have not yet occurred. Future milestone payments for research and pre-clinical stage development programs have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred, which consisted of up to approximately $2.1 billion in total potential future milestone payments to third parties under our collaboration and license agreements with these parties. These milestone payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, clinical, regulatory and/or commercial milestones. These contingent payments have not been included in the above table as the event triggering such payment or obligation has not yet occurred.\n\nIncome taxes\nIn order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization, the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety, toxicology and efficacy studies. We then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete. The length of time varies substantially based upon the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of a product candidate. We will also need to conduct additional clinical trials in order to expand labeled indications of use for our commercial products. The outcome of our clinical trials is uncertain. The cost of clinical trials may vary significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the number of patients enrolled, patient site costs, quantity and source of drug supply required, safety and efficacy of the product candidate, and extent of regulatory efforts, among others.\nWe are closely evaluating the impacts of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our ability and the ability of our collaborators to effectively market, sell and distribute our products and to develop our products and product candidates. While our field-based personnel are engaging in limited in-person interactions, they are primarily using electronic communication, such as emails, phone calls and video conferences. Many healthcare professionals that we normally call on are working a greater proportion of their working schedule from home and are facing additional demands on their time during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We are experiencing increased competition for virtual appointments with healthcare professionals and a significant reduction in the number of interactions our sales personnel are having with physicians. We expect the different quality of electronic interactions as compared with in-person interactions, as well as the reduced quantity of interactions during the COVID-19 pandemic, to reduce the effectiveness of our sales personnel, as well as those of our collaborators, which could negatively affect our product sales and those of our collaborators, as well as physician awareness of our products. With respect to PADCEV and TUKYSA specifically, we have not launched a product using primarily virtual communication channels in the past and cannot predict the effects that this approach will ultimately have on demand for PADCEV or TUKYSA. However, we believe that the need to conduct these activities virtually is negatively impacting our ability to connect with key customers, including those familiar with competitive products, and our ability to conduct payor engagements. We face a number of challenges that will limit our ability to fully resume in-person interactions for the foreseeable future, including increasing COVID-19 infection rates in many states, the potential for more severe outbreaks, the need to navigate varying restrictions for entering healthcare facilities and employee childcare obligations during virtual school sessions. In addition, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to evolve rapidly, and we may subsequently be forced to, or subsequently determine that we should, resume a more restrictive remote work model, whether as a result of further spikes or surges in COVID-19 infection or hospitalization rates or otherwise. Moreover, the long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are also unknown and it is possible that following the pandemic, healthcare institutions could alter their policies with respect to in person visits by pharmaceutical company representatives. COVID-19 related restrictions could also present product distribution challenges as we utilize recently initiated distribution channels for TUKYSA. We also expect that the conversion of medical conferences to a virtual format may reduce our ability to effectively disseminate scientific information about our products, which may result in decreased physician awareness of our products, their approved indications and their efficacy and safety. The evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may also negatively affect our product sales due to challenges in patient access to healthcare settings, significant increases in unemployment and the resulting loss of individual health insurance coverage, and inability to access government healthcare programs due to backlogs, some or all of which appear to be affecting diagnosis rates and may affect side effect management, course of treatment and increase enrollment in our patient support programs. With respect to ADCETRIS specifically, impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic appear to be reducing the rate of Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses. In addition, we have experienced lower than expected levels of our research and development spending, in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. This includes some delays in clinical trial enrollment as well as reduced travel due to the conversion of medical and scientific meetings to virtual format. While we do not at this time anticipate the need to revise our publicly reported projected clinical milestone dates as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be some impacts to our clinical study timelines, which, depending upon the duration and severity of the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, could ultimately delay data availability. In addition, many of our non-essential on-site research activities are currently significantly reduced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may negatively impact the number of investigational new drug application, or IND, candidates entering our clinical pipeline in future years. The extent to which the risks and evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic impact our business, our ability to generate sales of and revenues from our approved products, and our clinical development and regulatory efforts will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the ultimate duration and severity of the pandemic, government actions, such as travel restrictions, quarantines and social distancing requirements in the U.S. and in other countries, business closures or business disruptions and the effectiveness of actions taken in the U.S. and in other countries to contain and treat the disease, including the effectiveness and timing of vaccine programs in the U.S. and worldwide.\nInvestment income reflects amounts earned on our investments in U.S. Treasury securities. Investment income decreased in 2020 compared to 2019 due to due to lower average yields on our investment portfolio during 2020.\nCommitments\nFinancial summary\nWe have a collaboration agreement with Agensys, Inc., which subsequently became an affiliate of Astellas, to jointly research, develop and commercialize ADCs for the treatment of several types of cancer. Under this collaboration, we and Astellas are co-funding all development costs for PADCEV. Cost associated with co-development activities are included in research and development expense. Gross profit share payments owed to Astellas in the U.S. under the joint commercialization agreement are recorded in cost of sales.\nCost of sales\nCollaboration agreements\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits from our investment in PADCEV is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including our and Astellas' ability to successfully jointly market and commercialize PADCEV in the U.S. in its approved indication, the extent to which we and Astellas are able to obtain regulatory approvals of PADCEV in\nIn addition, the section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 6, 2020.\n\u2022Commercial launch following FDA approval for patients with previously treated metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer, including patients with brain metastases in April 2020.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues from Merck included license revenues of $725.0 million related to the collaboration agreements for LV and TUKYSA that were entered into in 2020, as well as a stock purchase premium paid by Merck of $250.1 million. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 for additional information.\nProcess sciences and manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses, manufacturing costs for the scale-up and pre-approval manufacturing of drug product used in research and our clinical trials, and costs for drug product supplied to our collaborators. Process sciences and manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities, and storage and shipment of our product candidates. The increase in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily reflected higher employee-related costs and external development costs primarily to support our early- and late-stage pipeline of product candidates, as well as higher costs for drug product supplied to Takeda.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues reflect amounts earned under certain of our license and collaboration agreements. These revenues reflect the earned portion of license fees, payments received by us for technology access and maintenance fees, milestone payments and reimbursement payments for research and development support that we provide to our collaborators.\nIncome Taxes. We have net deferred tax assets which are offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We believe that a valuation allowance is appropriate as we have a history of net operating losses. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made, a portion of which would increase income (or decrease losses) in the period in which such a determination was made. We follow the guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, which requires the recognition of an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not to be sustainable upon audit by the applicable taxing authority.\n\n\u2022Reported the five-year update of the phase 3 ECHELON-1 clinical trial which showed treatment with ADCETRIS in combination with AVD resulted in superior long-term outcomes when compared to ABVD, which includes bleomycin, in frontline advanced Hodgkin lymphoma.\nSeagen is a biotechnology company that develops and commercializes targeted therapies to treat cancer. We are commercializing ADCETRIS for the treatment of certain CD30-expressing lymphomas, PADCEV for the treatment of certain metastatic urothelial cancers, and TUKYSA for treatment of certain metastatic HER2-positive breast cancers. We are also advancing a pipeline of novel therapies for solid tumors and blood-related cancers designed to address unmet medical needs and improve treatment outcomes for patients. Many of our programs, including ADCETRIS and PADCEV, are based on our antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, technology that utilizes the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. In October 2020, we changed our corporate name from Seattle Genetics, Inc. to Seagen Inc., reflecting the global expansion of our operations.\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements\u201d for purposes of these provisions, including those relating to future events or our future financial performance and financial guidance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as may,\u201d might,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d plan,\u201d anticipate,\u201d project,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential,\u201d intend\u201d or continue,\u201d the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology, and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These statements are only predictions. All forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong. Actual events or results may differ materially. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in greater detail in Part I Item 1A - Risk Factors.\u201d We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.\nWe have collaboration and license agreements for our technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Under these agreements, we typically receive or are entitled to receive upfront cash payments and progress- and sales-dependent milestones for the achievement by our licensees of certain events, and annual maintenance fees and support fees for research and development services and materials provided under the agreements. We also are entitled to receive royalties on net sales of any resulting products incorporating our technology. Our licensees are solely responsible for research, product development, manufacturing and commercialization of any product candidates under these collaborations, which includes the achievement of the potential milestones. Since we may not take a substantive role or control the research, development or commercialization of any products generated by some of our licensees, we may not able to reasonably estimate when, if at all, any potential future milestone payments or royalties may be payable to us by our licensees. As such, the potential future milestone payments associated with certain of our collaboration and license agreements involve a substantial degree of uncertainty and risk that they may never be received.\nInvestment and other income, net\nIn September 2020, we entered into the LV Agreement with a subsidiary of Merck. We are pursuing a broad joint development program evaluating LV as monotherapy and in combination settings, including with Merck's anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA\u00ae (pembrolizumab) in triple-negative breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and other LIV-1-expressing solid tumors. Under the terms of the LV Agreement, we granted Merck a co-exclusive worldwide development and commercialization license for LV, and agreed to jointly develop and commercialize LV on a worldwide basis. We received an upfront cash payment of $600.0 million, and we are eligible to receive up to $850.0 million in milestone payments upon the initiation of certain clinical trials and regulatory approval in certain major markets, and up to an additional $1.8 billion in milestone payments upon the achievement of specified annual global net sales thresholds of LV. Each company is responsible for 50% of global costs to develop and commercialize LV and will receive 50% of potential future profits. In connection with the LV Agreement, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Merck in September 2020, pursuant to which we agreed to issue and sell, and Merck agreed to purchase 5,000,000 newly-issued shares of our common stock, at a purchase price of $200 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $1.0 billion, referred to as the Purchase Agreement. We closed the Purchase Agreement on October 27, 2020 following the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976.\nWe expect our collaboration and license agreement revenues in 2021 to significantly decrease compared to 2020, driven by the amounts recognized related to the Merck Agreements in 2020. Our collaboration and license agreement revenues are impacted by the term and duration of those agreements and by progress-dependent milestones, annual maintenance fees, and reimbursement of materials and support services. Collaboration and license agreement revenues may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates, the level of support we provide to our collaborators, specifically to Takeda under our ADCETRIS collaboration, the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into potential additional collaboration and license agreements.\nGovernment-mandated rebates and chargebacks are the most significant component of our total gross-to-net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing. These discount percentages increased during 2020 and 2019 as a result of price increases for ADCETRIS that we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation. The most significant portion of our gross-to-net accrual balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was for ADCETRIS Medicaid rebates. We expect future gross-to-net deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases, the rate of inflation, and other factors. We expect gross-to-net deductions to increase in 2021 as compared to 2020, driven by anticipated growth in our gross product sales.\nCorporate\nThird-party costs for tisotumab vedotin decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019, due to the timing of our and Genmab's ongoing clinical trials.\nAstellas PADCEV collaboration\n\nWe have concluded that the license of intellectual property in certain collaboration and license agreements is not distinct from the perspective of our customers at the time of initial transfer, since we often do not license intellectual property without related technology transfer and research and development support services. Such evaluation requires significant judgment since it is made from the customer's perspective. Our performance obligations under our collaborations may include such things as providing intellectual property licenses, performing technology transfer, performing research and development consulting services, providing reagents, ADCs, and other materials, and notifying the customer of any enhancements to licensed technology or new technology that we discover, among others. We determined our performance obligations under certain collaboration and license agreements as evaluated at contract inception were not distinct and represented a single performance obligation. For those agreements, revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model, representing the transfer of goods or services as activities are performed over the term of the agreement. Upfront payments are also amortized to revenue over the performance period. Upfront payment contract liabilities resulting from our collaborations do not represent a financing component as the payment is not financing the transfer of goods or services, and the technology underlying the licenses granted reflects research and development expenses already incurred by us. For agreements beyond the initial performance period, we have no remaining performance obligations. We may receive license maintenance fees and potential milestones and royalties based on collaborator development and regulatory progress, which are recorded in the period achieved in the case of milestones, and during the period of the related sales for royalties.\nFor 2020, total costs and expenses increased to $1.6 billion, compared to $1.1 billion in 2019. This primarily reflected higher cost of sales, higher selling, general and administrative expenses, and higher research and development expenses.\nLong-term Incentive Plans. We have long term incentive plans which provide eligible employees with the opportunity to receive performance-based incentive compensation, which may be comprised of cash, stock options, and/or restricted stock units. The payment of cash and the grant or vesting of equity awards are contingent upon the achievement of pre-determined regulatory milestones. We record compensation expense over the estimated service period for each milestone when we believe the milestone is considered probable, which we assess at each reporting date. Once a milestone is considered probable, we record compensation expense based on the portion of the service period elapsed to date with respect to that milestone, with a cumulative catch-up, net of estimated forfeitures, and recognize any remaining compensation expense, if any, over the remaining estimated service period.\nThe change in net cash from operating activities from 2020 as compared to 2019 primarily was related to the change in our net income (loss), working capital fluctuations and changes in our non-cash expenses, all of which are highly variable. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by $975.2 million in collaboration and license agreement revenues recognized related to the agreements we entered into with Merck during 2020.\nCollaboration and license agreement revenues\nWe adopted ASC Topic 842-Leases on January 1, 2019, resulting in a change to our accounting policy for leases. We recorded a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing our right to use the underlying assets for the applicable lease terms in our consolidated balance sheet at January 1, 2019. We used the modified retrospective method transition option. Accordingly, 2018 comparative information has not been adjusted and continues to be reported under previous accounting standards. For additional information, refer to Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGross-to-net deductions, net of related payments and credits, were as follows:\n\u2022Net product sales - sales deductions related to government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, such as for the Medicaid and 340B programs\nWe apply significant judgment to our estimates in the following revenue recognition areas, each as discussed in more detail in the corresponding sections after this list:\nIn September 2020, we entered into the TUKYSA Agreement with a subsidiary of Merck. We granted exclusive rights to commercialize TUKYSA in Asia, the Middle East and Latin America and other regions outside of the U.S., Canada and Europe. Under the terms of the TUKYSA Agreement, Merck is responsible for marketing applications for approval in its territory, supported by the positive results from the HER2CLIMB clinical trial. We retained commercial rights in, and will record sales in, the U.S., Canada and Europe. Merck is also co-funding a portion of the TUKYSA global development plan, which encompasses several ongoing and planned trials across HER2-positive cancers. We will continue to lead ongoing TUKYSA global development operational execution. Merck will solely fund and conduct\nTakeda ADCETRIS collaboration\nWe did not generate pre-tax income during 2019 or 2018. In 2018, we recognized a deferred tax liability of $23.7 million on acquired intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of Cascadian. As a result, we recorded an income tax benefit of $23.7 million for the release of valuation allowance on our existing U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the offset of deferred tax liabilities established for intangible assets from the acquisition.\n\u2022Expanded indication approved in the European Union and first approval in China for our partner Takeda.\nNet product sales\nWe have a Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement under which certain U.S. government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of our products. In addition, we have entered into a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS, to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of our products. Under these agreements, distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price. We estimate expected chargebacks for FSS and PHS purchases based on the expected value of each entity's eligibility for the FSS and PHS programs. We also review historical rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates.\nCost of sales includes manufacturing and distribution costs of product sold, gross profit share with Astellas pursuant to our PADCEV collaboration, amortization of acquired technology license costs, royalties owed on our PADCEV net product sales and global ADCETRIS and TUKSYA net product sales.\n\u2022Received ex-U.S. regulatory approvals in Australia, Canada, Singapore and Switzerland under the Project Orbis initiative of the FDA Oncology Center of Excellence.\nThe change in net cash from financing activities included proceeds from issuances of common stock, the exercise of options to purchase shares of our common stock, and common stock sales under our employee stock purchase plan for all years presented.\n\u2022Initiated phase 1 trials of two novel drug candidates, SGN-B6A and SEA-TGT.\nOther collaboration and license agreements\nWe recognize revenue from ADCETRIS product sales in the U.S. and Canada, and PADCEV and TUKYSA products sales in the U.S. While we anticipate that sales of ADCETRIS will increase in 2021 as compared to 2020, we have experienced and expect continued impacts associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which appear to be reducing the rate of Hodgkin lymphoma diagnoses, and an increase in gross-to-net deductions that we believe is due to a shift in the locations where ADCETRIS is administered, which has increased the proportion of ADCETRIS sales through the federal 340B drug discount program. We expect that, going forward, our ability to maintain or continue to grow our ADCETRIS sales, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to establish or demonstrate to the medical community the value of ADCETRIS and its potential advantages compared to existing and future therapeutics in its approved indications, including in the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma indication, and the extent to which physicians make prescribing decisions with respect to ADCETRIS. Other important factors affecting our ADCETRIS sales include the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment in ADCETRIS' approved indications, the extent to which coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement for ADCETRIS are available from governments and other third-party payors, the impact of any healthcare reform measures that may be upheld, or adopted in the future, including measures that could result in more rigorous coverage criteria or reduce the price that we receive for ADCETRIS, increasing competition from competing therapies including pembrolizumab in multiple indications, including in the relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma indication, impacts resulting from the evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic including lower diagnosis rates, and the potential future approval of ADCETRIS in any additional indications. For these reasons, we cannot assure you that ADCETRIS sales will continue to grow or that we can maintain sales of ADCETRIS at or near current levels. In addition, as a result of these and other factors, our future ADCETRIS product sales can be difficult to accurately predict from period to period.\nGenmab tisotumab vedotin collaboration\n\u2022Entered into oncology collaborations with Merck under which we received $725 million in upfront payments and $1 billion through an equity investment by Merck.\nIn accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period. If the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate, we will adjust the accrual accordingly. In the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services, our actual liabilities would differ from such estimates. The date on which some services commence, the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations. We make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time.\nTUKYSA\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOutlook\nAt our currently planned spending rates, we believe that our existing financial resources, together with product and royalty revenues, and the fees, milestone payments and reimbursements we expect to receive under our existing collaboration and license agreements, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months.\n\u2022Announced positive topline results from second cohort of EV-201 pivotal trial.
