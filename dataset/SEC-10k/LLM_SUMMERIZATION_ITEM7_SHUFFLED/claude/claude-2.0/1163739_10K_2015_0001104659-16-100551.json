MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included under Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Part 1A.-Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nManagement Overview\nWe own and operate the world's largest land-based drilling rig fleet and are a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. Our Drilling & Rig Services business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig services, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation, optimization software and directional drilling services. Our Drilling & Rig Services business consist of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services.\nOn March 24, 2015, we completed the Merger of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J Energy. In the Merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion & Production Service business was exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, CJES, and is now accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate as of the acquisition date. See further discussion in Note 9-Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Prior to the Merger, our Completion & Production Services business conducted our operations involved in the completion, life-of-well maintenance and plugging and abandonment of a well in the United States and Canada. These services include stimulation, coiled-tubing, cementing, wireline, workover, well-servicing and fluids management. As a result of the Merger, we report our share of the earnings (losses) of CJES through earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of income (loss). CJES provides well construction, well completions, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America. As we no longer consolidate the results of operations from our historical Completion & Production Services business, our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are not directly comparable to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nOutlook\nThe demand for our services is a function of the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The primary driver of customer spending is their cash flow and earnings which are largely driven by oil and natural gas prices. The oil and natural gas markets have traditionally been volatile and tend to be highly sensitive to supply and demand cycles. During the second half of 2014, the markets experienced a dramatic decline in oil prices which remained depressed throughout 2015 and into 2016 due, at least in part, to an increase in global crude supply coupled with stagnant demand. Oil prices have declined by more than 60% from the peak oil prices of 2014, falling to approximately $35 per barrel in late 2015. Subsequent to year end, oil prices have continued to decline reaching a low of $26.21 per barrel on February 11, 2016.\nAs a result of the sustained reduction in the price of oil, we have experienced a decline in the demand, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in the international market, for drilling services as customers have reduced or curtailed their capital spending and drilling activities. The reduction in demand for drilling services, coupled with the increased supply of newly built high-specification rigs in the drilling market, among other factors, has led to a highly competitive market for all rigs. Accordingly, we have also experienced downward pricing pressure for our services.\nDue to the decline in oil prices and customers' reduced drilling activity, we have experienced a decline in our dayrates as well as the average number of rigs operating, most notably in the lower 48 states. In our U.S. Drilling operating segment, our rig years (a measure of activity and utilization) have decreased from 212.5 years during fiscal year 2014 to 120.0 years during fiscal year 2015. In our Canada Drilling operating segment, our rig years have declined by roughly 51% from 2014. Our International operating segment has not been immune from the impact of lower oil prices. Although international drilling markets tend to react slower than the North American markets, we began to experience downward pressure on dayrates in the International segment beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Our International rig years declined in the latter half of 2015, primarily due to the conclusion of several drilling projects as well as reduced activity resulting from lower commodity prices. Given the commodity price environment entering 2016, we expect continued erosion at least through the first half of the year in industry rig counts, both domestic and international, as well as continued downward pressure on the utilization and pricing of\nour rig fleets.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $2.24 billion availability remaining under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, which expires July 2020. Availability under the revolving credit facility is subject to a covenant not to exceed a net debt to capital ratio of 0.60:1. As of December 31, 2015, our net debt to capital ratio was 0.44:1. See Item 6. \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d.\nFinancial Results\nDuring 2015, our income (loss) from continuing operations was adversely affected by approximately $369.0 million in impairments and other charges. Net loss from continuing operations totaled $329.5 million for 2015 ($1.14 per diluted share) compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $669.3 million ($2.28 per diluted share) in 2014. The impairment charges stemmed from the impact of the industry downturn on our business activity and future outlook as the continuation of depressed oil prices led to considerable reductions in capital spending by some of our customers and diminished demand for our drilling services. The impairments and retirement provisions were primarily comprised of $140.1 million related to tangible assets and equipment and $180.6 million related to an other-than-temporary impairment on our equity method investment in CJES.\nOperating revenues in 2015 totaled $3.9 billion, representing a decrease of $2.9 billion, or 43%, over 2014. The decrease in revenues was due in part to ceasing to consolidate the revenues associated with our Completion & Production Services business. Further exacerbating the decline in revenues was the decrease in activity and reduced dayrates within our U.S. and Canada Drilling operating segments resulting from the overall decline in oil prices throughout 2015 as mentioned above. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue in our International Drilling operating segment.\nDuring 2014, our income (loss) from continuing operations was adversely affected by approximately $1.03 billion in impairments and other charges. Net loss from continuing operations totaled $669.3 million for 2014 ($2.28 per diluted share) compared to net income from continuing operations of $158.3 million ($0.51 per diluted share) in 2013.\nThe impairments and retirement provisions stemmed from the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the resulting impact on our customers' spending programs and demand for our services. The impairments and retirement provisions were comprised of approximately $611.6 million in charges related to drilling rigs and rig equipment and $386.5 million in impairments to our goodwill and intangible assets. The goodwill and intangible assets were primarily attributable to our Completion Services operating segment from the acquisition of Superior Well Services, Inc. (\u201cSuperior\u201d) in 2010. Of the $611.6 million in charges related to our drilling rigs and rig equipment, the majority is attributable to retirements and impairments to our lower 48 legacy rig fleet (non AC rigs), including the functional retirement of 25 mechanical rigs, an impairment to the SCR fleet and the resultant reduction in yard assets and spare rig components due to reduced operating fleet size. The balance is attributable to charges for the impairment or retirement of our jackup rig fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, our coil tubing drilling rigs in Canada and various other under-utilized rigs and related equipment in Canada and our international markets.\nExcluding these items, our operating results increased in 2014 over 2013. Operating revenues in 2014 totaled $6.8 billion, representing an increase of $652.2 million, or 11%, over 2013. The increase in revenues was driven by increases from virtually all of our operating segments with the exception of Canada Drilling. Adjusted operating income for 2014 totaled $604.3 million, representing an increase of $46.1 million, or 8%, over 2013. This increase was driven primarily by our U.S. and International Drilling and Rig Services operating segments, which more than offset declines in our Completion and Production Services and Canada Drilling operating segments.\nThe following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity:\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year

</tr>\n</table>\nU.S.\nOur U.S. Drilling operating segment includes land drilling activities in the lower 48 states, Alaska and offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a decline in drilling activity in the lower 48 states, reflected by a 44% reduction in rig years during 2015 compared to the prior period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower oil prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and diminished demand as customers released rigs and delayed drilling projects in response to the significant drop in oil prices. The decline in revenue in the lower 48 states was partially offset by a decrease in operating and general and administrative costs for this segment due to cost reduction efforts.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an increase in drilling activity and dayrates in the lower 48 states. We deployed approximately 16 new PACE\u00ae-X rigs into service in 2014, bringing our total operating fleet of PACE\u00ae-X rigs to 32. The deployment of these newly built rigs was the primary factor for the increase in 2014 of rig years, operating revenues and adjusted operating income.\nCanada\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a decline in drilling rig activity and dayrates. These declines were the direct result of lower industry activity and pricing pressure from customers resulting from the decline in oil and gas prices. The lower activity is evidenced by a 51% reduction in rig years during 2015 compared to the prior period. The Canadian dollar weakened approximately 19% against the U.S. dollar year-over-year. This also negatively impacted margins, as both revenues and expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars.\nOperating results decreased slightly from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange variance. The Canadian dollar weakened approximately 7% against the U.S. dollar. In addition, the Canada operations were impacted by a decline in average drilling dayrates. These decreases were partially offset by streamlining activities and cost saving initiatives.\nInternational\nOperating results increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in rig count coupled with the incremental revenue associated with our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Nabors Arabia in the second quarter of 2015. Furthermore, our International operations benefitted from the incremental margins associated with deployments of several newly constructed rigs throughout 2014. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rig years in Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Bahrain.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of higher dayrates from existing land rigs in Algeria, Colombia, Northern Iraq, Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as deployments of newly built rigs in Saudi Arabia and Argentina. These increases were partially offset by decreased land drilling activity in Mexico.\nRig Services\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a broad-based decline in revenue-producing activities, including top drives and catwalk sales and the continued decline in financial results in our directional drilling businesses due to intense competition and the low price of oil. The decline in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in operating and general and administrative costs for this segment due to cost-reduction efforts.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to higher demand in the United States and Canada drilling markets for top drives, rig instrumentation and data collection services from oil and gas exploration companies, along with higher third-party rental and RIGWATCH\u00ae units, which generate higher margins. These increases were partially offset by the continued decline in financial results in our directional drilling businesses due to intense competition.\nOTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 324,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 500,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 479,890\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (175,708\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (35)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As a percentage of operating revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.4%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.5)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6.4)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and engineering\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,253\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,445\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (17)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 970,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,145,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,086,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (174,641\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (15)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (75,081\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6,301\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (68,780\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> (6,340\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 181,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 177,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 223,418\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45,470\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (20)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 96,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,523\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (80)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (84,746\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (88)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (39,172\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 9,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48,245\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> (28,904\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (76)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The number is so large that it is not meaningful.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased from 2014 to 2015. Over half of the decrease, approximately $98.5 million, was due to the fact that we no longer consolidate the expenses from our Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger. The remainder of the decrease was attributable to a reduction in workforce and general cost-reduction efforts across the remaining operating units and our corporate offices. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses are slightly higher in 2015 due to the reductions in revenues primarily across the U.S. operating units.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased slightly from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of increased activity across the operating units, particularly within our U.S. and International drilling segments. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses are comparable for each period relative to fluctuations in activity levels.\nResearch and engineering\nResearch and engineering expenses decreased slightly from 2014 to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in workforce and general cost-reduction efforts across the various operating units.\nResearch and engineering expenses increased slightly from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the development of drilling and measurement tools resulting from our acquisition of NES, as well as an increase in personnel as a result of the acquisition of 2TD during October 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to the fact that we no longer consolidate the expenses from our Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger, which accounted for $170.7 million, or 98% of the decrease. The remainder of the decrease was due to the impairment and retirement of rigs and rig components during the fourth quarter of 2014, which more than offset the incremental depreciation attributed to newly constructed rigs, rig upgrades and other capital expenditures made during 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased from 2013 to 2014 as a result of the incremental depreciation expense related to newly constructed rigs placed into service during 2014, and to a lesser extent, rig upgrades and other capital expenditures.\nEarnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates\nEarnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis differences, of our equity method investments, primarily composed of our investment in CJES. We account for our investment in CJES on a one-quarter lag. Accordingly, the year ended December 31, 2015 includes our share of the net income (loss) of CJES from the closing of the Merger until September 30, 2015, resulting in a loss of $81.3 million. The operating losses of CJES for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily due to reduced activity levels driven by lower customer demand stemming from lower oil prices coupled with the further pricing concessions required by the highly competitive environment. Further sustained declines in oil prices and activity levels in the pressure pumping business could impact CJES's operations and the fair value of its assets, resulting in future operating losses.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense was relatively flat from 2014 to 2015. Our average outstanding debt balances during 2015 were lower than those in the corresponding 2014 period, primarily due to the repayment of a portion of our outstanding debt using cash consideration received in connection with the Merger. In addition, due to the downturn in the oil and gas markets, we have curtailed spending on major projects, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest recognized during the period.\nInterest expense decreased from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of the redemptions of $785.4 million of our 9.25% senior notes in September 2013. During 2014, our average outstanding debt balances were similar to the levels of debt outstanding during 2013. However, our average interest rates were lower on those outstanding balances, primarily due to replacing the high coupon 9.25% senior notes in September 2013, with the issuance of $700 million aggregate principal senior notes at lower coupon rates, comprised of $350.0 million principal amount of 2.35% senior notes and $350.0 million principal amount of 5.10% senior notes. Additionally, we expanded the use of our low cost commercial paper program during 2014, resulting in a favorable mix between balances outstanding on the revolving line of credit and commercial paper.\nInvestment income\nInvestment income during 2015 was $2.3 million and included realized gains of $1.9 million attributable to interest and dividend income.\nInvestment income during 2014 was $11.8 million and included $5.6 million of realized gains from short-term and other long-term investments and $6.2 million in interest and dividend income.\nInvestment income during 2013 was $96.6 million and included $89.0 million of realized gains from short-term and other long-term investments and net gains of $2.5 million from our trading securities. The balance was attributable to $5.1 million in interest and dividend income.\nOther expense (income), net\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2015 was $39.2 million of income, which was primarily comprised of a net gain of $47.1 million related to the Merger, inclusive of a $102.2 million gross gain offset by transaction costs and post-closing adjustment, and net gains on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $2.3 million. These gains were partially offset by increases to litigation reserves of $8.2 million and foreign currency exchange losses of $0.4 million.\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2014 was $9.1 million of expense, which was primarily comprised of (i) increases to litigation reserves of $8.9 million, (ii) losses on debt buybacks of $5.6 million and (iii) foreign currency exchange losses of $1.0 million. These losses were partially offset by the net gain on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $8.8 million.\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2013 was $38.0 million of expense, which was primarily comprised of (i) net losses on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $13.6 million, (ii) increases to litigation reserves of $11.7 million, (iii) foreign currency exchange losses of $6.2 million and (iv) losses on debt buybacks of $3.8 million.\nImpairments and Other Charges\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td>

led to considerable reductions in capital spending by some of our customers and has diminished demand for our drilling services. The impact of the industry downturn on our business activity and future outlook resulted in impairments and retirement provisions of approximately $140.1 million, an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in CJES of $180.6 million, and the provision for International operations of $48.3 million during 2015 as discussed below.\nTangible Assets and Equipment\nThe following table summarizes the 2015 retirement and impairment charges for tangible assets and equipment by operating segment:\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Provision for\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tangible Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Retirements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drilling & Rig Services:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rig Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2015, we retired some rigs and rig components in our U.S., Canada and International Drilling operating segments and reduced their carrying value to their estimated salvage value. Due to market conditions and resulting increase in competition in the drilling market, we have experienced a decline in utilization of our remaining legacy rigs. Accordingly, we retired roughly half of our fleet of SCR rigs within the U.S. Drilling operating segment, continuing to market the remaining 47 of our most competitive assets within this group. Additionally, we retired various yard assets within our International operating segment as well as rig-related equipment in our Canada operating segment.\nIn 2015, we also recorded impairments totaling $74.5 million primarily comprised of $52.5 million for an inactive jackup rig in our International operating segment. We recognized an impairment of $15.1 million to our retained interest in the oil and gas properties located on the North Slope of Alaska to reduce the carrying value to fair value, as a result of the sustained decline in oil prices. The balance of the impairment charge primarily relates to obsolete inventory within our Rig Services operating segment.\nOther-than-temporary impairment\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we determined the carrying value of our investment in CJES was other than temporarily impaired which resulted in an impairment charge of $180.6 million to reduce our carrying value to its estimated fair value determined principally based on the average share price over a specified period. The charge directly resulted from reduced activity levels driven by lower customer demand stemming from lower oil prices coupled with further pricing concessions required by the highly competitive environment. Further sustained declines in oil prices and activity levels in the pressure pumping business could impact CJES's operations and the fair value of its assets, resulting in future operating losses. Additionally, as of the date of this annual report, the market price of CJES is trading below our carrying value. Should it remain at these levels for an extended period of time, it could result in a future other-than-temporary impairment.\nProvision for International operations\nDuring 2015, we recognized $25.4 million related to assets and receivables impacted by the degradation of the overall country economy and financial situation in Venezuela, which has been adversely affected by the downturn in oil prices, primarily comprised of a loss of $10.0 million related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets denominated in local currency from the official exchange rate of 6.3 Bolivares per US dollar to the SIMADI exchange rate which was 199 Bolivares per US dollar as of September 30, 2015 and $15.4 million related to the write-off of a receivable balance. The balance of this provision represents an obligation associated with the decision to exit a non-core business line in another country within the region of $22.9 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014\nTangible Assets and Equipment\nThe following table summarizes the 2014 retirement and impairment charges for tangible assets and equipment by operating segment:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Provision for\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tangible Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Retirements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drilling & Rig Services:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 271,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 137,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 408,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,211\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rig Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 393,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 217,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 611,589\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately two-thirds of the 2014 charges from drilling rigs and rig equipment is related to the U.S. lower 48 legacy rig fleet. Given the sharp decline in crude oil prices and the resulting impact on our customers' spending programs that we experienced in 2014, and the disproportionate impact of the reduced activity that we believe our legacy rig fleet will absorb, we have retired 25 mechanical rigs and impaired our fleet of SCR rigs, including the resultant retirement of and reduction in yard assets and spare rig components associated with a reduced overall size of our working rig fleet.\nAlso included in the 2014 charges for our U.S. drilling rigs and rig equipment is a retirement provision of approximately $54.4 million for our Gulf of Mexico jackup fleet. This market has been challenged for the past several years and we believe the drop in oil prices will exacerbate the lack of demand for these rigs. The majority of these rigs would require substantial amounts of capital in order for them to be operable again.\nThe balance of the drilling rigs and rig equipment charges relate to our coil tubing drilling rig fleet in Canada and various under-utilized or under-performing rigs or asset classes throughout our International and Canada drilling fleets. We also recognized an impairment charge related to obsolete inventory within our Rig Services operating segment.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nDuring 2014, we recognized an impairment of goodwill totaling $356.6 million, the majority of which was for the remaining goodwill balance of $335.0 million in our Completion Services operating segment related to the acquisition of Superior in 2010. The value attributable to the Merger with CJES declined sharply beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, with a drop in the market price of CJES's stock and the agreed upon reduction to the amount of cash we expect to receive from this transaction. The combination of these events and a sharp decline in the market price of our stock, led us to believe that a triggering event had occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we performed an impairment test on our remaining goodwill balances. We determined that our Completion Services goodwill balances should be fully impaired. The balance of the impairment relates to $21.6 million in goodwill related to Ryan Directional Services, Inc. our directional drilling operations included in our Rig Services operating segment. The decline in oil prices and the impact it had on our businesses, along with the lack of certainty surrounding an eventual recovery, led us to impair these goodwill balances.\nAdditionally, during 2014, we recognized an impairment of $29.9 million primarily related to various intangible assets, such as customer relationships within our Completion & Production Services and Rig Services operating segments related to previous acquisitions.\nTransaction costs\nDuring 2014, we incurred $22.3 million in transaction costs related to the Merger with CJES, including professional fees and other costs incurred to reorganize the business in contemplation of the Merger.\nOther-than-temporary impairment\nDuring 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $7.0 million related to an equity security. Because the trading price of this security remained below our cost basis for an extended period, we determined the investment was other than temporarily impaired and it was appropriate to write down the investment's carrying value to its current estimated fair value.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013\nProvision for retirement of long-lived assets\nDuring 2013, we recorded a provision for retirement of long-lived assets in multiple operating segments totaling $14.0 million, which reduced the carrying value of some assets to their salvage value. The retirements related to assets in Saudi Arabia and included obsolete top-drives, nonworking trucks, generators, engines and other miscellaneous equipment. The retirements in our Canada operations included functionally inoperable rigs and other drilling equipment. In our Completion & Production Services operations, the retirements related to rigs and vehicles that would require significant repair to return to work and other non-core assets.\nImpairments of long-lived assets\nDuring 2013, we recognized an impairment of $20.0 million to our fleet of coil-tubing units in our Completion & Production Services business. Intense competition and oversupply of equipment has led to lower utilization and margins for this product line. When these factors were considered as part of our annual impairment tests on long-lived assets, the sum of the estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, was less than the carrying amount of these assets. The estimated fair values of these assets were calculated using discounted cash flow models involving assumptions based on our utilization of the assets, revenues and direct costs, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We believe the fair value estimated for purposes of these tests represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. In 2013, we suspended our coil-tubing operations in the United States.\nLoss on tendered notes\nDuring 2013, we recognized a loss related to the extinguishment of debt in connection with the tender offer for our 9.25% senior notes. See Note 11-Debt for additional discussion. In 2013, we completed a cash tender offer for these notes and repurchased $785.4 million aggregate principal amount. We paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in cash, reflecting principal and accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment premium and recognized a loss as part of the debt extinguishment.\nProvision for termination of employment contract\nDuring 2013, we recognized a one-time stock grant valued at $27.0 million, which vested immediately, and $18.0 million in cash awarded and paid to Mr. Petrello in connection with the termination of his prior employment agreement. See Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion.\nIncome tax rate\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective income tax rate from continuing operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.4)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.0)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.3%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 320%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.6%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe change in our worldwide effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 is primarily attributable to the tax effect of the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings (losses), including greater losses in higher-tax jurisdictions. The tax effect of impairments and internal restructuring also contributed to the change.\nThe change in our worldwide effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is primarily attributable to the tax effect related to impairments and internal restructuring. The change in geographic mix of pre-tax earnings also contributed to the change.\nAssets Held-for-Sale\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 73,578\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 75,678\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The carrying value of these assets was reduced by $51.0 million to reflect current fair value, due to the deterioration of economic conditions in the dry gas market in western Canada. The impairment charge is reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in our consolidated statement of income (loss) as outlined below.\nOil and Gas Properties\nThe carrying value of our assets held for sale represents the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We continue to market these properties at prices that are reasonable compared to current fair value.\nWe have contracts with pipeline companies to pay specified fees based on committed volumes for gas transport and processing associated with these properties held for sale. In December 2013, we entered into agreements to restructure these contracts, assigning a portion of the obligation to third parties and reducing our future payment commitments. At December 31, 2015, our undiscounted contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $23.3 million, and we had liabilities of $16.1 million, $5.2 million of which were classified as current and are included in accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2014, our undiscounted contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $84.6 million, and we had liabilities of $40.2 million, $19.6 million of which were classified as current and are included in accrued liabilities.\nThe amounts at each balance sheet date represented our best estimate of the fair value of the excess capacity of the pipeline commitments calculated using a discounted cash flow model, when considering our disposal plan, current production levels, natural gas prices and expected utilization of the pipeline over the remaining contractual term. Decreases in actual production or natural gas prices could result in future charges related to excess pipeline commitments.\nDiscontinued Operations\nOur condensed statements of income (loss) from discontinued operations for each operating segment were as follows:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Increase/(Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2015 to 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2014 to 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9,931\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (76)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (12,184\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (48)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rig Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 127,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (127,154\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (100)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from discontinued operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Oil and Gas\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (40,438\n</td> <td> )(1)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (27,396\n</td> <td> )(2)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (40,459\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> n/m\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rig Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,359\n</td> <td> )(3)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,217\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,359\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (100)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (16,217\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (100)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOil and Gas\n(1) Includes a $51.0 million impairment charge due to the deterioration of economic conditions in the dry gas market in western Canada, partially offset by a gain related to our restructuring of our future pipeline obligations.\n(2) Includes a $61.5 million impairment charge to write down the carrying value of some of our wholly owned oil and gas-centered assets, partially offset by a gain related to our restructuring of our future pipeline obligations.\nRig Services\n(3) Reflects an impairment charge for a note receivable of $3.1 million remaining from the sale of one of our former Canada subsidiaries that provided logistics services.\n(4) Includes a gain recognized from the sale of Peak, one of our businesses in Alaska, for which we received cash proceeds of $135.5 million\n(5) Number is so large that it is not meaningful.\nDuring 2014, we sold a large portion of our interest in oil and gas proved properties located on the North Slope of Alaska. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $35.1 million at closing and expect to receive additional payments of $27.0 million upon certain future dates or the properties achieving certain production targets. In the event these production targets are not met and payments not received, our recourse would be to reclaim the properties. We retained both a working interest and an overriding royalty interest in the properties. The working interest is fully carried up to $600 million of total project costs. The $22.2 million gain from the transaction is included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The retained interest, which was valued at approximately $16.4 million as of December 31, 2015, is no longer classified as assets-held-for-sale and is included in other long-term assets. We have not recast prior period results as the balances are not material to our consolidated statements of income (loss) for any period.\nAdditional discussion of our policy pertaining to the calculations of our annual impairment tests, including any impairment of goodwill, is set forth in Critical Accounting Estimates below in this section and in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Additional information relating to discontinued operations is provided in Note 4-Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A further protraction of lower commodity prices or an inability to sell these assets in a timely manner could result in recognition of future impairment charges.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows\nOur cash flows depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Sustained decreases in the price of oil or natural gas could have a material impact on these activities, and could also materially affect our cash flows. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures or acquisitions, purchases and sales of investments, loans, issuances and repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. We discuss our 2015 and 2014 cash flows below.\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $856.6 million during 2015, compared to $1.8 billion during 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities (\u201coperating cash flows\u201d) is our primary source of capital and liquidity. Factors affecting changes in operating cash flows are largely the same as those that impact net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, depletion, impairments, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and our proportionate share of earnings or losses from unconsolidated affiliates. Net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash components was approximately $871.1 million and $1.3 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, changes in working capital items such as collection of receivables can be a significant component of operating cash flows. Changes in working capital items used $14.6 million and provided $487.8 million in cash flows during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $227.5 million during 2015 compared to $1.7 billion in 2014. Our primary use of cash for investing activities is for capital expenditures related to rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, as well as sustaining capital expenditures. During 2015 and 2014, we used cash for capital expenditures totaling $867.1 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\nIn 2015, we received proceeds related to the Merger of $650.1 million. We also received $68.2 million in proceeds from sales of assets and insurance claims. Additionally, we used cash of $57.9 million (net of cash acquired) to purchase our remaining interest in Nabors Arabia.\nIn 2014, we used cash of $40.3 million to purchase 2TD. We also received $156.8 million in proceeds from sales of our oil and gas assets, other non-core operations and insurance claims.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $849.9 million during 2015. In 2015, we repaid net amounts of $975.1 million under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. During 2015, we paid cash dividends of $69.4 million. Additionally, we received proceeds of $325.0 million from our term loan facility which was used to pay down our commercial paper program mentioned above.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $69.8 million during 2014. In 2014, we repaid net amounts of $27.7 million under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. During 2014, we paid cash dividends of $59.1 million.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nWe expect capital expenditures over the next 12 months to approximate $0.5-$0.6 billion. However, this amount could change significantly based on market conditions, our strategy and new business opportunities. Purchase commitments outstanding at December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $216.9 million, primarily for rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, as well as sustaining capital expenditures, other operating expenses and purchases of inventory. The level of our outstanding purchase commitments and our expected level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months reflect a number of capital programs that are currently underway or planned. These programs will result in an expansion in the number of land drilling and offshore rigs and the amount of well-servicing equipment and technology assets that we own and operate. We have the ability to reduce the planned expenditures if necessary or increase them if market conditions and new business opportunities warrant it.\nIn light of the recent decline in crude oil prices, we have already undertaken many cost cutting initiatives in an effort to minimize the negative impact to our business. We have undertaken efforts to reduce capital expenditures, operating costs and administrative expenses. Additionally, we have strengthened our financial flexibility by streamlining operations, shedding non-core businesses and reducing net debt and interest expense. Our long-term debt obligations, as structured, have staggering maturities as well as excess capacity to help us weather the current downturn in the oil and gas market.\nWe have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations. Several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of debt or our common shares. Future acquisitions may be funded using existing cash or by issuing debt or additional shares of our stock. Such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors.\nOn August 25, 2015, our Board authorized a share repurchase program (the \u201cprogram\u201d) under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to $400 million of our common shares by various means, including in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This authorization does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any of our common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 10.6 million of our common shares for approximately $99.6 million under this program. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining amount authorized under the program that may be used to purchase shares was $300.4 million. The shares held by our subsidiaries are registered and tradeable subject to securities laws and have the same voting and other rights as other outstanding shares. See Note 23-Subsequent Events.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, both in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may involve material amounts.\nSee our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods included below under \u201cOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)\u201d.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> < 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual cash obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,679,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 348,000\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,086,113\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,195,387\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,050,000\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 779,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 324,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 216,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employment contracts (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation and processing contracts (6)(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above excludes liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $32.1 million as of December 31, 2015 because we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities.

See Notes 4-Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and 17-Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2015, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share. This quarterly cash dividend was paid on December 31, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 10, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash dividends totaling $69.4 million. See Item 5.-Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity-Dividends.\nFinancial Condition and Sources of Liquidity\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and investments, availability under our revolving credit facility, our commercial paper program and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and short-term investments of $274.6 million and working capital of $0.5 billion. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and short-term investments of $536.2 million and working capital of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2015, we had $2.24 billion availability remaining under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.\nDuring 2015, we entered into an amendment to our existing committed, unsecured revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to $2.2 billion, extend the maturity date to July 2020 and increase the size of the accordion option to\n$500.0 million. We subsequently exercised $50.0 million of the accordion option to bring the total availability to $2.25 billion. We expect to use this capacity to provide financial flexibility for strategic investment opportunities, debt refinancing and other corporate uses. Additionally, Nabors Industries, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a new five-year unsecured term loan facility for $325.0 million. The term loan facility contains a mandatory prepayment of $162.5 million due in 2018. We used this facility to pay down our commercial paper borrowings during 2015.\nWe had 11 letter-of-credit facilities with various banks as of December 31, 2015. Availability under these facilities as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit available\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 657,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Letters of credit outstanding, inclusive of financial and performance guarantees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 211,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Remaining availability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 445,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States and our historical ability to access these markets as needed. While there can be no assurances that we will be able to access these markets in the future, we believe that we will be able to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligation that might arise upon exchange or purchase of our notes and that any cash payment due, in addition to our other cash obligations, would not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations. See Part 1A.-Risk Factors-A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.\nOur gross debt to capital ratio was 0.46:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 0.47:1 as of December 31, 2014, respectively. Our net debt to capital ratio was 0.44:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 0.43:1 as of December 31, 2014. The gross debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing (x) total debt by (y) total capital. Total capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders' equity. Net debt is total debt minus the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Neither the gross debt to capital ratio nor the net debt to capital ratio is a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nOur interest coverage ratio was 6.2:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 9.8:1 as of December 31, 2014. The interest coverage ratio is a trailing 12-month quotient of the sum of (x) operating revenues, direct costs, general administrative expenses and research and engineering expenses divided by (y) interest expense. The interest coverage ratio is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nWe are a holding company and therefore rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flows from our operating subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flows to make payments of interest and principal to us. See Part I., Item 1A.-Risk Factors-As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.\nOur current cash and investments, projected cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility are expected to adequately finance our purchase commitments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, scheduled debt service requirements, and all other expected cash requirements for the next 12 months.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)\nWe are a party to some transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as \u201coff-balance sheet arrangements\u201d that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations under which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these agreements serve as guarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers' compensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve as guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our share transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees. Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote.\nThe following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial guarantees issued by Nabors:\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial standby letters of credit and other financial surety instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 237,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. We analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n\u00b7 it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and\n\u00b7 changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nFor a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nDepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment. The drilling, workover and well-servicing industries are very capital intensive. Property, plant and equipment represented 74% of our total assets as of December 31, 2015, and depreciation and amortization constituted 23% of our total costs and other deductions in 2015.\nDepreciation for our primary operating assets, drilling and workover rigs, is calculated based on the units-of-production method. For each day a rig is operating, we depreciate it over an approximate 4,927-day period, with the exception of our jackup rigs which are depreciated over an 8,030-day period, after provision for salvage value. For each day a rig asset is not operating, it is depreciated over an assumed depreciable life of 20 years, with the exception of our jackup rigs, where a 30-year depreciable life is typically used, after provision for salvage value.\nDepreciation on our buildings, well-servicing rigs, oilfield hauling and mobile equipment, marine transportation and supply vessels, aircraft equipment, and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value (buildings-10 to 30 years; well-servicing rigs-3 to 15 years; marine transportation and supply vessels-10 to 25 years; aircraft equipment-5 to 20 years; oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment-3 to 10 years).\nThese depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property, plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets. Periodically, we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets. Estimation of these items requires significant management judgment. Accordingly, management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property, plant and equipment are critical.\nThere have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets, changes in technology or other factors indicating that these estimates do not continue to be appropriate. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property, plant and equipment, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation, or the methodology applied. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management's assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. As discussed above, the drilling, workover and well-servicing industry is very capital intensive. We review our assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying\namounts may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset's recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows requires the estimation of dayrates and utilization, and such estimates can change based on market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. Significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could result in future impairments. As the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long-lived assets is subject to significant management judgment, and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income (loss), management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long-lived assets are critical.\nAssumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows.\nFor an asset classified as held for sale, we consider the asset impaired when its carrying amount exceeds fair value less its cost to sell. Fair value is determined in the same manner as an impaired long-lived asset that is held and used.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the second quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value. We perform our impairment tests for goodwill for all of our reporting units within our operating segments. Our Drilling & Rig Services business consists of U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services operating segments. Our Rig Services operating segment includes Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd. and Ryan Directional Services, Inc. The impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. This second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nThe fair values calculated in these impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving assumptions based on our utilization of rigs or other oil and gas service equipment, revenues and earnings from affiliates, as well as direct costs, general and administrative costs, depreciation, applicable income taxes, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our discounted cash flow projections for each reporting unit were based on financial forecasts. The future cash flows were discounted to present value using discount rates that are determined to be appropriate for each reporting unit. Terminal values for each reporting unit were calculated using a Gordon Growth methodology with a long-term growth rate of 3%. We believe the fair value estimated for purposes of these tests represent a Level 3 fair value measurement.\nA significantly prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices or changes in laws and regulations could continue to adversely affect the demand for and prices of our services, which could result in future goodwill impairment charges for other reporting units due to the potential impact on our estimate of our future operating results.\nIncome Taxes. We operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We are currently contesting tax assessments throughout the world and may contest future assessments. We believe the ultimate resolution of the outstanding assessments, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We recognize uncertain tax positions that we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any existing or future assessments.\nAudit claims of approximately $180.0 million attributable to income, customs and other business taxes have been assessed against us. We have contested, or intend to contest, these assessments, including through litigation if necessary, and we believe the ultimate resolution, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Tax authorities may issue additional assessments or pursue legal actions as a result of tax audits and we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such assessments and legal actions.\nApplicable income and withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries. We do not intend to repatriate such undistributed earnings except for distributions upon which incremental income and withholding taxes would not be material.\nIn certain jurisdictions we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. Judgment and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially utilized. When we estimate that all or some portion of certain deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized, we establish a valuation allowance for\nthe amount ascertained to be unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for future utilization of our deferred assets. Any change in the ability to utilize such deferred assets will be accounted for in the period of the event affecting the valuation allowance. If facts and circumstances cause us to change our expectations regarding future tax consequences, the resulting adjustments could have a material effect on our financial results or cash flow.\nLitigation and Self-Insurance Reserves. Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well-servicing industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations are also subject to the hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision and other damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are subject to risks of war or acts of terrorism, civil disturbances and other political events.\nAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. There is no assurance that our insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention.\nBased on the risks discussed above, it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Reserves related to self-insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of self-insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. We maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self-insurance retentions for workers' compensation, employers' liability, general liability and automobile liability claims. These accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims. These loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid.\nBecause the determination of our liability for self-insured claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, and because such liabilities could be material in nature, management believes that accounting estimates related to self-insurance reserves are critical.\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes were made to the methodology used to estimate insurance reserves. For purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if the December 31, 2015 reserves were adjusted by 10%, total costs and other deductions would change by $16.6 million, or .39%.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as discussed in Note 6-Fair Value Measurements in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In conjunction with our accounting for these acquisitions, it was necessary for us to estimate the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the various business combinations using various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment, and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management's assumptions and could result in lower estimates of values of acquired assets or of future cash flows. This could result in impairment charges being recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss). As the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical.\nThe determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities is based on the market for the assets and the settlement value of the liabilities. These estimates are made by management based on our experience with similar assets and liabilities. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes were made to the methodology utilized to value assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have proved to be reliable in the past.", "item_7_truncated": "\n(6) Adjusted operating income (loss) is computed by subtracting the sum of direct costs, general and administrative expenses, research and engineering expenses and depreciation and amortization from operating revenues. Adjusted operating income (loss) is a non-GAAP measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of our operating segments and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because we believe that these financial measures accurately reflect our ongoing profitability and performance. In addition, securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze our performance. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided in the above table.\nTangible Assets and Equipment\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the second quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value. We perform our impairment tests for goodwill for all of our reporting units within our operating segments. Our Drilling & Rig Services business consists of U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services operating segments.

This second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nIn 2015, we received proceeds related to the Merger of $650.1 million. We also received $68.2 million in proceeds from sales of assets and insurance claims. Additionally, we used cash of $57.9 million (net of cash acquired) to purchase our remaining interest in Nabors Arabia.\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> < 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual cash obligations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,679,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 348,000\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,086,113\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,195,387\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,050,000\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 779,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 324,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 85,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (7)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 216,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 204,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employment contracts (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,999\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transportation and processing contracts (6)(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,723\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLitigation and Self-Insurance Reserves.

Our operations are subject to risks of war or acts of terrorism, civil disturbances and other political events.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased from 2013 to 2014 as a result of the incremental depreciation expense related to newly constructed rigs placed into service during 2014, and to a lesser extent, rig upgrades and other capital expenditures.\nTable 25: <table> <tr>

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $856.6 million during 2015, compared to $1.8 billion during 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities (\u201coperating cash flows\u201d) is our primary source of capital and liquidity. Factors affecting changes in operating cash flows are largely the same as those that impact net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, depletion, impairments, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and our proportionate share of earnings or losses from unconsolidated affiliates. Net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash components was approximately $871.1 million and $1.3 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, changes in working capital items such as collection of receivables can be a significant component of operating cash flows. Changes in working capital items used $14.6 million and provided $487.8 million in cash flows during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $2.24 billion availability remaining under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, which expires July 2020. Availability under the revolving credit facility is subject to a covenant not to exceed a net debt to capital ratio of 0.60:1. As of December 31, 2015, our net debt to capital ratio was 0.44:1. See Item 6. \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d.\n\nWe had 11 letter-of-credit facilities with various banks as of December 31, 2015. Availability under these facilities as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:\nRig Services\nIn 2015, we also recorded impairments totaling $74.5 million primarily comprised of $52.5 million for an inactive jackup rig in our International operating segment. We recognized an impairment of $15.1 million to our retained interest in the oil and gas properties located on the North Slope of Alaska to reduce the carrying value to fair value, as a result of the sustained decline in oil prices. The balance of the impairment charge primarily relates to obsolete inventory within our Rig Services operating segment.\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December

During 2015 and 2014, we used cash for capital expenditures totaling $867.1 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\nResearch and engineering expenses increased slightly from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the development of drilling and measurement tools resulting from our acquisition of NES, as well as an increase in personnel as a result of the acquisition of 2TD during October 2014.\nRig Services\n(9) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates, which totaled 2.5 years in 2014 and 2013.

Furthermore, our International operations benefitted from the incremental margins associated with deployments of several newly constructed rigs throughout 2014. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rig years in Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Bahrain.\nTable 18: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Provision for\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tangible Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Retirements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Impairments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Drilling & Rig Services:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,839\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rig Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 65,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,464\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 140,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 2.35% senior notes due September 2016.\nThe change in our worldwide effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 is primarily attributable to the tax effect of the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings (losses), including greater losses in higher-tax jurisdictions.

committed volumes for gas transport and processing associated with these properties held for sale. In December 2013, we entered into agreements to restructure these contracts, assigning a portion of the obligation to third parties and reducing our future payment commitments. At December 31, 2015, our undiscounted contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $23.3 million, and we had liabilities of $16.1 million, $5.2 million of which were classified as current and are included in accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2014, our undiscounted contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $84.6 million, and we had liabilities of $40.2 million, $19.6 million of which were classified as current and are included in accrued liabilities.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, both in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may involve material amounts.\nDue to the decline in oil prices and customers' reduced drilling activity, we have experienced a decline in our dayrates as well as the average number of rigs operating, most notably in the lower 48 states. In our U.S. Drilling operating segment, our rig years (a measure of activity and utilization) have decreased from 212.5 years during fiscal year 2014 to 120.0 years during fiscal year 2015. In our Canada Drilling operating segment, our rig years have declined by roughly 51% from 2014. Our International operating segment has not been immune from the impact of lower oil prices. Although international drilling markets tend to react slower than the North American markets, we began to experience downward pressure on dayrates in the International segment beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Our International rig years declined in the latter half of 2015, primarily due to the conclusion of several drilling projects as well as reduced activity resulting from lower commodity prices. Given the commodity price environment entering 2016, we expect continued erosion at least through the first half of the year in industry rig counts, both domestic and international, as well as continued downward pressure on the utilization and pricing of\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nDuring 2015, we entered into an amendment to

rigs or other oil and gas service equipment, revenues and earnings from affiliates, as well as direct costs, general and administrative costs, depreciation, applicable income taxes, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our discounted cash flow projections for each reporting unit were based on financial forecasts. The future cash flows were discounted to present value using discount rates that are determined to be appropriate for each reporting unit. Terminal values for each reporting unit were calculated using a Gordon Growth methodology with a long-term growth rate of 3%. We believe the fair value estimated for purposes of these tests represent a Level 3 fair value measurement.\nResearch and engineering\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2013 was $38.0 million of expense, which was primarily comprised of (i) net losses on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $13.6 million, (ii) increases to litigation reserves of $11.7 million, (iii) foreign currency exchange losses of $6.2 million and (iv) losses on debt buybacks of $3.8 million.\nWe have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations. Several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of debt or our common shares. Future acquisitions may be funded using existing cash or by issuing debt or additional shares of our stock. Such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors.\nThe impairments and retirement provisions stemmed from the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the resulting impact on our customers' spending programs and demand for our services. The impairments and retirement provisions were comprised of approximately $611.6 million in charges related to drilling rigs and rig equipment and $386.5 million in impairments to our goodwill and intangible assets. The goodwill and intangible assets were primarily attributable to our Completion Services operating segment from the acquisition of Superior Well Services, Inc. (\u201cSuperior\u201d) in 2010. Of the $611.6 million in charges related to our drilling rigs and rig equipment, the majority is attributable to retirements and impairments to our lower 48 legacy rig fleet (non AC rigs), including the functional retirement of 25 mechanical rigs, an impairment to the SCR fleet and the resultant reduction in yard assets and spare rig components due to reduced operating fleet size. The balance is attributable to charges for the impairment or retirement of our jackup rig fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, our coil tubing drilling rigs in Canada and various other under-utilized rigs and related equipment in Canada and our international markets.\nDuring 2013, we recognized an impairment of $20.0 million to our fleet of coil-tubing units in our Completion & Production Services business. Intense competition and oversupply of equipment has led to lower utilization and margins for this product line. When these factors were considered as part of our annual impairment tests on long-lived assets, the sum of the estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, was less than the carrying amount of these assets. The estimated fair values of these assets were calculated using discounted cash flow models involving assumptions based on our utilization of the assets, revenues and direct costs, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We believe the fair value estimated for purposes of these tests represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. In 2013, we suspended our coil-tubing operations in the United States.\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Provision for\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Tangible Asset\n</td> <td>\n</td>

See Note 11-Debt for additional discussion. In 2013, we completed a cash tender offer for these notes and repurchased $785.4 million aggregate principal amount. We paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in cash, reflecting principal and accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment premium and recognized a loss as part of the debt extinguishment.\nApproximately two-thirds of the 2014 charges from drilling rigs and rig equipment is related to the U.S. lower 48 legacy rig fleet. Given the sharp decline in crude oil prices and the resulting impact on our customers' spending programs that we experienced in 2014, and the disproportionate impact of the reduced activity that we believe our legacy rig fleet will absorb, we have retired 25 mechanical rigs and impaired our fleet of SCR rigs, including the resultant retirement of and reduction in yard assets and spare rig components associated with a reduced overall size of our working rig fleet.\nAudit claims of approximately $180.0 million attributable to income, customs and other business taxes have been assessed against us. We have contested, or intend to contest, these assessments, including through litigation if necessary, and we believe the ultimate resolution, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Tax authorities may issue additional assessments or pursue legal actions as a result of tax audits and we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such assessments and legal actions.\nThe amounts at each balance sheet date represented our best estimate of the fair value of the excess capacity of the pipeline commitments calculated using a discounted cash flow model, when considering our disposal plan, current production levels, natural gas prices and expected utilization of the pipeline over the remaining contractual term. Decreases in actual production or natural gas prices could result in future charges related to excess pipeline commitments.\n(8) We have contracts with pipeline companies to pay specified fees based on committed volumes for gas transport and processing, as calculated on a monthly basis. See Notes 4-Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and 17-Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe table above excludes liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $32.1 million as of December 31, 2015 because we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Further details on the uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 12-Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFinancial Results\nInterest expense\n(5) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther-than-temporary impairment\n(4) Includes a gain recognized from the sale of Peak, one of our businesses in Alaska, for which we received cash proceeds of $135.5 million\namounts may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset's recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows requires the estimation of dayrates and utilization, and such estimates can change based on market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. Significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could result in future impairments. As the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long-lived assets is subject to significant management judgment, and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income (loss), management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long-lived assets are critical.\n\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe are a holding company and therefore rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flows from our operating subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flows to make payments of interest and principal to us. See Part I., Item 1A.-Risk Factors-As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.\nInternational\n(3) Reflects an impairment charge for a note receivable of $3.1 million remaining from the sale of one of our former Canada subsidiaries that provided logistics services.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of higher dayrates from existing land rigs in Algeria, Colombia, Northern Iraq, Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as deployments of newly built rigs in Saudi Arabia and Argentina. These increases were partially offset by decreased land drilling activity in Mexico.\nIn light of the recent decline in crude oil prices, we have already undertaken many cost cutting initiatives in an effort to minimize the negative impact to our business. We have undertaken efforts to reduce capital expenditures, operating costs and administrative expenses. Additionally, we have strengthened our financial flexibility by streamlining operations, shedding non-core businesses and reducing net debt and interest expense. Our long-term debt obligations, as structured, have staggering maturities as well as excess capacity to help us weather the current downturn in the oil and gas market.\nAssets Held-for-Sale\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $69.8 million during 2014. In 2014, we repaid net amounts of $27.7 million under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. During 2014, we paid cash dividends of $59.1 million.\n(7) Represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis difference, of our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method, inclusive of $(81.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to our share of the net loss of CJES, which we report on a one-quarter lag.\nInvestment income during 2013 was $96.6 million and included $89.0 million of realized gains from short-term and other long-term investments and net gains of $2.5 million from our trading securities. The balance was attributable to $5.1 million in interest and dividend income.\nDuring 2014, we recognized an impairment of goodwill totaling $356.6 million, the majority of which was for the remaining goodwill balance of $335.0 million in our Completion Services operating segment related to the acquisition of Superior in 2010. The value attributable to the Merger with CJES declined sharply beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, with a drop in the market price of CJES's stock and the agreed upon reduction to the amount of cash we expect to receive from this transaction. The combination of these events and a sharp decline in the market price of our stock, led us to believe that a triggering event had occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we performed an impairment test on our remaining goodwill balances. We determined that our Completion Services goodwill balances should be fully impaired. The balance of the impairment relates to $21.6 million in goodwill related to Ryan Directional Services, Inc. our directional drilling operations included in our Rig Services operating segment. The decline in oil prices and the impact it had on our businesses, along with the lack of certainty surrounding an eventual recovery, led us to impair these goodwill balances.\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a decline in drilling activity in the lower 48 states, reflected by a 44% reduction in rig years during 2015 compared to the prior period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower oil prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and diminished demand as customers released rigs and delayed drilling projects in response to the significant drop in oil prices. The decline in revenue in the lower 48 states was partially offset by a decrease in operating and general and administrative costs for this segment due to cost reduction efforts.\nAssumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows.\nour rig fleets.\nOil and Gas Properties\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and investments, availability under our revolving credit facility, our commercial paper program and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and short-term investments of $274.6 million and working capital of $0.5 billion. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and short-term investments of $536.2 million and working capital of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2015, we had $2.24 billion availability remaining under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.\nApplicable income and withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries. We do not intend to repatriate such undistributed earnings except for distributions upon which incremental income and withholding taxes would not be material.\nTangible Assets and Equipment\nDepreciation on our buildings, well-servicing rigs, oilfield hauling and mobile equipment, marine transportation and supply vessels, aircraft equipment, and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value (buildings-10 to 30 years; well-servicing rigs-3 to 15 years; marine transportation and supply vessels-10 to 25 years; aircraft equipment-5 to 20 years; oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment-3 to 10 years).\nDuring 2015, we recognized $25.4 million related to assets and receivables impacted by the degradation of the overall country economy and financial situation in Venezuela, which has been adversely affected by the downturn in oil prices, primarily comprised of a loss of $10.0 million related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets denominated in local currency from the official exchange rate of 6.3 Bolivares per US dollar to the SIMADI exchange rate which was 199 Bolivares per US dollar as of September 30, 2015 and $15.4 million related to the write-off of a receivable balance. The balance of this provision represents an obligation associated with the decision to exit a non-core business line in another country within the region of $22.9 million.\nImpairments and Other Charges\nWe expect capital expenditures over the next 12 months to approximate $0.5-$0.6 billion. However, this amount could change significantly based on market conditions, our strategy and new business opportunities. Purchase commitments outstanding at December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $216.9 million, primarily for rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, as well as sustaining capital expenditures, other operating expenses and purchases of inventory. The level of our outstanding purchase commitments and our expected level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months reflect a number of capital programs that are currently underway or planned. These programs will result in an expansion in the number of land drilling and offshore rigs and the amount of well-servicing equipment and technology assets that we own and operate. We have the ability to reduce the planned expenditures if necessary or increase them if market conditions and new business opportunities warrant it.\n\n(3) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 6.15% senior notes due February 2018 and mandatory prepayment under the term loan facility due September 2018.\nProvision for termination of employment contract\n(3) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions.\nBased on the risks discussed above, it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Reserves related to self-insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of self-insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. We maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self-insurance retentions for workers' compensation, employers' liability, general liability and automobile liability claims. These accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims. These loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid.\n\nDuring 2013, we recognized a one-time stock grant valued at $27.0 million, which vested immediately, and $18.0 million in cash awarded and paid to Mr. Petrello in connection with the termination of his prior employment agreement. See Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as discussed in Note 6-Fair Value Measurements in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In conjunction with our accounting for these acquisitions, it was necessary for us to estimate the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the various business combinations using various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment, and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management's assumptions and could result in lower estimates of values of acquired assets or of future cash flows. This could result in impairment charges being recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss). As the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical.\n(5) Number is so large that it is not meaningful.\n\nFinancial Condition and Sources of Liquidity\n\nThere have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets, changes in technology or other factors indicating that these estimates do not continue to be appropriate. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property, plant and equipment, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation, or the methodology applied. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management's assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets.\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2015 was $39.2 million of income, which was primarily comprised of a net gain of $47.1 million related to the Merger, inclusive of a $102.2 million gross gain offset by transaction costs and post-closing adjustment, and net gains on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $2.3 million. These gains were partially offset by increases to litigation reserves of $8.2 million and foreign currency exchange losses of $0.4 million.\nOur interest coverage ratio was 6.2:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 9.8:1 as of December 31, 2014. The interest coverage ratio is a trailing 12-month quotient of the sum of (x) operating revenues, direct costs, general administrative expenses and research and engineering expenses divided by (y) interest expense. The interest coverage ratio is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nBecause the determination of our liability for self-insured claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, and because such liabilities could be material in nature, management believes that accounting estimates related to self-insurance reserves are critical.\nU.S.\n\nEarnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates\nProvision for retirement of long-lived assets\nFor a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOur gross debt to capital ratio was 0.46:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 0.47:1 as of December 31, 2014, respectively. Our net debt to capital ratio was 0.44:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 0.43:1 as of December 31, 2014. The gross debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing (x) total debt by (y) total capital. Total capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders' equity. Net debt is total debt minus the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Neither the gross debt to capital ratio nor the net debt to capital ratio is a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities is based on the market for the assets and the settlement value of the liabilities. These estimates are made by management based on our experience with similar assets and liabilities. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes were made to the methodology utilized to value assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have proved to be reliable in the past.\n(10) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well-servicing rig fleet operated during the year. This fleet was included in the Completion & Production Services business that was merged with C&J Energy in March 2015 and we will therefore no longer report this performance metric.\nAlso included in the 2014 charges for our U.S. drilling rigs and rig equipment is a retirement provision of approximately $54.4 million for our Gulf of Mexico jackup fleet. This market has been challenged for the past several years and we believe the drop in oil prices will exacerbate the lack of demand for these rigs. The majority of these rigs would require substantial amounts of capital in order for them to be operable again.\n(8) Excludes well-servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Rig years represent a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365-day period represents 0.5 rig years.\nInterest expense decreased from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of the redemptions of $785.4 million of our 9.25% senior notes in September 2013. During 2014, our average outstanding debt balances were similar to the levels of debt outstanding during 2013. However, our average interest rates were lower on those outstanding balances, primarily due to replacing the high coupon 9.25% senior notes in September 2013, with the issuance of $700 million aggregate principal senior notes at lower coupon rates, comprised of $350.0 million principal amount of 2.35% senior notes and $350.0 million principal amount of 5.10% senior notes. Additionally, we expanded the use of our low cost commercial paper program during 2014, resulting in a favorable mix between balances outstanding on the revolving line of credit and commercial paper.\nLoss on tendered notes\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2014 was $9.1 million of expense, which was primarily comprised of (i) increases to litigation reserves of $8.9 million, (ii) losses on debt buybacks of $5.6 million and (iii) foreign currency exchange losses of $1.0 million. These losses were partially offset by the net gain on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $8.8 million.\nCanada\n(4) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 9.25% senior notes due January 2019, amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility and issued under our commercial paper program, which expires July 2020, 5.0% senior notes due September 2020 and borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility due September 2020.\nDrilling & Rig Services\nFor an asset classified as held for sale, we consider the asset impaired when its carrying amount exceeds fair value less its cost to sell. Fair value is determined in the same manner as an impaired long-lived asset that is held and used.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to the fact that we no longer consolidate the expenses from our Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger, which accounted for $170.7 million, or 98% of the decrease. The remainder of the decrease was due to the impairment and retirement of rigs and rig components during the fourth quarter of 2014, which more than offset the incremental depreciation attributed to newly constructed rigs, rig upgrades and other capital expenditures made during 2014.\nOur U.S. Drilling operating segment includes land drilling activities in the lower 48 states, Alaska and offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nOperating results decreased slightly from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange variance. The Canadian dollar weakened approximately 7% against the U.S. dollar. In addition, the Canada operations were impacted by a decline in average drilling dayrates. These decreases were partially offset by streamlining activities and cost saving initiatives.\nIncome tax rate\nOther-than-temporary impairment\nManagement Overview\nInvestment income during 2015 was $2.3 million and included realized gains of $1.9 million attributable to interest and dividend income.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased slightly from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of increased activity across the operating units, particularly within our U.S. and International drilling segments. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses are comparable for each period relative to fluctuations in activity levels.\nWe are a party to some transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as \u201coff-balance sheet arrangements\u201d that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations under which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these agreements serve as guarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers' compensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve as guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our share transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees. Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote.\nSee our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods included below under \u201cOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)\u201d.\nInterest expense was relatively flat from 2014 to 2015. Our average outstanding debt balances during 2015 were lower than those in the corresponding 2014 period, primarily due to the repayment of a portion of our outstanding debt using cash consideration received in connection with the Merger. In addition, due to the downturn in the oil and gas markets, we have curtailed spending on major projects, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest recognized during the period.\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a broad-based decline in revenue-producing activities, including top drives and catwalk sales and the continued decline in financial results in our directional drilling businesses due to intense competition and the low price of oil. The decline in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in operating and general and administrative costs for this segment due to cost-reduction efforts.\nDepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment. The drilling, workover and well-servicing industries are very capital intensive. Property, plant and equipment represented 74% of our total assets as of December 31, 2015, and depreciation and amortization constituted 23% of our total costs and other deductions in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. We operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We are currently contesting tax assessments throughout the world and may contest future assessments. We believe the ultimate resolution of the outstanding assessments, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We recognize uncertain tax positions that we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any existing or future assessments.\nIn 2014, we used cash of $40.3 million to purchase 2TD. We also received $156.8 million in proceeds from sales of our oil and gas assets, other non-core operations and insurance claims.\nThe balance of the drilling rigs and rig equipment charges relate to our coil tubing drilling rig fleet in Canada and various under-utilized or under-performing rigs or asset classes throughout our International and Canada drilling fleets. We also recognized an impairment charge related to obsolete inventory within our Rig Services operating segment.\n(1) See Note 11-Debt in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n(7) Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOther expense (income), net\n(1) Includes a $51.0 million impairment charge due to the deterioration of economic conditions in the dry gas market in western Canada, partially offset by a gain related to our restructuring of our future pipeline obligations.\nA significantly prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices or changes in laws and regulations could continue to adversely affect the demand for and prices of our services, which could result in future goodwill impairment charges for other reporting units due to the potential impact on our estimate of our future operating results.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. As discussed above, the drilling, workover and well-servicing industry is very capital intensive. We review our assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying\nDuring 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $7.0 million related to an equity security. Because the trading price of this security remained below our cost basis for an extended period, we determined the investment was other than temporarily impaired and it was appropriate to write down the investment's carrying value to its current estimated fair value.\nDepreciation for our primary operating assets, drilling and workover rigs, is calculated based on the units-of-production method. For each day a rig is operating, we depreciate it over an approximate 4,927-day period, with the exception of our jackup rigs which are depreciated over an 8,030-day period, after provision for salvage value. For each day a rig asset is not operating, it is depreciated over an assumed depreciable life of 20 years, with the exception of our jackup rigs, where a 30-year depreciable life is typically used, after provision for salvage value.\nAdditionally, during 2014, we recognized an impairment of $29.9 million primarily related to various intangible assets, such as customer relationships within our Completion & Production Services and Rig Services operating segments related to previous acquisitions.\nThe carrying value of our assets held for sale represents the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We continue to market these properties at prices that are reasonable compared to current fair value.\nThe following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial guarantees issued by Nabors:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nThe demand for our services is a function of the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The primary driver of customer spending is their cash flow and earnings which are largely driven by oil and natural gas prices. The oil and natural gas markets have traditionally been volatile and tend to be highly sensitive to supply and demand cycles. During the second half of 2014, the markets experienced a dramatic decline in oil prices which remained depressed throughout 2015 and into 2016 due, at least in part, to an increase in global crude supply coupled with stagnant demand. Oil prices have declined by more than 60% from the peak oil prices of 2014, falling to approximately $35 per barrel in late 2015. Subsequent to year end, oil prices have continued to decline reaching a low of $26.21 per barrel on February 11, 2016.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs a result of the sustained reduction in the price of oil, we have experienced a decline in the demand, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in the international market, for drilling services as customers have reduced or curtailed their capital spending and drilling activities. The reduction in demand for drilling services, coupled with the increased supply of newly built high-specification rigs in the drilling market, among other factors, has led to a highly competitive market for all rigs. Accordingly, we have also experienced downward pricing pressure for our services.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2015, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share. This quarterly cash dividend was paid on December 31, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 10, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash dividends totaling $69.4 million. See Item 5.-Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity-Dividends.\nOperating revenues in 2015 totaled $3.9 billion, representing a decrease of $2.9 billion, or 43%, over 2014. The decrease in revenues was due in part to ceasing to consolidate the revenues associated with our Completion & Production Services business. Further exacerbating the decline in revenues was the decrease in activity and reduced dayrates within our U.S. and Canada Drilling operating segments resulting from the overall decline in oil prices throughout 2015 as mentioned above. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue in our International Drilling operating segment.\nDuring 2014, we sold a large portion of our interest in oil and gas proved properties located on the North Slope of Alaska. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $35.1 million at closing and expect to receive additional payments of $27.0 million upon certain future dates or the properties achieving certain production targets. In the event these production targets are not met and payments not received, our recourse would be to reclaim the properties. We retained both a working interest and an overriding royalty interest in the properties. The working interest is fully carried up to $600 million of total project costs. The $22.2 million gain from the transaction is included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The retained interest, which was valued at approximately $16.4 million as of December 31, 2015, is no longer classified as assets-held-for-sale and is included in other long-term assets. We have not recast prior period results as the balances are not material to our consolidated statements of income (loss) for any period.\n\nOur condensed statements of income (loss) from discontinued operations for each operating segment were as follows:\nAdditional discussion of our policy pertaining to the calculations of our annual impairment tests, including any impairment of goodwill, is set forth in Critical Accounting Estimates below in this section and in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Additional information relating to discontinued operations is provided in Note 4-Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A further protraction of lower commodity prices or an inability to sell these assets in a timely manner could result in recognition of future impairment charges.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOutlook\nEarnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis differences, of our equity method investments, primarily composed of our investment in CJES. We account for our investment in CJES on a one-quarter lag. Accordingly, the year ended December 31, 2015 includes our share of the net income (loss) of CJES from the closing of the Merger until September 30, 2015, resulting in a loss of $81.3 million. The operating losses of CJES for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily due to reduced activity levels driven by lower customer demand stemming from lower oil prices coupled with the further pricing concessions required by the highly competitive environment. Further sustained declines in oil prices and activity levels in the pressure pumping business could impact CJES's operations and the fair value of its assets, resulting in future operating losses.\nOur current cash and investments, projected cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility are expected to adequately finance our purchase commitments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, scheduled debt service requirements, and all other expected cash requirements for the next 12 months.\n\u00b7 changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n$500.0 million. We subsequently exercised $50.0 million of the accordion option to bring the total availability to $2.25 billion. We expect to use this capacity to provide financial flexibility for strategic investment opportunities, debt refinancing and other corporate uses. Additionally, Nabors Industries, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a new five-year unsecured term loan facility for $325.0 million. The term loan facility contains a mandatory prepayment of $162.5 million due in 2018. We used this facility to pay down our commercial paper borrowings during 2015.\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States and our historical ability to access these markets as needed. While there can be no assurances that we will be able to access these markets in the future, we believe that we will be able to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligation that might arise upon exchange or purchase of our notes and that any cash payment due, in addition to our other cash obligations, would not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations. See Part 1A.-Risk Factors-A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.\n(1) The number is so large that it is not meaningful.\nOur cash flows depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Sustained decreases in the price of oil or natural gas could have a material impact on these activities, and could also materially affect our cash flows. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures or acquisitions, purchases and sales of investments, loans, issuances and repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. We discuss our 2015 and 2014 cash flows below.\nTransaction costs\nThese depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property, plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets. Periodically, we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets. Estimation of these items requires significant management judgment. Accordingly, management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property, plant and equipment are critical.\n(11) The number is so large that it is not meaningful.\n(2) Includes a $61.5 million impairment charge to write down the carrying value of some of our wholly owned oil and gas-centered assets, partially offset by a gain related to our restructuring of our future pipeline obligations.\nOn March 24, 2015, we completed the Merger of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J Energy. In the Merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion & Production Service business was exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, CJES, and is now accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate as of the acquisition date. See further discussion in Note 9-Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Prior to the Merger, our Completion & Production Services business conducted our operations involved in the completion, life-of-well maintenance and plugging and abandonment of a well in the United States and Canada. These services include stimulation, coiled-tubing, cementing, wireline, workover, well-servicing and fluids management. As a result of the Merger, we report our share of the earnings (losses) of CJES through earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of income (loss). CJES provides well construction, well completions, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America. As we no longer consolidate the results of operations from our historical Completion & Production Services business, our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are not directly comparable to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased from 2014 to 2015. Over half of the decrease, approximately $98.5 million, was due to the fact that we no longer consolidate the expenses from our Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger. The remainder of the decrease was attributable to a reduction in workforce and general cost-reduction efforts across the remaining operating units and our corporate offices. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses are slightly higher in 2015 due to the reductions in revenues primarily across the U.S. operating units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014\nProvision for International operations\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n(6) See Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to higher demand in the United States and Canada drilling markets for top drives, rig instrumentation and data collection services from oil and gas exploration companies, along with higher third-party rental and RIGWATCH\u00ae units, which generate higher margins. These increases were partially offset by the continued decline in financial results in our directional drilling businesses due to intense competition.\n\u00b7 it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and\n\nThe change in our worldwide effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is primarily attributable to the tax effect related to impairments and internal restructuring. The change in geographic mix of pre-tax earnings also contributed to the change.\nWe own and operate the world's largest land-based drilling rig fleet and are a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. Our Drilling & Rig Services business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig services, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation, optimization software and directional drilling services. Our Drilling & Rig Services business consist of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services.\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a decline in drilling rig activity and dayrates. These declines were the direct result of lower industry activity and pricing pressure from customers resulting from the decline in oil and gas prices. The lower activity is evidenced by a 51% reduction in rig years during 2015 compared to the prior period. The Canadian dollar weakened approximately 19% against the U.S. dollar year-over-year. This also negatively impacted margins, as both revenues and expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars.\n(1) The carrying value of these assets was reduced by $51.0 million to reflect current fair value, due to the deterioration of economic conditions in the dry gas market in western Canada. The impairment charge is reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in our consolidated statement of income (loss) as outlined below.\nExcluding these items, our operating results increased in 2014 over 2013. Operating revenues in 2014 totaled $6.8 billion, representing an increase of $652.2 million, or 11%, over 2013. The increase in revenues was driven by increases from virtually all of our operating segments with the exception of Canada Drilling. Adjusted operating income for 2014 totaled $604.3 million, representing an increase of $46.1 million, or 8%, over 2013. This increase was driven primarily by our U.S. and International Drilling and Rig Services operating segments, which more than offset declines in our Completion and Production Services and Canada Drilling operating segments.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $849.9 million during 2015. In 2015, we repaid net amounts of $975.1 million under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. During 2015, we paid cash dividends of $69.4 million. Additionally, we received proceeds of $325.0 million from our term loan facility which was used to pay down our commercial paper program mentioned above.\n(5) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 4.625% senior notes due September 2021 and 5.10% senior notes due September 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the 2014 retirement and impairment charges for tangible assets and equipment by operating segment:\n(2) Includes our other services comprised of our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software services.\n(4) Adjusted EBITDA is computed by subtracting the sum of direct costs, general and administrative expenses and research and engineering expenses from operating revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of our operating segments and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because we believe that these financial measures accurately reflect our ongoing profitability and performance. In addition, securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze our performance. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided in the above table.\nDuring 2015, we retired some rigs and rig components in our U.S., Canada and International Drilling operating segments and reduced their carrying value to their estimated salvage value. Due to market conditions and resulting increase in competition in the drilling market, we have experienced a decline in utilization of our remaining legacy rigs. Accordingly, we retired roughly half of our fleet of SCR rigs within the U.S. Drilling operating segment, continuing to market the remaining 47 of our most competitive assets within this group. Additionally, we retired various yard assets within our International operating segment as well as rig-related equipment in our Canada operating segment.\nAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. There is no assurance that our insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention.\nDuring 2015, our income (loss) from continuing operations was adversely affected by approximately $369.0 million in impairments and other charges. Net loss from continuing operations totaled $329.5 million for 2015 ($1.14 per diluted share) compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $669.3 million ($2.28 per diluted share) in 2014. The impairment charges stemmed from the impact of the industry downturn on our business activity and future outlook as the continuation of depressed oil prices led to considerable reductions in capital spending by some of our customers and diminished demand for our drilling services. The impairments and retirement provisions were primarily comprised of $140.1 million related to tangible assets and equipment and $180.6 million related to an other-than-temporary impairment on our equity method investment in CJES.\n(1) All periods present the operating activities of most of our wholly owned oil and gas businesses, aircraft logistics operations and construction services as discontinued operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included under Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Part 1A.-Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes were made to the methodology used to estimate insurance reserves. For purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if the December 31, 2015 reserves were adjusted by 10%, total costs and other deductions would change by $16.6 million, or.39%.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an increase in drilling activity and dayrates in the lower 48 states. We deployed approximately 16 new PACE\u00ae-X rigs into service in 2014, bringing our total operating fleet of PACE\u00ae-X rigs to 32. The deployment of these newly built rigs was the primary factor for the increase in 2014 of rig years, operating revenues and adjusted operating income.\nOn August 25, 2015, our Board authorized a share repurchase program (the \u201cprogram\u201d) under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to $400 million of our common shares by various means, including in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This authorization does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any of our common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 10.6 million of our common shares for approximately $99.6 million under this program. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining amount authorized under the program that may be used to purchase shares was $300.4 million. The shares held by our subsidiaries are registered and tradeable subject to securities laws and have the same voting and other rights as other outstanding shares. See Note 23-Subsequent Events.\nthe amount ascertained to be unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for future utilization of our deferred assets. Any change in the ability to utilize such deferred assets will be accounted for in the period of the event affecting the valuation allowance. If facts and circumstances cause us to change our expectations regarding future tax consequences, the resulting adjustments could have a material effect on our financial results or cash flow.\nThe following table summarizes the 2015 retirement and impairment charges for tangible assets and equipment by operating segment:\nDuring 2013, we recorded a provision for retirement of long-lived assets in multiple operating segments totaling $14.0 million, which reduced the carrying value of some assets to their salvage value. The retirements related to assets in Saudi Arabia and included obsolete top-drives, nonworking trucks, generators, engines and other miscellaneous equipment. The retirements in our Canada operations included functionally inoperable rigs and other drilling equipment. In our Completion & Production Services operations, the retirements related to rigs and vehicles that would require significant repair to return to work and other non-core assets.\nIn certain jurisdictions we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. Judgment and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially utilized. When we estimate that all or some portion of certain deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized, we establish a valuation allowance for\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we determined the carrying value of our investment in CJES was other than temporarily impaired which resulted in an impairment charge of $180.6 million to reduce our carrying value to its estimated fair value determined principally based on the average share price over a specified period. The charge directly resulted from reduced activity levels driven by lower customer demand stemming from lower oil prices coupled with further pricing concessions required by the highly competitive environment. Further sustained declines in oil prices and activity levels in the pressure pumping business could impact CJES's operations and the fair value of its assets, resulting in future operating losses. Additionally, as of the date of this annual report, the market price of CJES is trading below our carrying value. Should it remain at these levels for an extended period of time, it could result in a future other-than-temporary impairment.\nThe following tables set forth certain information with respect to our reportable segments and rig activity:\nOil and Gas\nSegment Results of Operations", "item_7_text": "\n(6) Adjusted operating income (loss) is computed by subtracting the sum of direct costs, general and administrative expenses, research and engineering expenses and depreciation and amortization from operating revenues. Adjusted operating income (loss) is a non-GAAP measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of our operating segments and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because we believe that these financial measures accurately reflect our ongoing profitability and performance. In addition, securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze our performance. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided in the above table.\nTangible Assets and Equipment\nImpairment of Goodwill and Intangible Assets. We review goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually during the second quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value. We perform our impairment tests for goodwill for all of our reporting units within our operating segments. Our Drilling & Rig Services business consists of U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services operating segments. Our Rig Services operating segment includes Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd. and Ryan Directional Services, Inc. The impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, a second step is required to measure the goodwill impairment loss. This second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess.\nIn 2015, we received proceeds related to the Merger of $650.1 million. We also received $68.2 million in proceeds from sales of assets and insurance claims. Additionally, we used cash of $57.9 million (net of cash acquired) to purchase our remaining interest in Nabors Arabia.\nLitigation and Self-Insurance Reserves. Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well-servicing industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations are also subject to the hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision and other damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are subject to risks of war or acts of terrorism, civil disturbances and other political events.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased from 2013 to 2014 as a result of the incremental depreciation expense related to newly constructed rigs placed into service during 2014, and to a lesser extent, rig upgrades and other capital expenditures.\nInvestment income\nFor the year ended December 31, 2013\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $856.6 million during 2015, compared to $1.8 billion during 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities (\u201coperating cash flows\u201d) is our primary source of capital and liquidity. Factors affecting changes in operating cash flows are largely the same as those that impact net earnings, with the exception of non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization, depletion, impairments, share-based compensation, deferred income taxes and our proportionate share of earnings or losses from unconsolidated affiliates. Net income (loss) adjusted for non-cash components was approximately $871.1 million and $1.3 billion in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, changes in working capital items such as collection of receivables can be a significant component of operating cash flows. Changes in working capital items used $14.6 million and provided $487.8 million in cash flows during 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had $2.24 billion availability remaining under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, which expires July 2020. Availability under the revolving credit facility is subject to a covenant not to exceed a net debt to capital ratio of 0.60:1. As of December 31, 2015, our net debt to capital ratio was 0.44:1. See Item 6. \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d.\n\nWe had 11 letter-of-credit facilities with various banks as of December 31, 2015. Availability under these facilities as of December 31, 2015 was as follows:\nRig Services\nIn 2015, we also recorded impairments totaling $74.5 million primarily comprised of $52.5 million for an inactive jackup rig in our International operating segment. We recognized an impairment of $15.1 million to our retained interest in the oil and gas properties located on the North Slope of Alaska to reduce the carrying value to fair value, as a result of the sustained decline in oil prices. The balance of the impairment charge primarily relates to obsolete inventory within our Rig Services operating segment.\nCash Flows\nOur Drilling & Rig Services business consists of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services. For a description of this business and its operating segments, see Part I, Item 1.-Business. The following table presents our operating revenues, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income (loss) and rig years by operating segment, as applicable, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.\nImpairments of long-lived assets\nThroughout 2015, our industry continued to experience depressed oil prices, which led to considerable reductions in capital spending by some of our customers and has diminished demand for our drilling services. The impact of the industry downturn on our business activity and future outlook resulted in impairments and retirement provisions of approximately $140.1 million, an other-than-temporary impairment on our investment in CJES of $180.6 million, and the provision for International operations of $48.3 million during 2015 as discussed below.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period. We analyze our estimates based on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, actual results could differ from our estimates. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates. Management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if:\n(1) Number is so large that it is not meaningful.\nInvestment income during 2014 was $11.8 million and included $5.6 million of realized gains from short-term and other long-term investments and $6.2 million in interest and dividend income.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used for investing activities totaled $227.5 million during 2015 compared to $1.7 billion in 2014. Our primary use of cash for investing activities is for capital expenditures related to rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, as well as sustaining capital expenditures. During 2015 and 2014, we used cash for capital expenditures totaling $867.1 million and $1.8 billion, respectively.\nResearch and engineering expenses increased slightly from 2013 to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to the development of drilling and measurement tools resulting from our acquisition of NES, as well as an increase in personnel as a result of the acquisition of 2TD during October 2014.\nRig Services\n(9) International rig years include our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates, which totaled 2.5 years in 2014 and 2013. Beginning May 24, 2015, Nabors Arabia's operations have been consolidated.\nDuring 2014, our income (loss) from continuing operations was adversely affected by approximately $1.03 billion in impairments and other charges. Net loss from continuing operations totaled $669.3 million for 2014 ($2.28 per diluted share) compared to net income from continuing operations of $158.3 million ($0.51 per diluted share) in 2013.\nOperating results increased from 2014 to 2015 primarily as a result of an increase in rig count coupled with the incremental revenue associated with our acquisition of the remaining equity interest in Nabors Arabia in the second quarter of 2015. Furthermore, our International operations benefitted from the incremental margins associated with deployments of several newly constructed rigs throughout 2014. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in rig years in Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Bahrain.\n(2) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 2.35% senior notes due September 2016.\nThe change in our worldwide effective tax rate from 2014 to 2015 is primarily attributable to the tax effect of the geographic mix of pre-tax earnings (losses), including greater losses in higher-tax jurisdictions. The tax effect of impairments and internal restructuring also contributed to the change.\nResearch and engineering expenses decreased slightly from 2014 to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in workforce and general cost-reduction efforts across the various operating units.\nFuture Cash Requirements\n\nWe have contracts with pipeline companies to pay specified fees based on committed volumes for gas transport and processing associated with these properties held for sale. In December 2013, we entered into agreements to restructure these contracts, assigning a portion of the obligation to third parties and reducing our future payment commitments. At December 31, 2015, our undiscounted contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $23.3 million, and we had liabilities of $16.1 million, $5.2 million of which were classified as current and are included in accrued liabilities. At December 31, 2014, our undiscounted contractual commitments for these contracts approximated $84.6 million, and we had liabilities of $40.2 million, $19.6 million of which were classified as current and are included in accrued liabilities.\nWe may from time to time seek to retire or purchase our outstanding debt through cash purchases and/or exchanges for equity securities, both in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases or exchanges, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors and may involve material amounts.\nDue to the decline in oil prices and customers' reduced drilling activity, we have experienced a decline in our dayrates as well as the average number of rigs operating, most notably in the lower 48 states. In our U.S. Drilling operating segment, our rig years (a measure of activity and utilization) have decreased from 212.5 years during fiscal year 2014 to 120.0 years during fiscal year 2015. In our Canada Drilling operating segment, our rig years have declined by roughly 51% from 2014. Our International operating segment has not been immune from the impact of lower oil prices. Although international drilling markets tend to react slower than the North American markets, we began to experience downward pressure on dayrates in the International segment beginning in the second quarter of 2015. Our International rig years declined in the latter half of 2015, primarily due to the conclusion of several drilling projects as well as reduced activity resulting from lower commodity prices. Given the commodity price environment entering 2016, we expect continued erosion at least through the first half of the year in industry rig counts, both domestic and international, as well as continued downward pressure on the utilization and pricing of\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nDuring 2015, we entered into an amendment to our existing committed, unsecured revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing capacity to $2.2 billion, extend the maturity date to July 2020 and increase the size of the accordion option to\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe fair values calculated in these impairment tests are determined using discounted cash flow models involving assumptions based on our utilization of rigs or other oil and gas service equipment, revenues and earnings from affiliates, as well as direct costs, general and administrative costs, depreciation, applicable income taxes, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. Our discounted cash flow projections for each reporting unit were based on financial forecasts. The future cash flows were discounted to present value using discount rates that are determined to be appropriate for each reporting unit. Terminal values for each reporting unit were calculated using a Gordon Growth methodology with a long-term growth rate of 3%. We believe the fair value estimated for purposes of these tests represent a Level 3 fair value measurement.\nResearch and engineering\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2013 was $38.0 million of expense, which was primarily comprised of (i) net losses on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $13.6 million, (ii) increases to litigation reserves of $11.7 million, (iii) foreign currency exchange losses of $6.2 million and (iv) losses on debt buybacks of $3.8 million.\nWe have historically completed a number of acquisitions and will continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire assets or businesses to enhance our operations. Several of our previous acquisitions were funded through issuances of debt or our common shares. Future acquisitions may be funded using existing cash or by issuing debt or additional shares of our stock. Such capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our view of market conditions and other factors.\nThe impairments and retirement provisions stemmed from the sharp decline in crude oil prices during the fourth quarter of 2014 and the resulting impact on our customers' spending programs and demand for our services. The impairments and retirement provisions were comprised of approximately $611.6 million in charges related to drilling rigs and rig equipment and $386.5 million in impairments to our goodwill and intangible assets. The goodwill and intangible assets were primarily attributable to our Completion Services operating segment from the acquisition of Superior Well Services, Inc. (\u201cSuperior\u201d) in 2010. Of the $611.6 million in charges related to our drilling rigs and rig equipment, the majority is attributable to retirements and impairments to our lower 48 legacy rig fleet (non AC rigs), including the functional retirement of 25 mechanical rigs, an impairment to the SCR fleet and the resultant reduction in yard assets and spare rig components due to reduced operating fleet size. The balance is attributable to charges for the impairment or retirement of our jackup rig fleet in the Gulf of Mexico, our coil tubing drilling rigs in Canada and various other under-utilized rigs and related equipment in Canada and our international markets.\nDuring 2013, we recognized an impairment of $20.0 million to our fleet of coil-tubing units in our Completion & Production Services business. Intense competition and oversupply of equipment has led to lower utilization and margins for this product line. When these factors were considered as part of our annual impairment tests on long-lived assets, the sum of the estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, was less than the carrying amount of these assets. The estimated fair values of these assets were calculated using discounted cash flow models involving assumptions based on our utilization of the assets, revenues and direct costs, capital expenditures and working capital requirements. We believe the fair value estimated for purposes of these tests represents a Level 3 fair value measurement. In 2013, we suspended our coil-tubing operations in the United States.\nDuring 2014, we incurred $22.3 million in transaction costs related to the Merger with CJES, including professional fees and other costs incurred to reorganize the business in contemplation of the Merger.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDuring 2013, we recognized a loss related to the extinguishment of debt in connection with the tender offer for our 9.25% senior notes. See Note 11-Debt for additional discussion. In 2013, we completed a cash tender offer for these notes and repurchased $785.4 million aggregate principal amount. We paid the holders an aggregate of approximately $1.0 billion in cash, reflecting principal and accrued and unpaid interest and prepayment premium and recognized a loss as part of the debt extinguishment.\nApproximately two-thirds of the 2014 charges from drilling rigs and rig equipment is related to the U.S. lower 48 legacy rig fleet. Given the sharp decline in crude oil prices and the resulting impact on our customers' spending programs that we experienced in 2014, and the disproportionate impact of the reduced activity that we believe our legacy rig fleet will absorb, we have retired 25 mechanical rigs and impaired our fleet of SCR rigs, including the resultant retirement of and reduction in yard assets and spare rig components associated with a reduced overall size of our working rig fleet.\nAudit claims of approximately $180.0 million attributable to income, customs and other business taxes have been assessed against us. We have contested, or intend to contest, these assessments, including through litigation if necessary, and we believe the ultimate resolution, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. Tax authorities may issue additional assessments or pursue legal actions as a result of tax audits and we cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of such assessments and legal actions.\nThe amounts at each balance sheet date represented our best estimate of the fair value of the excess capacity of the pipeline commitments calculated using a discounted cash flow model, when considering our disposal plan, current production levels, natural gas prices and expected utilization of the pipeline over the remaining contractual term. Decreases in actual production or natural gas prices could result in future charges related to excess pipeline commitments.\n(8) We have contracts with pipeline companies to pay specified fees based on committed volumes for gas transport and processing, as calculated on a monthly basis. See Notes 4-Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations and 17-Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nThe table above excludes liabilities for uncertain tax positions totaling $32.1 million as of December 31, 2015 because we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities. Further details on the uncertain tax positions can be found in Note 12-Income Taxes in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nFinancial Results\nInterest expense\n(5) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions and unallocated corporate expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOther-than-temporary impairment\n(4) Includes a gain recognized from the sale of Peak, one of our businesses in Alaska, for which we received cash proceeds of $135.5 million\namounts may not be recoverable. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset's recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying amount of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value. The determination of future cash flows requires the estimation of dayrates and utilization, and such estimates can change based on market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. Significant and unanticipated changes to the assumptions could result in future impairments. As the determination of whether impairment charges should be recorded on our long-lived assets is subject to significant management judgment, and an impairment of these assets could result in a material charge on our consolidated statements of income (loss), management believes that accounting estimates related to impairment of long-lived assets are critical.\n\nDiscontinued Operations\nWe are a holding company and therefore rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flows from our operating subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flows to make payments of interest and principal to us. See Part I., Item 1A.-Risk Factors-As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.\nInternational\n(3) Reflects an impairment charge for a note receivable of $3.1 million remaining from the sale of one of our former Canada subsidiaries that provided logistics services.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of higher dayrates from existing land rigs in Algeria, Colombia, Northern Iraq, Russia and Saudi Arabia, as well as deployments of newly built rigs in Saudi Arabia and Argentina. These increases were partially offset by decreased land drilling activity in Mexico.\nIn light of the recent decline in crude oil prices, we have already undertaken many cost cutting initiatives in an effort to minimize the negative impact to our business. We have undertaken efforts to reduce capital expenditures, operating costs and administrative expenses. Additionally, we have strengthened our financial flexibility by streamlining operations, shedding non-core businesses and reducing net debt and interest expense. Our long-term debt obligations, as structured, have staggering maturities as well as excess capacity to help us weather the current downturn in the oil and gas market.\nAssets Held-for-Sale\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $69.8 million during 2014. In 2014, we repaid net amounts of $27.7 million under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. During 2014, we paid cash dividends of $59.1 million.\n(7) Represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis difference, of our unconsolidated affiliates accounted for by the equity method, inclusive of $(81.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 related to our share of the net loss of CJES, which we report on a one-quarter lag.\nInvestment income during 2013 was $96.6 million and included $89.0 million of realized gains from short-term and other long-term investments and net gains of $2.5 million from our trading securities. The balance was attributable to $5.1 million in interest and dividend income.\nDuring 2014, we recognized an impairment of goodwill totaling $356.6 million, the majority of which was for the remaining goodwill balance of $335.0 million in our Completion Services operating segment related to the acquisition of Superior in 2010. The value attributable to the Merger with CJES declined sharply beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, with a drop in the market price of CJES's stock and the agreed upon reduction to the amount of cash we expect to receive from this transaction. The combination of these events and a sharp decline in the market price of our stock, led us to believe that a triggering event had occurred in the fourth quarter of 2014, and we performed an impairment test on our remaining goodwill balances. We determined that our Completion Services goodwill balances should be fully impaired. The balance of the impairment relates to $21.6 million in goodwill related to Ryan Directional Services, Inc. our directional drilling operations included in our Rig Services operating segment. The decline in oil prices and the impact it had on our businesses, along with the lack of certainty surrounding an eventual recovery, led us to impair these goodwill balances.\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a decline in drilling activity in the lower 48 states, reflected by a 44% reduction in rig years during 2015 compared to the prior period. This decrease was primarily driven by lower oil prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and diminished demand as customers released rigs and delayed drilling projects in response to the significant drop in oil prices. The decline in revenue in the lower 48 states was partially offset by a decrease in operating and general and administrative costs for this segment due to cost reduction efforts.\nAssumptions made in the determination of future cash flows are made with the involvement of management personnel at the operational level where the most specific knowledge of market conditions and other operating factors exists. For 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes have been made to the methodology utilized to determine future cash flows.\nour rig fleets.\nOil and Gas Properties\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and investments, availability under our revolving credit facility, our commercial paper program and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and short-term investments of $274.6 million and working capital of $0.5 billion. As of December 31, 2014, we had cash and short-term investments of $536.2 million and working capital of $1.2 billion. At December 31, 2015, we had $2.24 billion availability remaining under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.\nApplicable income and withholding taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of our subsidiaries. We do not intend to repatriate such undistributed earnings except for distributions upon which incremental income and withholding taxes would not be material.\nTangible Assets and Equipment\nDepreciation on our buildings, well-servicing rigs, oilfield hauling and mobile equipment, marine transportation and supply vessels, aircraft equipment, and other machinery and equipment is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset after provision for salvage value (buildings-10 to 30 years; well-servicing rigs-3 to 15 years; marine transportation and supply vessels-10 to 25 years; aircraft equipment-5 to 20 years; oilfield hauling and mobile equipment and other machinery and equipment-3 to 10 years).\nDuring 2015, we recognized $25.4 million related to assets and receivables impacted by the degradation of the overall country economy and financial situation in Venezuela, which has been adversely affected by the downturn in oil prices, primarily comprised of a loss of $10.0 million related to the remeasurement of our net monetary assets denominated in local currency from the official exchange rate of 6.3 Bolivares per US dollar to the SIMADI exchange rate which was 199 Bolivares per US dollar as of September 30, 2015 and $15.4 million related to the write-off of a receivable balance. The balance of this provision represents an obligation associated with the decision to exit a non-core business line in another country within the region of $22.9 million.\nImpairments and Other Charges\nWe expect capital expenditures over the next 12 months to approximate $0.5-$0.6 billion. However, this amount could change significantly based on market conditions, our strategy and new business opportunities. Purchase commitments outstanding at December 31, 2015 totaled approximately $216.9 million, primarily for rig-related enhancements, new construction and equipment, as well as sustaining capital expenditures, other operating expenses and purchases of inventory. The level of our outstanding purchase commitments and our expected level of capital expenditures over the next 12 months reflect a number of capital programs that are currently underway or planned. These programs will result in an expansion in the number of land drilling and offshore rigs and the amount of well-servicing equipment and technology assets that we own and operate. We have the ability to reduce the planned expenditures if necessary or increase them if market conditions and new business opportunities warrant it.\n\n(3) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 6.15% senior notes due February 2018 and mandatory prepayment under the term loan facility due September 2018.\nProvision for termination of employment contract\n(3) Represents the elimination of inter-segment transactions.\nBased on the risks discussed above, it is necessary for us to estimate the level of our liability related to insurance and record reserves for these amounts in our consolidated financial statements. Reserves related to self-insurance are based on the facts and circumstances specific to the claims and our past experience with similar claims. The actual outcome of self-insured claims could differ significantly from estimated amounts. We maintain actuarially determined accruals in our consolidated balance sheets to cover self-insurance retentions for workers' compensation, employers' liability, general liability and automobile liability claims. These accruals are based on certain assumptions developed utilizing historical data to project future losses. Loss estimates in the calculation of these accruals are adjusted based upon actual claim settlements and reported claims. These loss estimates and accruals recorded in our financial statements for claims have historically been reasonable in light of the actual amount of claims paid.\n\nDuring 2013, we recognized a one-time stock grant valued at $27.0 million, which vested immediately, and $18.0 million in cash awarded and paid to Mr. Petrello in connection with the termination of his prior employment agreement. See Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies for additional discussion.\nFair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed. We have completed a number of acquisitions in recent years as discussed in Note 6-Fair Value Measurements in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. In conjunction with our accounting for these acquisitions, it was necessary for us to estimate the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the various business combinations using various assumptions. These estimates may be affected by such factors as changing market conditions, technological advances in the industry or changes in regulations governing the industry. The most significant assumptions, and the ones requiring the most judgment, involve the estimated fair values of property, plant and equipment, and the resulting amount of goodwill, if any. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management's assumptions and could result in lower estimates of values of acquired assets or of future cash flows. This could result in impairment charges being recorded in our consolidated statements of income (loss). As the determination of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is subject to significant management judgment and a change in purchase price allocations could result in a material difference in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements, management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are critical.\n(5) Number is so large that it is not meaningful.\n\nFinancial Condition and Sources of Liquidity\n\nThere have been no factors related to the performance of our portfolio of assets, changes in technology or other factors indicating that these estimates do not continue to be appropriate. Accordingly, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes have been made to the depreciation rates applied to property, plant and equipment, the underlying assumptions related to estimates of depreciation, or the methodology applied. However, certain events could occur that would materially affect our estimates and assumptions related to depreciation. Unforeseen changes in operations or technology could substantially alter management's assumptions regarding our ability to realize the return on our investment in operating assets and therefore affect the useful lives and salvage values of our assets.\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2015 was $39.2 million of income, which was primarily comprised of a net gain of $47.1 million related to the Merger, inclusive of a $102.2 million gross gain offset by transaction costs and post-closing adjustment, and net gains on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $2.3 million. These gains were partially offset by increases to litigation reserves of $8.2 million and foreign currency exchange losses of $0.4 million.\nOur interest coverage ratio was 6.2:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 9.8:1 as of December 31, 2014. The interest coverage ratio is a trailing 12-month quotient of the sum of (x) operating revenues, direct costs, general administrative expenses and research and engineering expenses divided by (y) interest expense. The interest coverage ratio is not a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\nBecause the determination of our liability for self-insured claims is subject to significant management judgment and in certain instances is based on actuarially estimated and calculated amounts, and because such liabilities could be material in nature, management believes that accounting estimates related to self-insurance reserves are critical.\nU.S.\n\nEarnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates\nProvision for retirement of long-lived assets\nFor a summary of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nOur gross debt to capital ratio was 0.46:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 0.47:1 as of December 31, 2014, respectively. Our net debt to capital ratio was 0.44:1 as of December 31, 2015 and 0.43:1 as of December 31, 2014. The gross debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing (x) total debt by (y) total capital. Total capital is defined as total debt plus shareholders' equity. Net debt is total debt minus the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Neither the gross debt to capital ratio nor the net debt to capital ratio is a measure of operating performance or liquidity defined by GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.\n\nThe determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities is based on the market for the assets and the settlement value of the liabilities. These estimates are made by management based on our experience with similar assets and liabilities. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes were made to the methodology utilized to value assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Our estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed have proved to be reliable in the past.\n(10) Rig hours represents the number of hours that our well-servicing rig fleet operated during the year. This fleet was included in the Completion & Production Services business that was merged with C&J Energy in March 2015 and we will therefore no longer report this performance metric.\nAlso included in the 2014 charges for our U.S. drilling rigs and rig equipment is a retirement provision of approximately $54.4 million for our Gulf of Mexico jackup fleet. This market has been challenged for the past several years and we believe the drop in oil prices will exacerbate the lack of demand for these rigs. The majority of these rigs would require substantial amounts of capital in order for them to be operable again.\n(8) Excludes well-servicing rigs, which are measured in rig hours. Includes our equivalent percentage ownership of rigs owned by unconsolidated affiliates. Rig years represent a measure of the number of equivalent rigs operating during a given period. For example, one rig operating 182.5 days during a 365-day period represents 0.5 rig years.\nInterest expense decreased from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of the redemptions of $785.4 million of our 9.25% senior notes in September 2013. During 2014, our average outstanding debt balances were similar to the levels of debt outstanding during 2013. However, our average interest rates were lower on those outstanding balances, primarily due to replacing the high coupon 9.25% senior notes in September 2013, with the issuance of $700 million aggregate principal senior notes at lower coupon rates, comprised of $350.0 million principal amount of 2.35% senior notes and $350.0 million principal amount of 5.10% senior notes. Additionally, we expanded the use of our low cost commercial paper program during 2014, resulting in a favorable mix between balances outstanding on the revolving line of credit and commercial paper.\nLoss on tendered notes\nThe amount of other expense (income), net for 2014 was $9.1 million of expense, which was primarily comprised of (i) increases to litigation reserves of $8.9 million, (ii) losses on debt buybacks of $5.6 million and (iii) foreign currency exchange losses of $1.0 million. These losses were partially offset by the net gain on sales and disposals of assets of approximately $8.8 million.\nCanada\n(4) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 9.25% senior notes due January 2019, amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility and issued under our commercial paper program, which expires July 2020, 5.0% senior notes due September 2020 and borrowings outstanding under the term loan facility due September 2020.\nDrilling & Rig Services\nFor an asset classified as held for sale, we consider the asset impaired when its carrying amount exceeds fair value less its cost to sell. Fair value is determined in the same manner as an impaired long-lived asset that is held and used.\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to the fact that we no longer consolidate the expenses from our Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger, which accounted for $170.7 million, or 98% of the decrease. The remainder of the decrease was due to the impairment and retirement of rigs and rig components during the fourth quarter of 2014, which more than offset the incremental depreciation attributed to newly constructed rigs, rig upgrades and other capital expenditures made during 2014.\nOur U.S. Drilling operating segment includes land drilling activities in the lower 48 states, Alaska and offshore operations in the Gulf of Mexico.\nOperating results decreased slightly from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an unfavorable foreign exchange variance. The Canadian dollar weakened approximately 7% against the U.S. dollar. In addition, the Canada operations were impacted by a decline in average drilling dayrates. These decreases were partially offset by streamlining activities and cost saving initiatives.\nIncome tax rate\nOther-than-temporary impairment\nManagement Overview\nInvestment income during 2015 was $2.3 million and included realized gains of $1.9 million attributable to interest and dividend income.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased slightly from 2013 to 2014 primarily as a result of increased activity across the operating units, particularly within our U.S. and International drilling segments. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses are comparable for each period relative to fluctuations in activity levels.\nWe are a party to some transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements defined as \u201coff-balance sheet arrangements\u201d that could have a material future effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity and capital resources. The most significant of these off-balance sheet arrangements involve agreements and obligations under which we provide financial or performance assurance to third parties. Certain of these agreements serve as guarantees, including standby letters of credit issued on behalf of insurance carriers in conjunction with our workers' compensation insurance program and other financial surety instruments such as bonds. In addition, we have provided indemnifications, which serve as guarantees, to some third parties. These guarantees include indemnification provided by Nabors to our share transfer agent and our insurance carriers. We are not able to estimate the potential future maximum payments that might be due under our indemnification guarantees. Management believes the likelihood that we would be required to perform or otherwise incur any material losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote.\nSee our discussion of guarantees issued by Nabors that could have a potential impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows in future periods included below under \u201cOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements (Including Guarantees)\u201d.\nInterest expense was relatively flat from 2014 to 2015. Our average outstanding debt balances during 2015 were lower than those in the corresponding 2014 period, primarily due to the repayment of a portion of our outstanding debt using cash consideration received in connection with the Merger. In addition, due to the downturn in the oil and gas markets, we have curtailed spending on major projects, which resulted in a reduction in the amount of capitalized interest recognized during the period.\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a broad-based decline in revenue-producing activities, including top drives and catwalk sales and the continued decline in financial results in our directional drilling businesses due to intense competition and the low price of oil. The decline in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in operating and general and administrative costs for this segment due to cost-reduction efforts.\nDepreciation of Property, Plant and Equipment. The drilling, workover and well-servicing industries are very capital intensive. Property, plant and equipment represented 74% of our total assets as of December 31, 2015, and depreciation and amortization constituted 23% of our total costs and other deductions in 2015.\nIncome Taxes. We operate in a number of countries throughout the world and our tax returns filed in those jurisdictions are subject to review and examination by tax authorities within those jurisdictions. We are currently contesting tax assessments throughout the world and may contest future assessments. We believe the ultimate resolution of the outstanding assessments, for which we have not made any accrual, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. We recognize uncertain tax positions that we believe have a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being sustained. We cannot predict or provide assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any existing or future assessments.\nIn 2014, we used cash of $40.3 million to purchase 2TD. We also received $156.8 million in proceeds from sales of our oil and gas assets, other non-core operations and insurance claims.\nThe balance of the drilling rigs and rig equipment charges relate to our coil tubing drilling rig fleet in Canada and various under-utilized or under-performing rigs or asset classes throughout our International and Canada drilling fleets. We also recognized an impairment charge related to obsolete inventory within our Rig Services operating segment.\n(1) See Note 11-Debt in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n(7) Purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable pricing provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.\nOther expense (income), net\n(1) Includes a $51.0 million impairment charge due to the deterioration of economic conditions in the dry gas market in western Canada, partially offset by a gain related to our restructuring of our future pipeline obligations.\nA significantly prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices or changes in laws and regulations could continue to adversely affect the demand for and prices of our services, which could result in future goodwill impairment charges for other reporting units due to the potential impact on our estimate of our future operating results.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets. As discussed above, the drilling, workover and well-servicing industry is very capital intensive. We review our assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying\nDuring 2014, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of $7.0 million related to an equity security. Because the trading price of this security remained below our cost basis for an extended period, we determined the investment was other than temporarily impaired and it was appropriate to write down the investment's carrying value to its current estimated fair value.\nDepreciation for our primary operating assets, drilling and workover rigs, is calculated based on the units-of-production method. For each day a rig is operating, we depreciate it over an approximate 4,927-day period, with the exception of our jackup rigs which are depreciated over an 8,030-day period, after provision for salvage value. For each day a rig asset is not operating, it is depreciated over an assumed depreciable life of 20 years, with the exception of our jackup rigs, where a 30-year depreciable life is typically used, after provision for salvage value.\nAdditionally, during 2014, we recognized an impairment of $29.9 million primarily related to various intangible assets, such as customer relationships within our Completion & Production Services and Rig Services operating segments related to previous acquisitions.\nThe carrying value of our assets held for sale represents the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. We continue to market these properties at prices that are reasonable compared to current fair value.\nThe following table summarizes the total maximum amount of financial guarantees issued by Nabors:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015\n\nThe demand for our services is a function of the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. The primary driver of customer spending is their cash flow and earnings which are largely driven by oil and natural gas prices. The oil and natural gas markets have traditionally been volatile and tend to be highly sensitive to supply and demand cycles. During the second half of 2014, the markets experienced a dramatic decline in oil prices which remained depressed throughout 2015 and into 2016 due, at least in part, to an increase in global crude supply coupled with stagnant demand. Oil prices have declined by more than 60% from the peak oil prices of 2014, falling to approximately $35 per barrel in late 2015. Subsequent to year end, oil prices have continued to decline reaching a low of $26.21 per barrel on February 11, 2016.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nAs a result of the sustained reduction in the price of oil, we have experienced a decline in the demand, primarily in North America and to a lesser extent in the international market, for drilling services as customers have reduced or curtailed their capital spending and drilling activities. The reduction in demand for drilling services, coupled with the increased supply of newly built high-specification rigs in the drilling market, among other factors, has led to a highly competitive market for all rigs. Accordingly, we have also experienced downward pricing pressure for our services.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2015, our Board declared a cash dividend of $0.06 per common share. This quarterly cash dividend was paid on December 31, 2015 to shareholders of record on December 10, 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash dividends totaling $69.4 million. See Item 5.-Market Price of and Dividends on the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity-Dividends.\nOperating revenues in 2015 totaled $3.9 billion, representing a decrease of $2.9 billion, or 43%, over 2014. The decrease in revenues was due in part to ceasing to consolidate the revenues associated with our Completion & Production Services business. Further exacerbating the decline in revenues was the decrease in activity and reduced dayrates within our U.S. and Canada Drilling operating segments resulting from the overall decline in oil prices throughout 2015 as mentioned above. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in revenue in our International Drilling operating segment.\nDuring 2014, we sold a large portion of our interest in oil and gas proved properties located on the North Slope of Alaska. Under the terms of the agreement, we received $35.1 million at closing and expect to receive additional payments of $27.0 million upon certain future dates or the properties achieving certain production targets. In the event these production targets are not met and payments not received, our recourse would be to reclaim the properties. We retained both a working interest and an overriding royalty interest in the properties. The working interest is fully carried up to $600 million of total project costs. The $22.2 million gain from the transaction is included in other expense (income), net in our consolidated statements of income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2014. The retained interest, which was valued at approximately $16.4 million as of December 31, 2015, is no longer classified as assets-held-for-sale and is included in other long-term assets. We have not recast prior period results as the balances are not material to our consolidated statements of income (loss) for any period.\n\nOur condensed statements of income (loss) from discontinued operations for each operating segment were as follows:\nAdditional discussion of our policy pertaining to the calculations of our annual impairment tests, including any impairment of goodwill, is set forth in Critical Accounting Estimates below in this section and in Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Additional information relating to discontinued operations is provided in Note 4-Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A further protraction of lower commodity prices or an inability to sell these assets in a timely manner could result in recognition of future impairment charges.\nDepreciation and amortization\nOutlook\nEarnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates represents our share of the net income (loss), as adjusted for our basis differences, of our equity method investments, primarily composed of our investment in CJES. We account for our investment in CJES on a one-quarter lag. Accordingly, the year ended December 31, 2015 includes our share of the net income (loss) of CJES from the closing of the Merger until September 30, 2015, resulting in a loss of $81.3 million. The operating losses of CJES for the nine months ended September 30, 2015 are primarily due to reduced activity levels driven by lower customer demand stemming from lower oil prices coupled with the further pricing concessions required by the highly competitive environment. Further sustained declines in oil prices and activity levels in the pressure pumping business could impact CJES's operations and the fair value of its assets, resulting in future operating losses.\nOur current cash and investments, projected cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility are expected to adequately finance our purchase commitments, capital expenditures, acquisitions, scheduled debt service requirements, and all other expected cash requirements for the next 12 months.\n\u00b7 changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\n$500.0 million. We subsequently exercised $50.0 million of the accordion option to bring the total availability to $2.25 billion. We expect to use this capacity to provide financial flexibility for strategic investment opportunities, debt refinancing and other corporate uses. Additionally, Nabors Industries, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a new five-year unsecured term loan facility for $325.0 million. The term loan facility contains a mandatory prepayment of $162.5 million due in 2018. We used this facility to pay down our commercial paper borrowings during 2015.\nOur ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States and our historical ability to access these markets as needed. While there can be no assurances that we will be able to access these markets in the future, we believe that we will be able to access capital markets or otherwise obtain financing in order to satisfy any payment obligation that might arise upon exchange or purchase of our notes and that any cash payment due, in addition to our other cash obligations, would not ultimately have a material adverse impact on our liquidity or financial position. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations. See Part 1A.-Risk Factors-A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.\n(1) The number is so large that it is not meaningful.\nOur cash flows depend, to a large degree, on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Sustained decreases in the price of oil or natural gas could have a material impact on these activities, and could also materially affect our cash flows. Certain sources and uses of cash, such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures or acquisitions, purchases and sales of investments, loans, issuances and repurchases of debt and of our common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based on market conditions. We discuss our 2015 and 2014 cash flows below.\nTransaction costs\nThese depreciation periods and the salvage values of our property, plant and equipment were determined through an analysis of the useful lives of our assets and based on our experience with the salvage values of these assets. Periodically, we review our depreciation periods and salvage values for reasonableness given current conditions. Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is therefore based upon estimates of the useful lives and salvage value of those assets. Estimation of these items requires significant management judgment. Accordingly, management believes that accounting estimates related to depreciation expense recorded on property, plant and equipment are critical.\n(11) The number is so large that it is not meaningful.\n(2) Includes a $61.5 million impairment charge to write down the carrying value of some of our wholly owned oil and gas-centered assets, partially offset by a gain related to our restructuring of our future pipeline obligations.\nOn March 24, 2015, we completed the Merger of our Completion & Production Services business with C&J Energy. In the Merger and related transactions, our wholly-owned interest in our Completion & Production Service business was exchanged for cash and an equity interest in the combined entity, CJES, and is now accounted for as an unconsolidated affiliate as of the acquisition date. See further discussion in Note 9-Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates. Prior to the Merger, our Completion & Production Services business conducted our operations involved in the completion, life-of-well maintenance and plugging and abandonment of a well in the United States and Canada. These services include stimulation, coiled-tubing, cementing, wireline, workover, well-servicing and fluids management. As a result of the Merger, we report our share of the earnings (losses) of CJES through earnings (losses) from unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated statements of income (loss). CJES provides well construction, well completions, well support and other complementary oilfield services to oil and gas exploration and production companies primarily in North America. As we no longer consolidate the results of operations from our historical Completion & Production Services business, our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 are not directly comparable to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased from 2014 to 2015. Over half of the decrease, approximately $98.5 million, was due to the fact that we no longer consolidate the expenses from our Completion & Production Services business as a result of the Merger. The remainder of the decrease was attributable to a reduction in workforce and general cost-reduction efforts across the remaining operating units and our corporate offices. As a percentage of operating revenues, general and administrative expenses are slightly higher in 2015 due to the reductions in revenues primarily across the U.S. operating units.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014\nProvision for International operations\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n(6) See Note 17-Commitments and Contingencies in Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to higher demand in the United States and Canada drilling markets for top drives, rig instrumentation and data collection services from oil and gas exploration companies, along with higher third-party rental and RIGWATCH\u00ae units, which generate higher margins. These increases were partially offset by the continued decline in financial results in our directional drilling businesses due to intense competition.\n\u00b7 it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made; and\n\nThe change in our worldwide effective tax rate from 2013 to 2014 is primarily attributable to the tax effect related to impairments and internal restructuring. The change in geographic mix of pre-tax earnings also contributed to the change.\nWe own and operate the world's largest land-based drilling rig fleet and are a leading provider of offshore platform workover and drilling rigs in the United States and multiple international markets. Our Drilling & Rig Services business is comprised of our global land-based and offshore drilling rig operations and other rig services, consisting of equipment manufacturing, rig instrumentation, optimization software and directional drilling services. Our Drilling & Rig Services business consist of four reportable operating segments: U.S., Canada, International and Rig Services.\nOperating results decreased from 2014 to 2015 primarily due to a decline in drilling rig activity and dayrates. These declines were the direct result of lower industry activity and pricing pressure from customers resulting from the decline in oil and gas prices. The lower activity is evidenced by a 51% reduction in rig years during 2015 compared to the prior period. The Canadian dollar weakened approximately 19% against the U.S. dollar year-over-year. This also negatively impacted margins, as both revenues and expenses are denominated in Canadian dollars.\n(1) The carrying value of these assets was reduced by $51.0 million to reflect current fair value, due to the deterioration of economic conditions in the dry gas market in western Canada. The impairment charge is reflected in income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax in our consolidated statement of income (loss) as outlined below.\nExcluding these items, our operating results increased in 2014 over 2013. Operating revenues in 2014 totaled $6.8 billion, representing an increase of $652.2 million, or 11%, over 2013. The increase in revenues was driven by increases from virtually all of our operating segments with the exception of Canada Drilling. Adjusted operating income for 2014 totaled $604.3 million, representing an increase of $46.1 million, or 8%, over 2013. This increase was driven primarily by our U.S. and International Drilling and Rig Services operating segments, which more than offset declines in our Completion and Production Services and Canada Drilling operating segments.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash used for financing activities totaled $849.9 million during 2015. In 2015, we repaid net amounts of $975.1 million under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. During 2015, we paid cash dividends of $69.4 million. Additionally, we received proceeds of $325.0 million from our term loan facility which was used to pay down our commercial paper program mentioned above.\n(5) Represents Nabors Delaware's aggregate 4.625% senior notes due September 2021 and 5.10% senior notes due September 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the 2014 retirement and impairment charges for tangible assets and equipment by operating segment:\n(2) Includes our other services comprised of our drilling technology and top drive manufacturing, directional drilling, rig instrumentation and software services.\n(4) Adjusted EBITDA is computed by subtracting the sum of direct costs, general and administrative expenses and research and engineering expenses from operating revenues. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and should not be used in isolation or as a substitute for the amounts reported in accordance with GAAP. However, management evaluates the performance of our operating segments and the consolidated company based on several criteria, including adjusted EBITDA and adjusted operating income (loss), because we believe that these financial measures accurately reflect our ongoing profitability and performance. In addition, securities analysts and investors use this measure as one of the metrics on which they analyze our performance. A reconciliation of this non-GAAP measure to income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes, which is a GAAP measure, is provided in the above table.\nDuring 2015, we retired some rigs and rig components in our U.S., Canada and International Drilling operating segments and reduced their carrying value to their estimated salvage value. Due to market conditions and resulting increase in competition in the drilling market, we have experienced a decline in utilization of our remaining legacy rigs. Accordingly, we retired roughly half of our fleet of SCR rigs within the U.S. Drilling operating segment, continuing to market the remaining 47 of our most competitive assets within this group. Additionally, we retired various yard assets within our International operating segment as well as rig-related equipment in our Canada operating segment.\nAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. There is no assurance that our insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention.\nDuring 2015, our income (loss) from continuing operations was adversely affected by approximately $369.0 million in impairments and other charges. Net loss from continuing operations totaled $329.5 million for 2015 ($1.14 per diluted share) compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $669.3 million ($2.28 per diluted share) in 2014. The impairment charges stemmed from the impact of the industry downturn on our business activity and future outlook as the continuation of depressed oil prices led to considerable reductions in capital spending by some of our customers and diminished demand for our drilling services. The impairments and retirement provisions were primarily comprised of $140.1 million related to tangible assets and equipment and $180.6 million related to an other-than-temporary impairment on our equity method investment in CJES.\n(1) All periods present the operating activities of most of our wholly owned oil and gas businesses, aircraft logistics operations and construction services as discontinued operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included under Part II, Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Part 1A.-Risk Factors and elsewhere in this annual report. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nDuring 2015, 2014 and 2013, no significant changes were made to the methodology used to estimate insurance reserves. For purposes of earnings sensitivity analysis, if the December 31, 2015 reserves were adjusted by 10%, total costs and other deductions would change by $16.6 million, or.39%.\nOperating results increased from 2013 to 2014 primarily due to an increase in drilling activity and dayrates in the lower 48 states. We deployed approximately 16 new PACE\u00ae-X rigs into service in 2014, bringing our total operating fleet of PACE\u00ae-X rigs to 32. The deployment of these newly built rigs was the primary factor for the increase in 2014 of rig years, operating revenues and adjusted operating income.\nOn August 25, 2015, our Board authorized a share repurchase program (the \u201cprogram\u201d) under which we may repurchase, from time to time, up to $400 million of our common shares by various means, including in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. This authorization does not have an expiration date and does not obligate us to repurchase any of our common shares. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we repurchased 10.6 million of our common shares for approximately $99.6 million under this program. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining amount authorized under the program that may be used to purchase shares was $300.4 million. The shares held by our subsidiaries are registered and tradeable subject to securities laws and have the same voting and other rights as other outstanding shares. See Note 23-Subsequent Events.\nthe amount ascertained to be unrealizable. We continually evaluate strategies that could allow for future utilization of our deferred assets. Any change in the ability to utilize such deferred assets will be accounted for in the period of the event affecting the valuation allowance. If facts and circumstances cause us to change our expectations regarding future tax consequences, the resulting adjustments could have a material effect on our financial results or cash flow.\nThe following table summarizes the 2015 retirement and impairment charges for tangible assets and equipment by operating segment:\nDuring 2013, we recorded a provision for retirement of long-lived assets in multiple operating segments totaling $14.0 million, which reduced the carrying value of some assets to their salvage value. The retirements related to assets in Saudi Arabia and included obsolete top-drives, nonworking trucks, generators, engines and other miscellaneous equipment. The retirements in our Canada operations included functionally inoperable rigs and other drilling equipment. In our Completion & Production Services operations, the retirements related to rigs and vehicles that would require significant repair to return to work and other non-core assets.\nIn certain jurisdictions we have recognized deferred tax assets and liabilities. Judgment and assumptions are required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be fully or partially utilized. When we estimate that all or some portion of certain deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized, we establish a valuation allowance for\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, we determined the carrying value of our investment in CJES was other than temporarily impaired which resulted in an impairment charge of $180.6 million to reduce our carrying value to its estimated fair value determined principally based on the average share price over a specified period. The charge directly resulted from reduced activity levels driven by lower customer demand stemming from lower oil prices coupled with further pricing concessions required by the highly competitive environment. Further sustained declines in oil prices and activity levels in the pressure pumping business could impact CJES's operations and the fair value of its assets, resulting in future operating losses. Additionally, as of the date of this annual report, the market price of CJES is trading below our carrying value. Should it remain at these levels for an extended period of time, it could result in a future other-than-temporary impairment.\nThe following tables set forth certain information with respect to our

Some key points:\n\n- Nabors provides drilling, rig, and well-servicing equipment and services for oil and gas exploration. Its business segments include U.S., Canada, International, and Rig Services drilling, as well as Completion & Production services. \n\n- Revenue decreased 43% in 2015 vs 2014, from $6.8 billion to $3.9 billion, mainly due to the merger of the Completion & Production Services segment and declines in drilling activity and rates in U.S. and Canada due to lower oil prices.\n\n- Net loss from continuing operations was $329.5 million in 2015 compared to a loss of $669.3 million in 2014. 2015 impairments and charges totaled $369 million while 2014 had $1.03 billion.\n\n- Impairments in 2015 stemmed from industry downturn and reduced demand, including $140 million for tangible assets and $181 million for investment impairment. 2014 impairments were mainly for goodwill, intangibles, and drilling rigs.\n\n- Depreciation, interest, tax rates, and expenses decreased due to the merger, asset impairments, cost reductions, and lower activity. \n\n- Cash flow from operations declined due to lower earnings. Capital expenditures also declined. Debt was paid down using cash from the merger. \n\n- Outlook for 2016 is lower activity and prices in North America. International markets reacting slower but seeing reductions too. Continued impairments possible if prices stay low."}
