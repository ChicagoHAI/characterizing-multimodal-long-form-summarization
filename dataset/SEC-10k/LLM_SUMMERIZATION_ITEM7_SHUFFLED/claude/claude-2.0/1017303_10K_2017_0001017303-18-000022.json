Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.\nForward Looking Statements\nCertain statements included in this report, including without limitation statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (the \"Exchange Act\")Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"project\" or \"continue\" or the negative thereof or other similar words. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those listed in Item 1A of this Annual Report and such other risk and uncertainties as are described in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time.. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and we assume no duty to update them.\nOverview\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued to focus our efforts on sales execution and growing the revenue of our newer, value-added products and technologies. During the year we completed the build-out of our direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market. We expect the investments we have made during 2017 to result in increased sales in restaurant solutions as we begin to see significant sales contribution from our two newest products, the AccuDate Pro and AccuDate XL.\nDuring 2018, we plan to strategically invest in our sales and marketing for our European casino and gaming market. Effective December 31, 2017, we terminated the relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor and began building an internal sales team to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. As a result of this investment we expect international casino and gaming sales will increase in 2018 compared to 2017. During 2017, sales for our POS automation and banking market decreased as sales to McDonald's began to slow during 2017 compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales of our POS automation and banking market to decrease in 2018 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives which began in 2015 and we shift of our focus toward the restaurant solutions market and casino and gaming market. These decreases were partially offset by increased TSG sales due to higher sales of spare parts in the lottery market in 2017 to IGT compared to 2016.\nDuring 2017, our total net sales decreased 2% to approximately $56,311,000. See the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> POS automation and banking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,613\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (24.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Casino and gaming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,391\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lottery\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,913\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Printrex\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,052\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TSG\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,096\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,311\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (924\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales of our restaurant solutions products decreased 8% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the restaurant solutions market, our focus lies with providing terminals that print food rotational date and nutritional labels to help restaurants and other food service establishments effectively manage food rotation and safety. The decrease in restaurant solutions sales resulted from lower sales of our AccuDate\u2122 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal and the initial sales of our AccuDate XL terminal in 2017. Our focus for 2018 will be to capitalize on the 2017 investments made in creating our direct selling model and in our latest terminal, the AccuDate XL.\nSales of our POS automation and banking products decreased 25% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the POS market, we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless labels for customers in the restaurant and quick serve markets. During 2017, sales of our POS automation and banking printers declined as sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales to continue to decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives that use the Ithaca\u00ae 9000 which began in 2015. POS automation and banking sales also decreased in 2017 due to a 37% decline in sales of our other legacy POS and banking printers. In the banking market, we focus mainly on supplying printers for use in bank teller stations at banks and financial institutions primarily in the U.S. Although we continue to provide printers to our existing banking and POS (non-McDonald's) customers, we have significantly reduced our focus on this market in order to increase our focus on the restaurant solutions market.\nSales of our casino and gaming products decreased 11% in 2017 compared to 2016. In our casino and gaming market, our focus lies primarily in supplying printers worldwide for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks, as well as in other electronic gaming devices that print tickets or receipts. Additionally, we supplement these printer sales with revenue from EPICENTRAL\u2122, our promotional printing system that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and print them real time at the slot machine. The decrease of casino and gaming printer sales is primarily due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers and 46% decrease in international sales of the EPIC 950, our thermal casino printer, due to continued sluggishness in Europe, Australia and Asia, including significantly lower sales to our former exclusive worldwide distributor. Effective December 31, 2017, we terminated the relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor and have begun to develop an internal sales team to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. Domestic casino and gaming printer sales increased 22% due mainly to higher sales to our OEMs to support new casino openings and market share gains. Sales of our EPICENTRALTM software decreased 42% as we completed two installations worldwide in 2017 compared to three installations in 2016.\nIn the lottery market, we continue to hold a leading position based on our long-term relationship with IGT, our largest customer and the world's largest provider of lottery terminals. IGT has been our customer since 1995, and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them. During 2017, total lottery printer sales to IGT remained relatively consistent with 2016. A decrease of 11% in domestic lottery sales to IGT was almost entirely offset by a $1 million increase in international lottery sales to IGT due to a sale in 2017 for the Canadian lottery and no comparable sales in 2016. Our sales to IGT each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. Starting in 2015, we no longer have an exclusive arrangement with IGT. However, we continue to have a good relationship with IGT which we expect to continue, and we also have the ability to sell our market leading products to other lottery system customers.\nSales of our Printrex branded printers include wide format, rack mounted and vehicle mounted thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. Sales in this market also includes wide format vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. During 2017, we experienced 95% increase in Printrex product sales due primarily to the recovery of the worldwide oil and gas market that had been negatively impacted from multiple years of declining worldwide oil prices. Although we expect to see continued modest growth in the oil and gas markets during 2018, we do not anticipate significant contribution to total sales from our Printrex products as we shift our focus towards our higher value, technology enabled restaurant solution terminals and casino and gaming products.\nOur TSG group, which sells service, replacement parts and consumable products, including food safety labels, receipt paper, ribbons and inkjet cartridges, continues to offer a recurring revenue stream for the Company. TSG sales increased 40% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to unusually high sales of replacement parts to IGT for a legacy lottery printer in 2017 that did not occur at the same level in 2016. Although the installed base of our thermal lottery printers continues to grow and lotteries continue to extend lottery contracts utilizing our existing hardware, including our printer, based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments from IGT for spare parts, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2018 due to the higher than normal IGT spare parts sales in 2017.\nOperationally, our gross margin reached 47.3% in 2017, an increase of 570 basis points from 2016, representing the highest gross margin we have reported for a full year. We believe gross margin will continue at these levels in 2018 as our newer, technology-enabled products continue to grow and become a larger portion of our overall sales. In 2017, we achieved operating margin of 12.1% compared to 9.1% in 2016 due to our improved gross margin that was partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily to support our two high growth markets--restaurant solutions and casino and gaming. During 2018, we expect higher operating expenses compared to 2017, as we continue to increase our investments in selling and marketing in these two high growth markets, as we believe these represent TransAct's most significant, long term growth opportunity.\nWe reported net income of $3,211,000 and net income per diluted share of $0.42 for 2017, compared to $3,617,000 and net income per diluted share of $0.47 for 2016. In terms of cash flow for 2017, we experienced a very strong year, generating $5,918,000 of cash from operating activities. We also returned $2,939,000 to our shareholders in the form of $358,000 for treasury share repurchases and $2,581,000 for cash dividends and finishing the year with cash and cash equivalents of $5,507,000 and no debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both Balance Sheet items and Statement of Income categories. Such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances. We evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates. Actual results may differ from the original estimates.\nThe following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are therefore based on our judgment. Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition - Our typical contracts include the sale of printers and terminals, which are sometimes accompanied by separately-priced extended warranty and technical support contracts. We also sell replacement parts, consumables, and other repair services (sometimes pursuant to multi-year product maintenance contracts), which are not included in the original printer or terminal sale and are ordered by the customer as needed. We recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605, \"Revenue Recognition\" (ASC 605). Specifically, revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery (based on shipping terms which are generally FOB shipping point) has occurred, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from the sale of printers and terminals to our distributors and resellers on a sell-in basis and on substantially the same terms as we recognize revenue from all our other customers. We provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition.\nOur software solution, EPICENTRALTM, enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. Revenue arrangements for EPICENTRALTM include multiple deliverables and as a result such arrangements are accounted for in accordance with both ASC 605-25, \"Multiple-Element Arrangements\" and ASC 985-605, \"Software.\" EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component. EPICENTRAL\u2122 contains both software and hardware that are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality. These arrangements are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605-25, \"Multiple-Element Arrangements\". EPICENTRAL\u2122 can also include an additional software offering, Mobile Host, that allows the customer to access certain applications on mobile devices. Mobile Host is accounted for in accordance with ASC 985-605, \"Software\" as Mobile Host software does not function together with the hardware device to deliver its essential functionality.\nRevenue, inclusive of software license fees, is generally recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer with the exception of any amount allocated to free maintenance which is deferred and recognized over the initial maintenance period, generally one year.\nFor EPICENTRALTM and other multiple deliverable arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables in an arrangement are within the scope of existing higher-level generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and apply such literature to the extent that it provides guidance regarding whether to separate multiple-deliverable arrangements and how to allocate value among those separate units of accounting. When we enter into a multiple deliverable arrangement, we also determine whether revenue arrangements consist of more than one unit of accounting. At that time, we allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy, except where amounts allocable to the delivered units is limited to that which is contingent upon the delivery of additional deliverables or meeting other specified performance conditions. The relative selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") if available, third party evidence (\"TPE\") if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\") to the extent that VSOE or TPE are not available.\nRevenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to ASC 605-20-25, \"Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts.\" Pursuant to this guidance, revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period. We record deferred revenue for advance payments received from customers for maintenance contracts.\nOur customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery. We monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience. Returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns.\nWe offer some of our customers price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product. These price protection plans provide that if we lower prices, we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold. Our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory, and we infrequently lower prices on current products. As a result, the amounts paid under these plans have not been material. However, we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue.\nWe charge our customers for shipping and handling services. The amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships. Any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales.\nAccounts Receivable - We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including: credit reviews of all new customer accounts; ongoing credit evaluations of current customers; credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information; and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness. We also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $100,000, or less than 1% of outstanding accounts receivable, which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.\nInventories - Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. We review net realizable value based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion, disposal and transportation, historical usage and estimates of future demand. Assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made, as necessary, to reflect changing market conditions. Based on these reviews, inventory write-downs are recorded, as necessary, to reflect estimated obsolescence, excess quantities and net realizable value. Should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence, additional write-downs of inventory could result in a charge to income.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - We acquire businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with ASC 350-20 \"Goodwill\", acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change, that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. We reported $2,621,000 of goodwill and $458,000 of unamortized definite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2017. We have determined that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment has occurred and the fair value of goodwill was substantially higher than our carrying value based on our assessment as of December 31, 2017 when the impairment review is performed.\nIncome Taxes - In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, as well as net operating losses, tax credits and other carryforwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and, in particular, any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years, and match this forecast against the basis differences, deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \"Income Taxes.\" Among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity's financial statements. It also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if, as of the balance sheet reporting date, it is \"more likely than not\" (i.e., more than a 50% likelihood) that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits. When making this assessment, management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information. The accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a company's income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\nWarranty - We generally warrant our products for up to 36 months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs. If actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates, adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made.\nShare-Based Compensation - We calculate share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of share-based awards. The key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Prior to January 1, 2017, stock-based compensation expense included estimated effects of forfeitures. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\", in 2017, an accounting policy election was made to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amended guidance requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement, rather than through equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The amended guidance also allows for an employer to repurchase additional employee shares for tax withholding purposes without requiring liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid for withheld shares were applied retrospectively to all periods presented.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nNet Sales.

Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 13% to approximately 150,000 units, driven primarily by a 25% and 13% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and casino and gaming market, respectively and, to a lesser extent a 3% decrease in the lottery market and 13% decrease in the restaurant solutions market. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume of 112% in the Printrex market. The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreased volume of POS automation and banking printers sold in 2017, which carry lower prices than our other products.\nOverall, international sales decreased $4,102,000, or 35%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international casino and gaming market. This decrease was partially offset by a $1 million sales increase in our international lottery market during 2017.\nRestaurant solutions: Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and \"enjoy by\" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations. A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,384\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,747\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (363\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (41\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald's, increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal and the initial sales of our AccuDate XL terminal in 2017. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we begin to realize the benefits from the strategic selling and marketing investments made during 2017.\nInternational restaurant solution terminals decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower sales to our Latin American and Canadian distributors.\nPOS automation and banking: Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal and impact printers used primarily by restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick serve and hospitality establishments) located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels. In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations. A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,596\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,158\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (22.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (455\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (59.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,613\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (24.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a 23% decrease in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 to McDonald's to decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives that use the Ithaca\u00ae 9000 which began in 2015. Additionally, we experienced a 37% decline in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during 2018, as we continue to deemphasize these products and shift focus to our newer restaurant solutions products.\nCasino and gaming: Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals (\"VLTs\"), and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins (\"ticket-in, ticket-out\" or \"TITO\") at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide. Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments. Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology. In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRAL\u2122 print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine. A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 73.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,553\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 55.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,055\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,007\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 26.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,453\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,446\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (47.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,391\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to 26% higher sales of our thermal casino printers due mainly to market share gain, including higher sales to our OEMs to support two new casino openings. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in domestic EPICENTRAL\u2122 software sales of 34%. We completed two EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in both 2017 and 2016, however in 2017 our installations consisted of one full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122 and our first EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE version compared to two full-feature versions of EPICENTRAL\u2122 in 2016. Our EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE software is offered at a lower price compared to our full-feature version of EPICENTRAL\u2122. Sales of EPICENTRAL\u2122 are project based and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\nInternational casino and gaming printer sales declined in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our thermal casino printers in Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to our former exclusive worldwide distributor in Europe and Australia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. International EPICENTRAL\u2122 software sales also declined 79% as we completed no international EPICENTRAL\u2122 installations in 2017 compared to one completed international installation in 2016. In 2018, we expect to see an increase in international casino and gaming sales as we complete the transition away from our exclusive worldwide distributor and begin to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.\nLottery: Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to IGT and its subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,626\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 88.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,710\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 98.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,084\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.2\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,179\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 480.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,913\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. While we expect to increase sales of our lottery printers to other customers, based on our backlog of orders and customer forecasts, we expect lottery printer sales to be lower in 2018 compared to 2017.\nInternational lottery sales increased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in 2017 and no comparable sales occurring in 2016.\nPrintrex: Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies. Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 80.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 85.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 83.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 163.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,052\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in Printrex printers was due to an 83% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to higher demand in 2017 compared to 2016 and a 149% increase in sales of medical and mobile printers primarily due to sales of our mobile printer to one customer. We expect 2018 Printrex sales to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas market to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solution and casino and gaming products.\nTSG: Revenue from TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges. A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,657\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,342\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (33.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,096\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in domestic revenue from TSG was due primarily to a 108% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher demand for spare parts in the lottery market in 2017. The increase, to a lesser extent, was also due to a 12% increase in project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2017 but did not occur to the same extent in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely for legacy POS and banking printers in 2017 compared to 2016. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments from IGT for spare parts for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2018 compared to the unusually high level of IGT spare parts sales in 2017.\nGross Profit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26,662\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,799\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 41.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations and maintenance of our EPICENTRAL\u00ae print system. Gross profit increased $2,863,000, or 12%, and our gross margin improved 570 basis points to a record 47.3%. These increases were driven by a more favorable sales mix in 2017 compared to 2016, as our 2017 sales included a greater proportion of spare parts sales and a lower portion of sales of POS automation and banking printers.\nOperating Expenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,303\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,425\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEngineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design and testing services, and supplies). Such expenses decreased $122,000 or 3%, due primarily to higher product development costs during 2016 related to the substantial completion of certain software development projects for our EPICENTRAL\u2122 software compared to 2017. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses to be higher in 2018 than in 2017 as we continue to expand our engineering staff to support the restaurant solutions market.\nOperating Expenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,561\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,907\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Such expenses increased $654,000, or 10%, as we completed the build-out of our internal infrastructure, including the hiring of a direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market in 2017. We expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017, as we expect to incur incremental selling and marketing expenses as we have terminated the relationship with our international casino and gaming distributor and we build-out our internal sales infrastructure to begin selling direct to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe in the first quarter of 2018.\nOperating Expenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,984\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,267\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $717,000, or 10%, due primarily to higher incentive compensation expenses incurred in 2017 compared to 2016 and higher recruiting expenses related to the expansion of our sales staff for our restaurant solutions market and European casino and gaming market. We expect general and administrative expenses in 2018 to be higher than 2017 due to recruiting expenses as we continue to expand our restaurant solutions sales and engineering staff and complete the planned expansion of sales staff for our European casino and gaming market.\nOperating Income. Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,814\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 31.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating income increased by $1,614,000, or 31%, primarily due to a 570 basis point improvement in gross margin on a favorable product mix, partially offset by a 7% increase in operating expenses in 2017 compared to 2016.\nInterest. We recorded net interest expense of $33,000 in 2017 compared to $26,000 in 2016.\nOther, net. We recorded other expense of $9,000 in 2017 compared to $4,000 in 2016. The change was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our U.K. subsidiary in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, we recorded a gain of $5,000 on the disposal of fixed assets in 2016.\nIncome Taxes.\nIn 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $3,561,000 at an effective tax rate of 52.6% compared to an income tax provision in 2016 of $1,553,000 at an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The effective tax rate in 2017 was negatively impacted by the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1,315,000 charge to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, not to exceed one year from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company is required to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Reform Act for which the accounting is complete. To the extent there are areas that are incomplete, but are capable of reasonable estimates, a provisional amount is required to be recorded by the Company. If a reasonable estimate is unable to be calculated, the Company is required to disclose why. The Company has recognized provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included the amount in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance from Treasury, the IRS and State Governments, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act.\nWe expect our annual effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 20% and 21%, due to the impact from the Tax Reform Act. Changes resulting from our ongoing evaluation may further impact our expected tax rate in 2018.\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2017 of $3,211,000, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $3,617,000, or $0.47 per diluted share, for 2016.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\nNet Sales.

Although net sales decreased, printer and terminal sales volume increased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015. Our printer and terminal volume increased to approximately 173,000 units, primarily due to 22% increases in both the POS automation and banking and restaurant solutions markets. The average selling price of our printers decreased less than 1% from 2016 to 2015. Overall, international sales decreased $2,253,000, or 16%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international lottery and casino and gaming markets.\nRestaurant solutions: A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,747\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,857\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 24.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,191\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to McDonald's and increased sales penetration to a growing number of existing and new end user customers through our U.S. distributor.\nInternational restaurant solutions terminal sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to increased sales to our Latin American distributor.\nPOS automation and banking: A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,180\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,574\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,838\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,680\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by a 38% increase in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer as we continued to supply printers to support new initiatives by McDonald's that started in 2015 and accelerated in 2016. This increase was partially offset by 43% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2016 compared to 2015 as we continued to deemphasize these products.\nCasino and gaming: A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,553\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 55.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,354\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 52.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,453\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,401\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 47.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (948\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (9.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,755\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2016, domestic casino and gaming sales increased 2%, primarily due to a 37% increase in EPICENTRALTM software sales as we completed two domestic installations in 2016 compared to one domestic installation in 2015. Domestic sales of our thermal casino printers during 2016 were consistent with sales in 2015.\nInternational sales declined in 2016 due to 28% lower sales of our thermal casino printer in Europe and Asia compared to 2015. The decrease from our thermal casino printers was partially offset by increased off-premises thermal gaming printers and EPICENTRALTM software sales of 38% and 121%, respectively. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers increased due to an expanding market for sports betting in Europe and Australia. However, sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The increase in EPICENTRALTM software sales was due to one new international installation completed in 2016 compared to no international installations completed in 2015.\nLottery: A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,710\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 98.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,064\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 85.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,646\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 20.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,404\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1,201\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (85.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,913\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,468\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue.\nInternational lottery sales decreased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Spanish lottery in 2015 and no comparable international sales occurring in 2016.\nPrintrex: A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 85.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,088\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 78.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (625\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (57.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (216\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (73.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,381\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (841\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (60.9\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in Printrex printers was primarily due to a 52% decline in domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market due to the continued impact from the decline in worldwide oil prices. In addition, we experienced a 79% decline in medical and mobile printer sales due largely to the loss of a customer in the medical industry and as we shifted our sales focus towards the restaurant solutions market.\nTSG: A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,187\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 93.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,872\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (29.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (75\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,096\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,043\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,947\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (28.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in domestic revenue from TSG was due to a (1) 38% decrease in sales of replacement parts due mainly to IGT's purchase of an unusually high volume of spare parts for the lottery market in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016, (2) 19% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely from the decline of HP inkjet cartridges, as we continued to deemphasize the commoditized POS and banking consumable products, (3) 18% decline in service revenue, primarily due to project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2015 that did not recur to the same extent in 2016, and (4) 62% decrease of consumables sales for our Printrex color printer due to lower printing usage resulting from reduced drilling activity caused by the decline in worldwide oil prices.\nInternationally, TSG revenue decreased, primarily due to 8% and 37% lower sales of replacement parts and accessories and non-Printrex consumables, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nGross Profit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,799\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,978\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 41.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 41.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit decreased $1,179,000, or 5%, due primarily to a 4% decrease in sales.

Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,907\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,806\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased $899,000, or 12%, primarily due to lower compensation costs related to headcount reductions made during 2016, lower sales commission due to lower sales experienced in 2016 compared to 2015, and a decrease in travel expenses we consciously decided to reduce these expenses.\nOperating Expenses - General and Administrative.

Legal fees and settlement expenses information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,738\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (100.0\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs disclosed in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2012, AD filed a civil complaint against the Company. In connection with this lawsuit, we incurred legal fees and settlement expenses of $0 and $1,738,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The AD lawsuit was settled in March 2015.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,468\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating income increased by $732,000, or 16%, primarily due to lower legal fees and settlement expenses incurred in 2016, partially offset by 4% lower sales, compared to 2015.\nInterest. We recorded net interest expense of $26,000 in 2016 compared to $28,000 in 2015. Interest expense was higher in 2015 due to interest expense incurred from borrowing $2,500,000 to pay the AD lawsuit settlement in 2015. We did not borrow any funds during 2016.\nOther, net. We recorded other expense of $4,000 in 2016 compared to other income of $2,000 in 2015. The change was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our U.K. subsidiary in 2016 compared to 2015.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of $1,553,000 in 2016 compared to $1,350,000 in 2015. Our effective tax rate for 2016 of 30.0% remained relatively consistent with the effective tax rate in 2015 of 30.4%.\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2016 of $3,617,000, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $3,092,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, for 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.\nInternal cash generation together with currently available cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing facilities and an ability to access credit lines, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments and any increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity. We actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current business. While a significant acquisition may require additional debt and/or equity financing, although no assurances can be given, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our historical earnings performance.\nCash Flow\nDuring 2017 our cash balance increased $3,004,000, or 120%, from December 31, 2016 and we returned a substantial portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of $2,581,000 of cash dividends paid to common shareholders and $358,000 of repurchases of our common stock. Even after funding these items and our capital expenditures, we still ended 2017 with $5,507,000 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $151,000 was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.\nOperating activities: The following significant factors primarily affected our cash provided by operating activities of $5,918,000 in 2017 as compared to $4,624,000 in 2016.

Expenditures in the 2017 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment, new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, leasehold improvements at our Ithaca, NY facility to upgrade to LED lighting. Expenditures in the 2016 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment and, to a lesser extent, new product tooling equipment and purchases of furniture and fixtures. During 2017 we also incurred $150,000 of additions to capitalized software for enhancements to our restaurant solutions software.\nCapital expenditures and additions to capitalized software for 2018 are expected to be approximately $2,000,000, primarily for software development for our restaurant solutions products, new product tooling, and tooling enhancements for our existing products, as well as for new computer software and equipment purchases.\nFinancing activities: We used $1,919,000 of cash from financing activities during 2017 to pay dividends of $2,581,000 to common shareholders, purchase $358,000 of common stock for treasury and $23,000 related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $1,043,000. During 2016, we used $5,964,000 of cash from financing activities to purchase $3,571,000 of common stock for treasury and pay cash dividends of $2,416,000 to common shareholders, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $23,000.\nResource Sufficiency\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.\nCredit Facility and Borrowings\nWe maintain a credit facility (the \"TD Bank Credit Facility\") with TD Bank N.A. (\"TD Bank) which provides for a $20,000,000 revolving credit line. On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022. Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets. We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12,500,000 from $10,000,000.\nThe TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at December 31, 2017.\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td>\nFinancial Covenant\n</td> <td> Requirement/Restriction\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Calculation at December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating cash flow / Total debt service\n</td> <td> Minimum of 1.25 times\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 64.19\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funded debt / EBITDA\n</td> <td> Maximum of 3.0 times\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0 times\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, undrawn commitments under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20,000,000.\nShareholder Dividend Payments\nIn September 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program, with an initial quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share, subject to the Board's approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $2,581,000 or $0.35 per share and $2,416,000 or $0.32 per share, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. On February 5, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the first quarter 2018 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about March 15, 2018 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018.\nStock Repurchase Program\nPrior to its expiration on December 31, 2017, we maintained a stock repurchase program (the \"2016 Stock Repurchase Program\") whereby we were authorized to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. From January 1, 2017 through the expiration date of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, we purchased 36,465 shares of our common stock for $358,000 at an average price of $9.84 per share. From the start of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program on February 25, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we purchased 499,843 shares of our common stock for $3,929,000 at an average price of $7.86 per share.\nIn 2015, under a prior stock repurchase program, we purchased 166,553 shares of our common stock for $1,020,000 at an average price of $6.12 per share. From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of 3,888,432 shares of common stock for $30,110,000, at an average price of $7.74 per share, under the prior stock repurchase program.\nOn March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the \"2018 Stock Repurchase Program\") substantially similar to the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, whereby we are authorized to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue it prior to such time.\nShareholders' Equity\nShareholders' equity increased $1,905,000 to $26,014,000 at December 31, 2017 from $24,109,000 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to net income of $3,211,000, as well as $1,014,000 from the issuance of 181,195 shares of common stock related to employee stock awards, net of relinquishments and share-based compensation expense related to stock awards of $609,000. These increases were partially offset by our payment of $2,581,000 in dividends and the purchase of 36,465 shares of treasury stock for $358,000.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> < 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> > 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,305\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,029\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,155\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 12,296\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,285\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,601\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,285\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,040\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,121\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,155\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPurchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily of fully assembled printers and component part inventory.\nImpact of Inflation\nWe believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years. However, inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in Asia, as well as the cost of certain raw materials, component parts and labor used in the production of our products. It also may increase our operating expenses, manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets. We have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent, price increases, and we expect to be able to do the same during 2018. As such, we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during 2018.", "item_7_truncated": "Printrex: A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nNet sales for 2017 decreased $924,000, or 2%, from 2016. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 13% to approximately 150,000 units, driven primarily by a 25% and 13% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and casino and gaming market, respectively and, to a lesser extent a 3% decrease in the lottery market and 13% decrease in the restaurant solutions market. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume of 112% in the Printrex market.

TSG sales increased 40% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to unusually high sales of replacement parts to IGT for a legacy lottery printer in 2017 that did not occur at the same level in 2016. Although the installed base of our thermal lottery printers continues to grow and lotteries continue to extend lottery contracts utilizing our existing hardware, including our printer, based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments from IGT for spare parts, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2018 due to the higher than normal IGT spare parts sales in 2017.\nTable 83: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Percent of\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total Sales - 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,200\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,468\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to 26% higher sales of our thermal casino printers due mainly to market share gain, including higher sales to our OEMs to support two new casino openings. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in domestic EPICENTRALTM software sales of 34%. We completed two EPICENTRALTM installations in both 2017 and 2016, however in 2017 our installations consisted of one full-feature version of EPICENTRALTM and our first EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE version compared to two full-feature versions of EPICENTRALTM in 2016.

In 2018, we expect to see an increase in international casino and gaming sales as we complete the transition away from our exclusive worldwide distributor and begin to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.\n\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,187\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 93.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,872\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (29.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (75\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (8.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,096\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,043\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,947\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (28.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf We recorded depreciation and amortization of $1,31,000 and share-based compensation expense of $611,000. \nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,180\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,574\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,838\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,680\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u25cf We reported a net income of $3,617,000. \nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,657\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,342\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 46.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (262\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (33.5\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,096\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect our annual effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 20% and 21%, due to the impact from the Tax Reform Act.

General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOther, net. We recorded other expense of $9,000 in 2017 compared to $4,000 in 2016. The change was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our U.K. subsidiary in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, we recorded a gain of $5,000 on the disposal of fixed assets in 2016.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \"Income Taxes.\" Among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity's financial statements. It also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if, as of the balance sheet reporting date, it is \"more likely than not\" (i.e., more than a 50% likelihood) that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits. When making this assessment, management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information. The accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a company's income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\n\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant solutions\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,758\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,162\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (404\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (7.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> POS automation and banking\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,613\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (24.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Casino and gaming\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,615\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,006\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 36.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,391\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (11.4\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lottery\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,805\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,913\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (108\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Printrex\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,052\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 94.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TSG\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,176\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 25.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,096\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,080\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 56,311\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (924\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShare-Based Compensation - We calculate share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of share-based awards. The key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Prior to January 1, 2017, stock-based compensation expense included estimated effects of forfeitures. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\", in 2017, an accounting policy election was made to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amended guidance requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement, rather than through equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The amended guidance also allows for an employer to repurchase additional employee shares for tax withholding purposes without requiring liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid for withheld shares were applied retrospectively to all periods presented.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\n \u25cf Accounts payable decreased $988,000, or 20%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 to support anticipated sales of our restaurant solutions terminals and subsequently paid in 2017. \nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 31, 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,596\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 96.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,754\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 92.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,158\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (22.1\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (455\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (59.6\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,518\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,613\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (24.8\n</td> <td> %)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales of our POS automation and banking products decreased 25% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the POS market, we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless labels for customers in the restaurant and quick serve markets. During 2017, sales of our POS automation and banking printers declined as sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales to continue to decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives that use the Ithaca\u00ae 9000 which began in 2015. POS automation and banking sales also decreased in 2017 due to a 37% decline in sales of our other legacy POS and banking printers. In the banking market, we focus mainly on supplying printers for use in bank teller stations at banks and financial institutions primarily in the U.S. Although we continue to provide printers to our existing banking and POS (non-McDonald's) customers, we have significantly reduced our focus on this market in order to increase our focus on the restaurant solutions market.\nCertain statements included in this report, including without limitation statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

This involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, as well as net operating losses, tax credits and other carryforwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nThe increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to McDonald's and increased sales penetration to a growing number of existing and new end user customers through our U.S. distributor.\n\n\nLottery: A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\n\nTSG: A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, not to exceed one year from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company is required to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Reform Act for which the accounting is complete. To the extent there are areas that are incomplete, but are capable of reasonable estimates, a provisional amount is required to be recorded by the Company. If a reasonable estimate is unable to be calculated, the Company is required to disclose why. The Company has recognized provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included the amount in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance from Treasury, the IRS and State Governments, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act.\n \u25cf Inventories decreased $834,000, or 9%, due to the sell through of inventory on hand during 2017. \n\nContractual Obligations\n \u25cf Accounts payable increased $2,255,000 due primarily to the purchase of inventory late in the fourth quarter to support the increased fourth quarter sales in 2016. \nThe decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a 23% decrease in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 to McDonald's to decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives that use the Ithaca\u00ae 9000 which began in 2015. Additionally, we experienced a 37% decline in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during 2018, as we continue to deemphasize these products and shift focus to our newer restaurant solutions products.\nLottery: Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to IGT and its subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nWe charge our customers for shipping and handling services. The amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships. Any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales.\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased $899,000, or 12%, primarily due to lower compensation costs related to headcount reductions made during 2016, lower sales commission due to lower sales experienced in 2016 compared to 2015, and a decrease in travel expenses we consciously decided to reduce these expenses.\nImpact of Inflation\nRestaurant solutions: Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and \"enjoy by\" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations. A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nEngineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design and testing services, and supplies). Such expenses decreased $122,000 or 3%, due primarily to higher product development costs during 2016 related to the substantial completion of certain software development projects for our EPICENTRALTM software compared to 2017. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses to be higher in 2018 than in 2017 as we continue to expand our engineering staff to support the restaurant solutions market.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of $1,553,000 in 2016 compared to $1,350,000 in 2015. Our effective tax rate for 2016 of 30.0% remained relatively consistent with the effective tax rate in 2015 of 30.4%.\nWarranty - We generally warrant our products for up to 36 months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs. If actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates, adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made.\n\n\n\nSales of our Printrex branded printers include wide format, rack mounted and vehicle mounted thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. Sales in this market also includes wide format vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. During 2017, we experienced 95% increase in Printrex product sales due primarily to the recovery of the worldwide oil and gas market that had been negatively impacted from multiple years of declining worldwide oil prices. Although we expect to see continued modest growth in the oil and gas markets during 2018, we do not anticipate significant contribution to total sales from our Printrex products as we shift our focus towards our higher value, technology enabled restaurant solution terminals and casino and gaming products.\nPrior to its expiration on December 31, 2017, we maintained a stock repurchase program (the \"2016 Stock Repurchase Program\") whereby we were authorized to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. From January 1, 2017 through the expiration date of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, we purchased 36,465 shares of our common stock for $358,000 at an average price of $9.84 per share. From the start of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program on February 25, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we purchased 499,843 shares of our common stock for $3,929,000 at an average price of $7.86 per share.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn 2015, under a prior stock repurchase program, we purchased 166,553 shares of our common stock for $1,020,000 at an average price of $6.12 per share. From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of 3,888,432 shares of common stock for $30,110,000, at an average price of $7.74 per share, under the prior stock repurchase program.\nInternational lottery sales decreased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Spanish lottery in 2015 and no comparable international sales occurring in 2016.\nOur operating income increased by $732,000, or 16%, primarily due to lower legal fees and settlement expenses incurred in 2016, partially offset by 4% lower sales, compared to 2015.\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nPurchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily of fully assembled printers and component part inventory.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both Balance Sheet items and Statement of Income categories. Such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances. We evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates. Actual results may differ from the original estimates.\nCapital expenditures and additions to capitalized software for 2018 are expected to be approximately $2,000,000, primarily for software development for our restaurant solutions products, new product tooling, and tooling enhancements for our existing products, as well as for new computer software and equipment purchases.\nIn the lottery market, we continue to hold a leading position based on our long-term relationship with IGT, our largest customer and the world's largest provider of lottery terminals. IGT has been our customer since 1995, and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them. During 2017, total lottery printer sales to IGT remained relatively consistent with 2016. A decrease of 11% in domestic lottery sales to IGT was almost entirely offset by a $1 million increase in international lottery sales to IGT due to a sale in 2017 for the Canadian lottery and no comparable sales in 2016. Our sales to IGT each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. Starting in 2015, we no longer have an exclusive arrangement with IGT. However, we continue to have a good relationship with IGT which we expect to continue, and we also have the ability to sell our market leading products to other lottery system customers.\nStock Repurchase Program\nRevenue Recognition - Our typical contracts include the sale of printers and terminals, which are sometimes accompanied by separately-priced extended warranty and technical support contracts. We also sell replacement parts, consumables, and other repair services (sometimes pursuant to multi-year product maintenance contracts), which are not included in the original printer or terminal sale and are ordered by the customer as needed. We recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605, \"Revenue Recognition\" (ASC 605). Specifically, revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery (based on shipping terms which are generally FOB shipping point) has occurred, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from the sale of printers and terminals to our distributors and resellers on a sell-in basis and on substantially the same terms as we recognize revenue from all our other customers. We provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition.\nGross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations and maintenance of our EPICENTRAL\u00ae print system. Gross profit increased $2,863,000, or 12%, and our gross margin improved 570 basis points to a record 47.3%. These increases were driven by a more favorable sales mix in 2017 compared to 2016, as our 2017 sales included a greater proportion of spare parts sales and a lower portion of sales of POS automation and banking printers.\nThe TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at December 31, 2017.\nFinancing activities: We used $1,919,000 of cash from financing activities during 2017 to pay dividends of $2,581,000 to common shareholders, purchase $358,000 of common stock for treasury and $23,000 related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $1,043,000. During 2016, we used $5,964,000 of cash from financing activities to purchase $3,571,000 of common stock for treasury and pay cash dividends of $2,416,000 to common shareholders, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $23,000.\n\nIn 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $3,561,000 at an effective tax rate of 52.6% compared to an income tax provision in 2016 of $1,553,000 at an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The effective tax rate in 2017 was negatively impacted by the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1,315,000 charge to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased $1,053,000, or 35%, due primarily to an increase in our accrued incentive compensation. \nForward Looking Statements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe decrease in domestic revenue from TSG was due to a (1) 38% decrease in sales of replacement parts due mainly to IGT's purchase of an unusually high volume of spare parts for the lottery market in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016, (2) 19% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely from the decline of HP inkjet cartridges, as we continued to deemphasize the commoditized POS and banking consumable products, (3) 18% decline in service revenue, primarily due to project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2015 that did not recur to the same extent in 2016, and (4) 62% decrease of consumables sales for our Printrex color printer due to lower printing usage resulting from reduced drilling activity caused by the decline in worldwide oil prices.\nResource Sufficiency\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and, in particular, any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years, and match this forecast against the basis differences, deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued to focus our efforts on sales execution and growing the revenue of our newer, value-added products and technologies. During the year we completed the build-out of our direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market. We expect the investments we have made during 2017 to result in increased sales in restaurant solutions as we begin to see significant sales contribution from our two newest products, the AccuDate Pro and AccuDate XL.\n\nInterest. We recorded net interest expense of $33,000 in 2017 compared to $26,000 in 2016.\nInternational lottery sales increased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in 2017 and no comparable sales occurring in 2016.\nThe increase in Printrex printers was due to an 83% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to higher demand in 2017 compared to 2016 and a 149% increase in sales of medical and mobile printers primarily due to sales of our mobile printer to one customer. We expect 2018 Printrex sales to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas market to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solution and casino and gaming products.\nWe maintain a credit facility (the \"TD Bank Credit Facility\") with TD Bank N.A. (\"TD Bank) which provides for a $20,000,000 revolving credit line. On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022. Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets. We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12,500,000 from $10,000,000.\nCasino and gaming: A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\n \u25cf Accounts receivable increased $355,000, or 3% due to a longer than normal collection process related to sales made to our international casino and gaming distributor. \nCasino and gaming: Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals (\"VLTs\"), and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins (\"ticket-in, ticket-out\" or \"TITO\") at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide. Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments. Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology. In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRALTM print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine. A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nShareholders' equity increased $1,905,000 to $26,014,000 at December 31, 2017 from $24,109,000 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to net income of $3,211,000, as well as $1,014,000 from the issuance of 181,195 shares of common stock related to employee stock awards, net of relinquishments and share-based compensation expense related to stock awards of $609,000. These increases were partially offset by our payment of $2,581,000 in dividends and the purchase of 36,465 shares of treasury stock for $358,000.\n\nTSG: Revenue from TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges. A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nThe following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are therefore based on our judgment. Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies.\n \u25cf Deferred income tax provision increased $1,117,000 largely due to a $1,315,000 charge to income tax expense in 2017 to revalue our net deferred tax asset due to the Tax Reform Act. \nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $100,000, or 1%, due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs incurred in 2016 compared to 2015, which was largely offset by higher severance cost related to headcount reductions made during 2016.\nRestaurant solutions: A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nInternal cash generation together with currently available cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing facilities and an ability to access credit lines, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments and any increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity. We actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current business. While a significant acquisition may require additional debt and/or equity financing, although no assurances can be given, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our historical earnings performance.\nNet sales for 2016 decreased $2,441,000, or 4%, from 2015. Although net sales decreased, printer and terminal sales volume increased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015. Our printer and terminal volume increased to approximately 173,000 units, primarily due to 22% increases in both the POS automation and banking and restaurant solutions markets. The average selling price of our printers decreased less than 1% from 2016 to 2015. Overall, international sales decreased $2,253,000, or 16%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international lottery and casino and gaming markets.\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRevenue, inclusive of software license fees, is generally recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer with the exception of any amount allocated to free maintenance which is deferred and recognized over the initial maintenance period, generally one year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $1,088,000 due primarily to lower accrued incentive compensation costs and deferred revenue in 2016 compared to 2015. \nAccounts Receivable - We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including: credit reviews of all new customer accounts; ongoing credit evaluations of current customers; credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information; and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness. We also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $100,000, or less than 1% of outstanding accounts receivable, which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.\nGross profit decreased $1,179,000, or 5%, due primarily to a 4% decrease in sales. Our gross margin remained relatively consistent, decreasing slightly by 30 basis points compared 2015, to 41.6%.\nInternational sales declined in 2016 due to 28% lower sales of our thermal casino printer in Europe and Asia compared to 2015. The decrease from our thermal casino printers was partially offset by increased off-premises thermal gaming printers and EPICENTRALTM software sales of 38% and 121%, respectively. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers increased due to an expanding market for sports betting in Europe and Australia. However, sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The increase in EPICENTRALTM software sales was due to one new international installation completed in 2016 compared to no international installations completed in 2015.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - We acquire businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with ASC 350-20 \"Goodwill\", acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change, that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. We reported $2,621,000 of goodwill and $458,000 of unamortized definite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2017. We have determined that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment has occurred and the fair value of goodwill was substantially higher than our carrying value based on our assessment as of December 31, 2017 when the impairment review is performed.\nGross Profit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. While we expect to increase sales of our lottery printers to other customers, based on our backlog of orders and customer forecasts, we expect lottery printer sales to be lower in 2018 compared to 2017.\nDuring 2016, domestic casino and gaming sales increased 2%, primarily due to a 37% increase in EPICENTRALTM software sales as we completed two domestic installations in 2016 compared to one domestic installation in 2015. Domestic sales of our thermal casino printers during 2016 were consistent with sales in 2015.\nWe believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years. However, inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in Asia, as well as the cost of certain raw materials, component parts and labor used in the production of our products. It also may increase our operating expenses, manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets. We have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent, price increases, and we expect to be able to do the same during 2018. As such, we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during 2018.\nOn March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the \"2018 Stock Repurchase Program\") substantially similar to the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, whereby we are authorized to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue it prior to such time.\nWe reported net income of $3,211,000 and net income per diluted share of $0.42 for 2017, compared to $3,617,000 and net income per diluted share of $0.47 for 2016. In terms of cash flow for 2017, we experienced a very strong year, generating $5,918,000 of cash from operating activities. We also returned $2,939,000 to our shareholders in the form of $358,000 for treasury share repurchases and $2,581,000 for cash dividends and finishing the year with cash and cash equivalents of $5,507,000 and no debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017.\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue.\n\nOperating activities: The following significant factors primarily affected our cash provided by operating activities of $5,918,000 in 2017 as compared to $4,624,000 in 2016. During 2017:\nInternational restaurant solutions terminal sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to increased sales to our Latin American distributor.\nThe increase in domestic revenue from TSG was due primarily to a 108% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher demand for spare parts in the lottery market in 2017. The increase, to a lesser extent, was also due to a 12% increase in project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2017 but did not occur to the same extent in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely for legacy POS and banking printers in 2017 compared to 2016. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments from IGT for spare parts for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2018 compared to the unusually high level of IGT spare parts sales in 2017.\nAs disclosed in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2012, AD filed a civil complaint against the Company. In connection with this lawsuit, we incurred legal fees and settlement expenses of $0 and $1,738,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The AD lawsuit was settled in March 2015.\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald's, increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal and the initial sales of our AccuDate XL terminal in 2017. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we begin to realize the benefits from the strategic selling and marketing investments made during 2017.\nSales of our casino and gaming products decreased 11% in 2017 compared to 2016. In our casino and gaming market, our focus lies primarily in supplying printers worldwide for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks, as well as in other electronic gaming devices that print tickets or receipts. Additionally, we supplement these printer sales with revenue from EPICENTRALTM, our promotional printing system that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and print them real time at the slot machine. The decrease of casino and gaming printer sales is primarily due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers and 46% decrease in international sales of the EPIC 950, our thermal casino printer, due to continued sluggishness in Europe, Australia and Asia, including significantly lower sales to our former exclusive worldwide distributor. Effective December 31, 2017, we terminated the relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor and have begun to develop an internal sales team to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. Domestic casino and gaming printer sales increased 22% due mainly to higher sales to our OEMs to support new casino openings and market share gains. Sales of our EPICENTRALTM software decreased 42% as we completed two installations worldwide in 2017 compared to three installations in 2016.\nPOS automation and banking: Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal and impact printers used primarily by restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick serve and hospitality establishments) located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels. In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations. A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nOperating Expenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOverall, international sales decreased $4,102,000, or 35%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international casino and gaming market. This decrease was partially offset by a $1 million sales increase in our international lottery market during 2017.\n * International sales do not include sales of products made to domestic distributors or other customers who in turn ship those products to international destinations. \n\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2017 of $3,211,000, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $3,617,000, or $0.47 per diluted share, for 2016.\nPOS automation and banking: A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nDuring 2016:\nEngineering, design and product development expenses increased $826,000 or 23%, due primarily to higher product development costs and the hiring of additional software engineers beginning in early 2016, as we focused and strategically invested in enhancements to our EPICENTRALTM software and expansion of our line of restaurant solutions terminals.\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Such expenses increased $654,000, or 10%, as we completed the build-out of our internal infrastructure, including the hiring of a direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market in 2017. We expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017, as we expect to incur incremental selling and marketing expenses as we have terminated the relationship with our international casino and gaming distributor and we build-out our internal sales infrastructure to begin selling direct to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nThe increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by a 38% increase in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer as we continued to supply printers to support new initiatives by McDonald's that started in 2015 and accelerated in 2016. This increase was partially offset by 43% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2016 compared to 2015 as we continued to deemphasize these products.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.\n\nOperating Expenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOur operating income increased by $1,614,000, or 31%, primarily due to a 570 basis point improvement in gross margin on a favorable product mix, partially offset by a 7% increase in operating expenses in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIncome Taxes.\nDuring 2017 our cash balance increased $3,004,000, or 120%, from December 31, 2016 and we returned a substantial portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of $2,581,000 of cash dividends paid to common shareholders and $358,000 of repurchases of our common stock. Even after funding these items and our capital expenditures, we still ended 2017 with $5,507,000 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $151,000 was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.\nDuring 2017, our total net sales decreased 2% to approximately $56,311,000. See the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market:\nOperationally, our gross margin reached 47.3% in 2017, an increase of 570 basis points from 2016, representing the highest gross margin we have reported for a full year. We believe gross margin will continue at these levels in 2018 as our newer, technology-enabled products continue to grow and become a larger portion of our overall sales. In 2017, we achieved operating margin of 12.1% compared to 9.1% in 2016 due to our improved gross margin that was partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily to support our two high growth markets--restaurant solutions and casino and gaming. During 2018, we expect higher operating expenses compared to 2017, as we continue to increase our investments in selling and marketing in these two high growth markets, as we believe these represent TransAct's most significant, long term growth opportunity.\nOther, net. We recorded other expense of $4,000 in 2016 compared to other income of $2,000 in 2015. The change was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our U.K. subsidiary in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\nDuring 2018, we plan to strategically invest in our sales and marketing for our European casino and gaming market. Effective December 31, 2017, we terminated the relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor and began building an internal sales team to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. As a result of this investment we expect international casino and gaming sales will increase in 2018 compared to 2017. During 2017, sales for our POS automation and banking market decreased as sales to McDonald's began to slow during 2017 compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales of our POS automation and banking market to decrease in 2018 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives which began in 2015 and we shift of our focus toward the restaurant solutions market and casino and gaming market. These decreases were partially offset by increased TSG sales due to higher sales of spare parts in the lottery market in 2017 to IGT compared to 2016.\nOur customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery. We monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience. Returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns.\nThe decrease in Printrex printers was primarily due to a 52% decline in domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market due to the continued impact from the decline in worldwide oil prices. In addition, we experienced a 79% decline in medical and mobile printer sales due largely to the loss of a customer in the medical industry and as we shifted our sales focus towards the restaurant solutions market.\nFor EPICENTRALTM and other multiple deliverable arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables in an arrangement are within the scope of existing higher-level generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and apply such literature to the extent that it provides guidance regarding whether to separate multiple-deliverable arrangements and how to allocate value among those separate units of accounting. When we enter into a multiple deliverable arrangement, we also determine whether revenue arrangements consist of more than one unit of accounting. At that time, we allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy, except where amounts allocable to the delivered units is limited to that which is contingent upon the delivery of additional deliverables or meeting other specified performance conditions. The relative selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") if available, third party evidence (\"TPE\") if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\") to the extent that VSOE or TPE are not available.", "item_7_text": "Printrex: A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nNet sales for 2017 decreased $924,000, or 2%, from 2016. Printer and terminal sales volume decreased by 13% to approximately 150,000 units, driven primarily by a 25% and 13% decrease in unit volume from the POS automation and banking market and casino and gaming market, respectively and, to a lesser extent a 3% decrease in the lottery market and 13% decrease in the restaurant solutions market. These decreases were partially offset by increased sales volume of 112% in the Printrex market. The average selling price of our printers and terminals increased 4% in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to decreased volume of POS automation and banking printers sold in 2017, which carry lower prices than our other products.\nOperating Expenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n \u25cf Inventories decreased $1,580,000 due to the sell through of inventory on hand during 2016. \nOperating Expenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our executive, accounting, human resource and information technology staff, expenses for our corporate headquarters, professional and legal expenses, telecommunication expenses, and other expenses related to being a publicly-traded company. General and administrative expenses increased $717,000, or 10%, due primarily to higher incentive compensation expenses incurred in 2017 compared to 2016 and higher recruiting expenses related to the expansion of our sales staff for our restaurant solutions market and European casino and gaming market. We expect general and administrative expenses in 2018 to be higher than 2017 due to recruiting expenses as we continue to expand our restaurant solutions sales and engineering staff and complete the planned expansion of sales staff for our European casino and gaming market.\n\nOperating Expenses - Legal Fees and Settlement Expenses Associated with Lawsuit. Legal fees and settlement expenses information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOverview\nPrintrex: Printrex branded printers are sold into markets that include wide format, desktop and rack mounted and vehicle mounted black/white thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field, seismic and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. It also includes high-speed color inkjet desktop printers used to print logs at the data centers of the oil and gas field service companies. Revenue in this market also includes sales of vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide Printrex printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nGross Profit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nWe offer some of our customers price protection as an incentive to carry inventory of our product. These price protection plans provide that if we lower prices, we will credit them for the price decrease on inventory they hold. Our customers typically carry limited amounts of inventory, and we infrequently lower prices on current products. As a result, the amounts paid under these plans have not been material. However, we cannot guarantee that this minimal level will continue.\nOur software solution, EPICENTRALTM, enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them in real-time at the slot machine. Revenue arrangements for EPICENTRALTM include multiple deliverables and as a result such arrangements are accounted for in accordance with both ASC 605-25, \"Multiple-Element Arrangements\" and ASC 985-605, \"Software.\" EPICENTRALTM is primarily comprised of both a software component, which is licensed to the customer, and a hardware component. EPICENTRALTM contains both software and hardware that are integrated to deliver the system's full functionality. These arrangements are accounted for in accordance with ASC 605-25, \"Multiple-Element Arrangements\". EPICENTRALTM can also include an additional software offering, Mobile Host, that allows the customer to access certain applications on mobile devices. Mobile Host is accounted for in accordance with ASC 985-605, \"Software\" as Mobile Host software does not function together with the hardware device to deliver its essential functionality.\n\nInterest. We recorded net interest expense of $26,000 in 2016 compared to $28,000 in 2015. Interest expense was higher in 2015 due to interest expense incurred from borrowing $2,500,000 to pay the AD lawsuit settlement in 2015. We did not borrow any funds during 2016.\nInternationally, TSG revenue decreased, primarily due to 8% and 37% lower sales of replacement parts and accessories and non-Printrex consumables, respectively, in 2016 compared to 2015.\nInvesting activities: Our capital expenditures were $835,000 and $608,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Expenditures in the 2017 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment, new product tooling equipment and, to a lesser extent, leasehold improvements at our Ithaca, NY facility to upgrade to LED lighting. Expenditures in the 2016 period were primarily for computer and networking equipment and, to a lesser extent, new product tooling equipment and purchases of furniture and fixtures. During 2017 we also incurred $150,000 of additions to capitalized software for enhancements to our restaurant solutions software.\n\n\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2016 of $3,617,000, or $0.47 per diluted share, compared to $3,092,000, or $0.39 per diluted share, for 2015.\nCash Flow\nOur TSG group, which sells service, replacement parts and consumable products, including food safety labels, receipt paper, ribbons and inkjet cartridges, continues to offer a recurring revenue stream for the Company. TSG sales increased 40% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to unusually high sales of replacement parts to IGT for a legacy lottery printer in 2017 that did not occur at the same level in 2016. Although the installed base of our thermal lottery printers continues to grow and lotteries continue to extend lottery contracts utilizing our existing hardware, including our printer, based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments from IGT for spare parts, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2018 due to the higher than normal IGT spare parts sales in 2017.\nThe increase in domestic sales of our casino and gaming products in 2017 compared to 2016 was due primarily to 26% higher sales of our thermal casino printers due mainly to market share gain, including higher sales to our OEMs to support two new casino openings. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in domestic EPICENTRALTM software sales of 34%. We completed two EPICENTRALTM installations in both 2017 and 2016, however in 2017 our installations consisted of one full-feature version of EPICENTRALTM and our first EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE version compared to two full-feature versions of EPICENTRALTM in 2016. Our EPICENTRAL\u00ae SE software is offered at a lower price compared to our full-feature version of EPICENTRALTM. Sales of EPICENTRALTM are project based and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year.\n\nInternational casino and gaming printer sales declined in 2017 compared to 2016 due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our thermal casino printers in Europe, Asia and Australia, as well as a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers to our former exclusive worldwide distributor in Europe and Australia. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. International EPICENTRALTM software sales also declined 79% as we completed no international EPICENTRALTM installations in 2017 compared to one completed international installation in 2016. In 2018, we expect to see an increase in international casino and gaming sales as we complete the transition away from our exclusive worldwide distributor and begin to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe.\n\n \u25cf We recorded depreciation and amortization of $1,31,000 and share-based compensation expense of $611,000. \n \u25cf We reported a net income of $3,617,000. \nWe expect our annual effective tax rate for 2018 to be between 20% and 21%, due to the impact from the Tax Reform Act. Changes resulting from our ongoing evaluation may further impact our expected tax rate in 2018.\n \u25cf We reported a net income of $3,211,000. \n \u25cf We recorded depreciation and amortization of $1,081,000 and share-based compensation expense of $609,000. \nOperating Expenses - Selling and Marketing. Selling and marketing information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nIn September 2012, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend program, with an initial quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share, subject to the Board's approval each quarter. Our Board of Directors declared an increase to the quarterly cash dividend $0.06 to $0.07 per share in May 2013, from $0.07 to $0.08 per share in May 2014, and from $0.08 to $0.09 per share in May 2017. Dividends declared and paid on our common stock totaled $2,581,000 or $0.35 per share and $2,416,000 or $0.32 per share, in 2017 and 2016, respectively. On February 5, 2018, our Board of Directors approved the first quarter 2018 dividend in the amount of $0.09 per share payable on or about March 15, 2018 to common shareholders of record at the close of business on February 20, 2018.\nRevenue related to extended warranty and product maintenance contracts is recognized pursuant to ASC 605-20-25, \"Separately Priced Extended Warranty and Product Maintenance Contracts.\" Pursuant to this guidance, revenue related to separately priced product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized over the term of the maintenance period. We record deferred revenue for advance payments received from customers for maintenance contracts.\n\nOperating Income. Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n * International sales do not include sales of products made to domestic distributors or other customers who in turn ship those products to international destinations. \n\nInventories - Our inventories are stated at the lower of cost (principally standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. We review net realizable value based on estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs of completion, disposal and transportation, historical usage and estimates of future demand. Assumptions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjustments are made, as necessary, to reflect changing market conditions. Based on these reviews, inventory write-downs are recorded, as necessary, to reflect estimated obsolescence, excess quantities and net realizable value. Should circumstances change and we determine that additional inventory is subject to obsolescence, additional write-downs of inventory could result in a charge to income.\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\n\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2017 compared to Year ended December 31, 2016\nSales of our restaurant solutions products decreased 8% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the restaurant solutions market, our focus lies with providing terminals that print food rotational date and nutritional labels to help restaurants and other food service establishments effectively manage food rotation and safety. The decrease in restaurant solutions sales resulted from lower sales of our AccuDateTM 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal and the initial sales of our AccuDate XL terminal in 2017. Our focus for 2018 will be to capitalize on the 2017 investments made in creating our direct selling model and in our latest terminal, the AccuDate XL.\nInternational restaurant solution terminals decreased during 2017 compared to 2016 due to lower sales to our Latin American and Canadian distributors.\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. Significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments, access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long-term capital with satisfactory terms.\nOperating Expenses - General and Administrative. General and administrative information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\n\nOther, net. We recorded other expense of $9,000 in 2017 compared to $4,000 in 2016. The change was due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our U.K. subsidiary in 2017 compared to 2016. In addition, we recorded a gain of $5,000 on the disposal of fixed assets in 2016.\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, \"Income Taxes.\" Among other things this provision prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity's financial statements. It also requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if, as of the balance sheet reporting date, it is \"more likely than not\" (i.e., more than a 50% likelihood) that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits. When making this assessment, management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information. The accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed, or expected to be claimed, on a company's income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\n\nShare-Based Compensation - We calculate share-based compensation expense in accordance with ASC 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the fair value of share-based awards. The key assumptions for this valuation method include the expected term of an option grant, stock price volatility, risk-free interest rate, and dividend yield. Prior to January 1, 2017, stock-based compensation expense included estimated effects of forfeitures. Upon adoption of Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-09, \"Compensation-Stock Compensation: Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting\", in 2017, an accounting policy election was made to account for forfeitures as they occur. The amended guidance requires that all tax effects related to share-based payments are recorded at settlement (or expiration) through the income statement, rather than through equity. Cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other income tax cash flows. The amended guidance also allows for an employer to repurchase additional employee shares for tax withholding purposes without requiring liability accounting and clarifies that all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee's behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing activity on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation requirements for cash flows related to excess tax benefits and employee taxes paid for withheld shares were applied retrospectively to all periods presented.\nResults of Operations: Year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015\n \u25cf Accounts payable decreased $988,000, or 20%, due primarily to increased inventory purchases made towards the end of the fourth quarter of 2016 to support anticipated sales of our restaurant solutions terminals and subsequently paid in 2017. \nSales of our POS automation and banking products decreased 25% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. In the POS market, we focus primarily on supplying printers that print receipts or linerless labels for customers in the restaurant and quick serve markets. During 2017, sales of our POS automation and banking printers declined as sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales to continue to decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives that use the Ithaca\u00ae 9000 which began in 2015. POS automation and banking sales also decreased in 2017 due to a 37% decline in sales of our other legacy POS and banking printers. In the banking market, we focus mainly on supplying printers for use in bank teller stations at banks and financial institutions primarily in the U.S. Although we continue to provide printers to our existing banking and POS (non-McDonald's) customers, we have significantly reduced our focus on this market in order to increase our focus on the restaurant solutions market.\nCertain statements included in this report, including without limitation statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which are not historical facts are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. (the \"Exchange Act\")Forward-looking statements generally can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as \"may\", \"will\", \"expect\", \"intend\", \"estimate\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"project\" or \"continue\" or the negative thereof or other similar words. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those listed in Item 1A of this Annual Report and such other risk and uncertainties as are described in our reports filed with the SEC from time to time.. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report and we assume no duty to update them.\nOperating Income (Loss). Operating income information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nShareholders' Equity\nCredit Facility and Borrowings\nShareholder Dividend Payments\nAs of December 31, 2017, undrawn commitments under the TD Bank Credit facility were $20,000,000.\n \u25cf Accounts receivable increased $3,434,000 due primarily to the large amount of sales occurring late in the fourth quarter of 2016 compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. \nIncome Taxes - In preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. This involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences between the tax basis of certain assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements, as well as net operating losses, tax credits and other carryforwards. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included within our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income, and to the extent that we believe that realization is not likely, we establish a valuation allowance.\nThe increase in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by an increase in sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to McDonald's and increased sales penetration to a growing number of existing and new end user customers through our U.S. distributor.\n\n\nLottery: A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\n\nTSG: A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\") to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations where a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period, not to exceed one year from the enactment of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118, the Company is required to reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Reform Act for which the accounting is complete. To the extent there are areas that are incomplete, but are capable of reasonable estimates, a provisional amount is required to be recorded by the Company. If a reasonable estimate is unable to be calculated, the Company is required to disclose why. The Company has recognized provisional tax impacts related to the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and included the amount in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. The ultimate impact may differ from these provisional amounts, possibly materially, due to, among other things, additional analysis, changes in interpretations and assumptions, additional regulatory guidance from Treasury, the IRS and State Governments, and actions the Company may take as a result of the Tax Reform Act.\n \u25cf Inventories decreased $834,000, or 9%, due to the sell through of inventory on hand during 2017. \n\nContractual Obligations\n \u25cf Accounts payable increased $2,255,000 due primarily to the purchase of inventory late in the fourth quarter to support the increased fourth quarter sales in 2016. \nThe decrease in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by a 23% decrease in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer, as sales to McDonald's began to slow compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 to McDonald's to decrease in 2018 compared to 2017 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives that use the Ithaca\u00ae 9000 which began in 2015. Additionally, we experienced a 37% decline in sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2017 compared to 2016. We expect sales of these legacy products to continue to decline during 2018, as we continue to deemphasize these products and shift focus to our newer restaurant solutions products.\nLottery: Revenue from the lottery market includes sales of thermal on-line and other lottery printers primarily to IGT and its subsidiaries, and to a lesser extent, other lottery system companies for various lottery applications. A summary of sales of our worldwide lottery printers for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nWe charge our customers for shipping and handling services. The amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenue when the product ships. Any costs incurred related to these services are included in cost of sales.\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased $899,000, or 12%, primarily due to lower compensation costs related to headcount reductions made during 2016, lower sales commission due to lower sales experienced in 2016 compared to 2015, and a decrease in travel expenses we consciously decided to reduce these expenses.\nImpact of Inflation\nRestaurant solutions: Revenue from the restaurant solutions market includes sales of terminals that combine hardware and software in a device that includes an operating system, touchscreen and one or two thermal print mechanisms that print easy-to-read food rotation labels, grab and go labels for prepared foods, and \"enjoy by\" date labels to help food service establishments and restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick-serve convenience and hospitality establishments) effectively manage food safety and automate and manage back-of-the-restaurant operations. A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows (in thousands, except percentages):\nEngineering, design and product development expenses primarily include salary and payroll related expenses for our hardware and software engineering staff, depreciation and design expenses (including prototype printer expenses, outside design and testing services, and supplies). Such expenses decreased $122,000 or 3%, due primarily to higher product development costs during 2016 related to the substantial completion of certain software development projects for our EPICENTRALTM software compared to 2017. We expect engineering, design and product development expenses to be higher in 2018 than in 2017 as we continue to expand our engineering staff to support the restaurant solutions market.\nIncome Taxes. We recorded an income tax provision of $1,553,000 in 2016 compared to $1,350,000 in 2015. Our effective tax rate for 2016 of 30.0% remained relatively consistent with the effective tax rate in 2015 of 30.4%.\nWarranty - We generally warrant our products for up to 36 months and record the estimated cost of such product warranties at the time the sale is recorded. Estimated warranty costs are based upon actual past experience of product repairs and the related estimated cost of labor and material to make the necessary repairs. If actual future product repair rates or the actual costs of material and labor differ from the estimates, adjustments to the accrued warranty liability and related warranty expense would be made.\n\n\n\nSales of our Printrex branded printers include wide format, rack mounted and vehicle mounted thermal printers used by customers to log and plot oil field and down hole well drilling data in the oil and gas exploration industry. Sales in this market also includes wide format vehicle mounted printers used to print schematics and certain other critical information in emergency services vehicles and other mobile printing applications. During 2017, we experienced 95% increase in Printrex product sales due primarily to the recovery of the worldwide oil and gas market that had been negatively impacted from multiple years of declining worldwide oil prices. Although we expect to see continued modest growth in the oil and gas markets during 2018, we do not anticipate significant contribution to total sales from our Printrex products as we shift our focus towards our higher value, technology enabled restaurant solution terminals and casino and gaming products.\nPrior to its expiration on December 31, 2017, we maintained a stock repurchase program (the \"2016 Stock Repurchase Program\") whereby we were authorized to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. We use the cost method to account for treasury stock purchases, under which the price paid for the stock is charged to the treasury stock account. Repurchases of our common stock are accounted for as of the settlement date. From January 1, 2017 through the expiration date of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, we purchased 36,465 shares of our common stock for $358,000 at an average price of $9.84 per share. From the start of the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program on February 25, 2016 through December 31, 2017, we purchased 499,843 shares of our common stock for $3,929,000 at an average price of $7.86 per share.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn 2015, under a prior stock repurchase program, we purchased 166,553 shares of our common stock for $1,020,000 at an average price of $6.12 per share. From January 1, 2005 through December 31, 2017, we repurchased a total of 3,888,432 shares of common stock for $30,110,000, at an average price of $7.74 per share, under the prior stock repurchase program.\nInternational lottery sales decreased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Spanish lottery in 2015 and no comparable international sales occurring in 2016.\nOur operating income increased by $732,000, or 16%, primarily due to lower legal fees and settlement expenses incurred in 2016, partially offset by 4% lower sales, compared to 2015.\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 were as follows:\nPurchase obligations are for purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements, primarily of fully assembled printers and component part inventory.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect both Balance Sheet items and Statement of Income categories. Such estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and certain assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the particular circumstances. We evaluate our assumptions on an ongoing basis by comparing actual results with our estimates. Actual results may differ from the original estimates.\nCapital expenditures and additions to capitalized software for 2018 are expected to be approximately $2,000,000, primarily for software development for our restaurant solutions products, new product tooling, and tooling enhancements for our existing products, as well as for new computer software and equipment purchases.\nIn the lottery market, we continue to hold a leading position based on our long-term relationship with IGT, our largest customer and the world's largest provider of lottery terminals. IGT has been our customer since 1995, and we continue to maintain a good relationship with them. During 2017, total lottery printer sales to IGT remained relatively consistent with 2016. A decrease of 11% in domestic lottery sales to IGT was almost entirely offset by a $1 million increase in international lottery sales to IGT due to a sale in 2017 for the Canadian lottery and no comparable sales in 2016. Our sales to IGT each year are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. Starting in 2015, we no longer have an exclusive arrangement with IGT. However, we continue to have a good relationship with IGT which we expect to continue, and we also have the ability to sell our market leading products to other lottery system customers.\nStock Repurchase Program\nRevenue Recognition - Our typical contracts include the sale of printers and terminals, which are sometimes accompanied by separately-priced extended warranty and technical support contracts. We also sell replacement parts, consumables, and other repair services (sometimes pursuant to multi-year product maintenance contracts), which are not included in the original printer or terminal sale and are ordered by the customer as needed. We recognize revenue pursuant to the guidance within Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 605, \"Revenue Recognition\" (ASC 605). Specifically, revenue is recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery (based on shipping terms which are generally FOB shipping point) has occurred, the selling price is fixed and determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We recognize revenue from the sale of printers and terminals to our distributors and resellers on a sell-in basis and on substantially the same terms as we recognize revenue from all our other customers. We provide for an estimate of product returns and price protection based on historical experience at the time of revenue recognition.\nGross profit is measured as revenue less cost of sales, which includes primarily the cost of all raw materials and component parts, direct labor, manufacturing overhead expenses, cost of finished products purchased directly from our contract manufacturers and expenses associated with installations and maintenance of our EPICENTRAL\u00ae print system. Gross profit increased $2,863,000, or 12%, and our gross margin improved 570 basis points to a record 47.3%. These increases were driven by a more favorable sales mix in 2017 compared to 2016, as our 2017 sales included a greater proportion of spare parts sales and a lower portion of sales of POS automation and banking printers.\nThe TD Bank Credit Facility imposes certain quarterly financial covenants on us and restricts, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness and the creation of other liens. We were in compliance with all financial covenants of the TD Bank Credit Facility at December 31, 2017.\nFinancing activities: We used $1,919,000 of cash from financing activities during 2017 to pay dividends of $2,581,000 to common shareholders, purchase $358,000 of common stock for treasury and $23,000 related to the relinquishment of shares to pay for withholding taxes on stock issued from our stock compensation plan, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $1,043,000. During 2016, we used $5,964,000 of cash from financing activities to purchase $3,571,000 of common stock for treasury and pay cash dividends of $2,416,000 to common shareholders, partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of $23,000.\n\nIn 2017, we recorded an income tax provision of $3,561,000 at an effective tax rate of 52.6% compared to an income tax provision in 2016 of $1,553,000 at an effective tax rate of 30.0%. The effective tax rate in 2017 was negatively impacted by the passage of the Tax Reform Act that was signed on December 22, 2017. The legislation significantly changes U.S. tax law by, among other things, lowering corporate income tax rates, implementing a territorial tax system and imposing a one-time repatriation tax on undistributed foreign earnings. The Tax Reform Act permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax asset at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1,315,000 charge to income tax expense in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2017. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further details of the impact of the Tax Reform Act.\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities increased $1,053,000, or 35%, due primarily to an increase in our accrued incentive compensation. \nForward Looking Statements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe decrease in domestic revenue from TSG was due to a (1) 38% decrease in sales of replacement parts due mainly to IGT's purchase of an unusually high volume of spare parts for the lottery market in 2015 that did not repeat in 2016, (2) 19% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely from the decline of HP inkjet cartridges, as we continued to deemphasize the commoditized POS and banking consumable products, (3) 18% decline in service revenue, primarily due to project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2015 that did not recur to the same extent in 2016, and (4) 62% decrease of consumables sales for our Printrex color printer due to lower printing usage resulting from reduced drilling activity caused by the decline in worldwide oil prices.\nResource Sufficiency\nSignificant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and, in particular, any valuation allowance or tax reserves with respect to our deferred tax assets and uncertain tax positions. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based upon historical results and forecasted taxable income over future years, and match this forecast against the basis differences, deductions available in future years and the limitations allowed for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards to ensure that there is adequate support for the realization of the deferred tax assets. While we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance, in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance or tax reserves would be charged as a reduction to income in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would be able to realize future deferred tax assets in excess of its net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase net income in the period such determination was made.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we continued to focus our efforts on sales execution and growing the revenue of our newer, value-added products and technologies. During the year we completed the build-out of our direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market. We expect the investments we have made during 2017 to result in increased sales in restaurant solutions as we begin to see significant sales contribution from our two newest products, the AccuDate Pro and AccuDate XL.\n\nInterest. We recorded net interest expense of $33,000 in 2017 compared to $26,000 in 2016.\nInternational lottery sales increased due to sales of lottery printers to IGT for the Canadian lottery in 2017 and no comparable sales occurring in 2016.\nThe increase in Printrex printers was due to an 83% increase in domestic and international sales of our oil and gas printers due to higher demand in 2017 compared to 2016 and a 149% increase in sales of medical and mobile printers primarily due to sales of our mobile printer to one customer. We expect 2018 Printrex sales to be higher than 2017, as we expect a continued modest recovery in the oil and gas market to more than offset lower expected sales of medical and mobile printers as we shift our focus to our higher value, technology-enabled restaurant solution and casino and gaming products.\nWe maintain a credit facility (the \"TD Bank Credit Facility\") with TD Bank N.A. (\"TD Bank) which provides for a $20,000,000 revolving credit line. On November 21, 2017, we signed an amendment to the TD Bank Credit Facility through November 28, 2022. Borrowings under the revolving credit line bear a floating rate of interest at the prime rate minus one percent and are secured by a lien on all of our assets. We also pay a fee of 0.125% on unused borrowings under the revolving credit line. The amendment increased the amount of revolving credit loans we may use to fund future cash dividend payments or treasury share buybacks to $12,500,000 from $10,000,000.\nCasino and gaming: A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\n \u25cf Accounts receivable increased $355,000, or 3% due to a longer than normal collection process related to sales made to our international casino and gaming distributor. \nCasino and gaming: Revenue from the casino and gaming market includes sales of thermal ticket printers used in slot machines, video lottery terminals (\"VLTs\"), and other gaming machines that print tickets or receipts instead of issuing coins (\"ticket-in, ticket-out\" or \"TITO\") at casinos and racetracks and other gaming venues worldwide. Revenue from this market also includes sales of thermal roll-fed printers used in the international off-premise gaming market in gaming machines such as Amusement with Prizes, Skills with Prizes and Fixed Odds Betting Terminals at non-casino gaming establishments. Revenue from this market also includes royalties related to our patented casino and gaming technology. In addition, casino and gaming market revenue includes sales of the EPICENTRALTM print system, our software solution (including annual software maintenance), that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and to print them real-time at the slot machine. A summary of sales of our worldwide casino and gaming products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nShareholders' equity increased $1,905,000 to $26,014,000 at December 31, 2017 from $24,109,000 at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to net income of $3,211,000, as well as $1,014,000 from the issuance of 181,195 shares of common stock related to employee stock awards, net of relinquishments and share-based compensation expense related to stock awards of $609,000. These increases were partially offset by our payment of $2,581,000 in dividends and the purchase of 36,465 shares of treasury stock for $358,000.\n\nTSG: Revenue from TSG includes sales of consumable products (inkjet cartridges, ribbons, receipt paper, color thermal paper, food safety labels and other printing supplies), replacement parts, maintenance and repair services, testing services, refurbished printers, and shipping and handling charges. A summary of sales in our worldwide TSG market for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nThe following accounting policies are those that we believe to be most critical in the preparation of our financial statements. These items utilize assumptions and estimates about the effect of future events that are inherently uncertain and are therefore based on our judgment. Please refer to Note 2 - Summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete listing of our accounting policies.\n \u25cf Deferred income tax provision increased $1,117,000 largely due to a $1,315,000 charge to income tax expense in 2017 to revalue our net deferred tax asset due to the Tax Reform Act. \nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $100,000, or 1%, due primarily to lower incentive compensation costs incurred in 2016 compared to 2015, which was largely offset by higher severance cost related to headcount reductions made during 2016.\nRestaurant solutions: A summary of sales of our worldwide restaurant solutions products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nInternal cash generation together with currently available cash and cash equivalents, available borrowing facilities and an ability to access credit lines, if needed, are expected to be sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, treasury share repurchases, dividend payments and any increase in working capital that would be required to accommodate a higher level of business activity. We actively seek to expand by acquisition as well as through the growth of our current business. While a significant acquisition may require additional debt and/or equity financing, although no assurances can be given, we believe that we would be able to obtain additional financing based on our historical earnings performance.\nNet sales for 2016 decreased $2,441,000, or 4%, from 2015. Although net sales decreased, printer and terminal sales volume increased 3% in 2016 compared to 2015. Our printer and terminal volume increased to approximately 173,000 units, primarily due to 22% increases in both the POS automation and banking and restaurant solutions markets. The average selling price of our printers decreased less than 1% from 2016 to 2015. Overall, international sales decreased $2,253,000, or 16%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international lottery and casino and gaming markets.\nNet Sales. Net sales, which include printer, terminal and software sales as well as sales of replacement parts, consumables and maintenance and repair services, by market for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRevenue, inclusive of software license fees, is generally recognized upon installation and formal acceptance by the customer with the exception of any amount allocated to free maintenance which is deferred and recognized over the initial maintenance period, generally one year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u25cf Accrued liabilities and other liabilities decreased $1,088,000 due primarily to lower accrued incentive compensation costs and deferred revenue in 2016 compared to 2015. \nAccounts Receivable - We have standardized credit granting and review policies and procedures for all customer accounts, including: credit reviews of all new customer accounts; ongoing credit evaluations of current customers; credit limits and payment terms based on available credit information; and adjustments to credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current creditworthiness. We also provide an estimate of doubtful accounts based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues. Our allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2017 was approximately $100,000, or less than 1% of outstanding accounts receivable, which we feel is appropriate considering the overall quality of our accounts receivable. While credit losses have historically been within expectations and the reserves established, we cannot guarantee that our credit loss experience will continue to be consistent with historical experience.\nGross profit decreased $1,179,000, or 5%, due primarily to a 4% decrease in sales. Our gross margin remained relatively consistent, decreasing slightly by 30 basis points compared 2015, to 41.6%.\nInternational sales declined in 2016 due to 28% lower sales of our thermal casino printer in Europe and Asia compared to 2015. The decrease from our thermal casino printers was partially offset by increased off-premises thermal gaming printers and EPICENTRALTM software sales of 38% and 121%, respectively. Sales of our off-premise gaming printers increased due to an expanding market for sports betting in Europe and Australia. However, sales of our off-premise gaming printers are largely project-oriented and therefore may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. The increase in EPICENTRALTM software sales was due to one new international installation completed in 2016 compared to no international installations completed in 2015.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets - We acquire businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with ASC 350-20 \"Goodwill\", acquired goodwill is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing at least annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change, that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Factors considered that may trigger an impairment review are: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; and significant decline in market capitalization relative to net book value. Definite lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when appropriate. We reported $2,621,000 of goodwill and $458,000 of unamortized definite-lived intangible assets at December 31, 2017. We have determined that no goodwill or intangible asset impairment has occurred and the fair value of goodwill was substantially higher than our carrying value based on our assessment as of December 31, 2017 when the impairment review is performed.\nGross Profit. Gross profit information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue. While we expect to increase sales of our lottery printers to other customers, based on our backlog of orders and customer forecasts, we expect lottery printer sales to be lower in 2018 compared to 2017.\nDuring 2016, domestic casino and gaming sales increased 2%, primarily due to a 37% increase in EPICENTRALTM software sales as we completed two domestic installations in 2016 compared to one domestic installation in 2015. Domestic sales of our thermal casino printers during 2016 were consistent with sales in 2015.\nWe believe that our business has not been affected to a significant degree by inflationary trends during the past three years. However, inflation is still a factor in the worldwide economy and may increase the cost of purchasing products from our contract manufacturers in Asia, as well as the cost of certain raw materials, component parts and labor used in the production of our products. It also may increase our operating expenses, manufacturing overhead expenses and the cost to acquire or replace fixed assets. We have generally been able to maintain or improve our profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements, cost reduction programs and to a lesser extent, price increases, and we expect to be able to do the same during 2018. As such, we do not believe that inflation will have a significant impact on our business during 2018.\nOn March 1, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program (the \"2018 Stock Repurchase Program\") substantially similar to the 2016 Stock Repurchase Program, whereby we are authorized to repurchase up to $5,000,000 of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market at prevailing market prices based on market conditions, share price and other factors. The 2018 Stock Repurchase Program expires on December 31, 2019, if we do not discontinue it prior to such time.\nWe reported net income of $3,211,000 and net income per diluted share of $0.42 for 2017, compared to $3,617,000 and net income per diluted share of $0.47 for 2016. In terms of cash flow for 2017, we experienced a very strong year, generating $5,918,000 of cash from operating activities. We also returned $2,939,000 to our shareholders in the form of $358,000 for treasury share repurchases and $2,581,000 for cash dividends and finishing the year with cash and cash equivalents of $5,507,000 and no debt on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2017.\nOur sales to IGT are directly dependent on the timing and number of new and upgraded lottery terminal installations IGT performs, and as a result, may fluctuate significantly quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and are not indicative of IGT's overall business or revenue.\n\nOperating activities: The following significant factors primarily affected our cash provided by operating activities of $5,918,000 in 2017 as compared to $4,624,000 in 2016. During 2017:\nInternational restaurant solutions terminal sales increased in 2016 compared to 2015, due primarily to increased sales to our Latin American distributor.\nThe increase in domestic revenue from TSG was due primarily to a 108% increase in sales of replacement parts and accessories in 2017 compared to 2016 due to higher demand for spare parts in the lottery market in 2017. The increase, to a lesser extent, was also due to a 12% increase in project-oriented testing services that occurred in 2017 but did not occur to the same extent in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-Printrex consumables, largely for legacy POS and banking printers in 2017 compared to 2016. Based on our backlog of orders and contractual commitments from IGT for spare parts for our installed base of lottery printers, we expect TSG sales to decrease in 2018 compared to the unusually high level of IGT spare parts sales in 2017.\nAs disclosed in Note 9 to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements, in June 2012, AD filed a civil complaint against the Company. In connection with this lawsuit, we incurred legal fees and settlement expenses of $0 and $1,738,000 in 2016 and 2015, respectively. The AD lawsuit was settled in March 2015.\n\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flows generated from operating activities will provide sufficient resources to meet our working capital needs, finance our capital expenditures and additions to capitalized software, dividend payments and meet our liquidity requirements through at least the next twelve months.\nThe decrease in domestic restaurant solutions terminal sales in 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily driven by lower sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to our U.S. distributor. This decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our AccuDate 9700 terminal to McDonald's, increased sales of our AccuDate Pro terminal and the initial sales of our AccuDate XL terminal in 2017. We expect sales of our restaurant solutions terminals to increase in 2018 compared to 2017 as we begin to realize the benefits from the strategic selling and marketing investments made during 2017.\nSales of our casino and gaming products decreased 11% in 2017 compared to 2016. In our casino and gaming market, our focus lies primarily in supplying printers worldwide for use in slot machines at casinos and racetracks, as well as in other electronic gaming devices that print tickets or receipts. Additionally, we supplement these printer sales with revenue from EPICENTRALTM, our promotional printing system that enables casino operators to create promotional coupons and marketing messages and print them real time at the slot machine. The decrease of casino and gaming printer sales is primarily due to a 46% decrease in international sales of our off-premise gaming printers and 46% decrease in international sales of the EPIC 950, our thermal casino printer, due to continued sluggishness in Europe, Australia and Asia, including significantly lower sales to our former exclusive worldwide distributor. Effective December 31, 2017, we terminated the relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor and have begun to develop an internal sales team to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. Domestic casino and gaming printer sales increased 22% due mainly to higher sales to our OEMs to support new casino openings and market share gains. Sales of our EPICENTRALTM software decreased 42% as we completed two installations worldwide in 2017 compared to three installations in 2016.\nPOS automation and banking: Revenue from the POS automation and banking market includes sales of thermal and impact printers used primarily by restaurants (including fine dining, casual dining, quick serve and hospitality establishments) located either at the checkout counter or within self-service kiosks to print receipts for consumers or print on linerless labels. In addition, revenue includes sales of inkjet printers used by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions to print deposit or withdrawal receipts and/or validate checks at bank teller stations. A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is as follows:\nOperating Expenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOverall, international sales decreased $4,102,000, or 35%, primarily driven by lower sales in the international casino and gaming market. This decrease was partially offset by a $1 million sales increase in our international lottery market during 2017.\n * International sales do not include sales of products made to domestic distributors or other customers who in turn ship those products to international destinations. \n\nNet Income. We reported net income during 2017 of $3,211,000, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to $3,617,000, or $0.47 per diluted share, for 2016.\nPOS automation and banking: A summary of sales of our worldwide POS automation and banking products for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is as follows:\nDuring 2016:\nEngineering, design and product development expenses increased $826,000 or 23%, due primarily to higher product development costs and the hiring of additional software engineers beginning in early 2016, as we focused and strategically invested in enhancements to our EPICENTRALTM software and expansion of our line of restaurant solutions terminals.\nSelling and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and payroll related expenses for our sales and marketing staff, sales commissions, travel expenses, expenses associated with the lease of sales offices, advertising, trade show expenses, e-commerce and other promotional marketing expenses. Such expenses increased $654,000, or 10%, as we completed the build-out of our internal infrastructure, including the hiring of a direct sales force and implementation of a direct marketing campaign dedicated to the restaurant solutions market in 2017. We expect selling and marketing expenses to be higher in 2018 compared to 2017, as we expect to incur incremental selling and marketing expenses as we have terminated the relationship with our international casino and gaming distributor and we build-out our internal sales infrastructure to begin selling direct to slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe in the first quarter of 2018.\n\nThe increase in both domestic and international POS automation and banking printer revenue in 2016 compared to 2015 was primarily driven by a 38% increase in sales of our Ithaca\u00ae 9000 printer as we continued to supply printers to support new initiatives by McDonald's that started in 2015 and accelerated in 2016. This increase was partially offset by 43% lower sales of our legacy banking and other POS printers in 2016 compared to 2015 as we continued to deemphasize these products.\nThis discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto.\n\nOperating Expenses - Engineering, Design and Product Development. Engineering, design and product development information for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is summarized below (in thousands, except percentages):\nOur operating income increased by $1,614,000, or 31%, primarily due to a 570 basis point improvement in gross margin on a favorable product mix, partially offset by a 7% increase in operating expenses in 2017 compared to 2016.\nIncome Taxes.\nDuring 2017 our cash balance increased $3,004,000, or 120%, from December 31, 2016 and we returned a substantial portion of our cash flow to shareholders in the form of $2,581,000 of cash dividends paid to common shareholders and $358,000 of repurchases of our common stock. Even after funding these items and our capital expenditures, we still ended 2017 with $5,507,000 in cash and cash equivalents, of which $151,000 was held by our U.K. subsidiary, and no debt outstanding.\nDuring 2017, our total net sales decreased 2% to approximately $56,311,000. See the table below for a breakdown of our sales by market:\nOperationally, our gross margin reached 47.3% in 2017, an increase of 570 basis points from 2016, representing the highest gross margin we have reported for a full year. We believe gross margin will continue at these levels in 2018 as our newer, technology-enabled products continue to grow and become a larger portion of our overall sales. In 2017, we achieved operating margin of 12.1% compared to 9.1% in 2016 due to our improved gross margin that was partially offset by higher operating expenses primarily to support our two high growth markets--restaurant solutions and casino and gaming. During 2018, we expect higher operating expenses compared to 2017, as we continue to increase our investments in selling and marketing in these two high growth markets, as we believe these represent TransAct's most significant, long term growth opportunity.\nOther, net. We recorded other expense of $4,000 in 2016 compared to other income of $2,000 in 2015. The change was primarily due to higher foreign currency exchange losses recorded by our U.K. subsidiary in 2016 compared to 2015.\n\nDuring 2018, we plan to strategically invest in our sales and marketing for our European casino and gaming market. Effective December 31, 2017, we terminated the relationship with our worldwide casino and gaming distributor and began building an internal sales team to sell directly to our slot machine manufacturers and end user casino and gaming customers in Europe. As a result of this investment we expect international casino and gaming sales will increase in 2018 compared to 2017. During 2017, sales for our POS automation and banking market decreased as sales to McDonald's began to slow during 2017 compared to the record pace experienced in 2016. We expect sales of our POS automation and banking market to decrease in 2018 as McDonald's completes the implementation of their initiatives which began in 2015 and we shift of our focus toward the restaurant solutions market and casino and gaming market. These decreases were partially offset by increased TSG sales due to higher sales of spare parts in the lottery market in 2017 to IGT compared to 2016.\nOur customers have the right to return products that do not function properly within a limited time after delivery. We monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated future returns based on historical experience. Returns have historically been within expectations and the provisions established, but we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience return rates consistent with historical patterns.\nThe decrease in Printrex printers was primarily due to a 52% decline in domestic and international sales in the oil and gas market due to the continued impact from the decline in worldwide oil prices. In addition, we experienced a 79% decline in medical and mobile printer sales due largely to the loss of a customer in the medical industry and as we shifted our sales focus towards the restaurant solutions market.\nFor EPICENTRALTM and other multiple deliverable arrangements, we consider whether the deliverables in an arrangement are within the scope of existing higher-level generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\") and apply such literature to the extent that it provides guidance regarding whether to separate multiple-deliverable arrangements and how to allocate value among those separate units of accounting. When we enter into a multiple deliverable arrangement, we also determine whether revenue arrangements consist of more than one unit of accounting. At that time, we allocate arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting based on a relative selling price hierarchy, except where amounts allocable to the delivered units is limited to that which is contingent upon the delivery of additional deliverables or meeting other specified performance conditions. The relative selling price for each element is based upon the following selling price hierarchy: vendor specific objective evidence (\"VSOE\") if available, third party evidence (\"TPE\") if VSOE is not available, or best estimate of selling price (\"BESP\") to the extent that VSOE or TPE are not available.", "item_7_tables": "Table 68: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td>

The decrease was primarily due to lower sales in the POS automation and banking market and casino and gaming market, partially offset by increased sales in the restaurant solutions market and TSG market. \n\n- Gross profit increased 12% to $26.7 million and gross margin improved to 47.3% in 2017 compared to 41.6% in 2016 due to a more favorable sales mix.\n\n- Operating expenses increased 7% to $21.1 million primarily due to investments in engineering, design, product development and selling and marketing for the restaurant solutions market and direct sales infrastructure for the casino and gaming market in Europe. \n\n- Operating income increased 16% to $6.8 million due to the improved gross margin, partially offset by higher operating expenses.\n\n- Net income was $3.2 million or $0.42 per diluted share compared to $3.6 million or $0.47 per diluted share in 2016. \n\n- The effective tax rate increased to 52.6% in 2017 compared to 30.0% in 2016 primarily due to a charge of $1.3 million related to the Tax Reform Act.\n\n- Cash flow from operations was $5.9 million in 2017 compared to $4.6 million in 2016. The company paid $2.6 million in dividends and repurchased $0.4 million of stock.\n\n- The company expects sales growth in 2018 driven by restaurant solutions products and expanded direct sales for casino and gaming products in Europe. Higher operating expenses are also expected related to investments in engineering, sales and marketing."}
