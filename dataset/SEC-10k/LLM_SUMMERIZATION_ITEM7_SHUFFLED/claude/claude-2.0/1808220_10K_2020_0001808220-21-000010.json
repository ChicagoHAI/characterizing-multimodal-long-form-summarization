MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section presents management's perspective on our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement data and information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying tables. To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which may not be indicative of our future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Summary Risk Factors\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\nIn certain cases, numbers and percentages in the tables below may not foot due to rounding.\nOverview\nWe are a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company whose mission is to improve access to healthcare in America. Our proprietary technology platform leverages modern machine-learning algorithms powered by nearly two decades of insurance behavioral data to reimagine the optimal process for helping individuals find the best health insurance plan for their specific needs. Our differentiated combination of a vertically-integrated consumer acquisition platform and highly skilled and trained agents has enabled us to enroll millions of people in Medicare and individual and family plans since our inception. With a current commissionable market of nearly $30 billion, and nearly 11,000 Americans turning 65 years old every day and our track record of significant growth in net revenues in the Medicare space in the past five years, we believe we will continue to be one of the top choices for unbiased insurance advice to help navigate one of the most important purchasing decisions individuals make.\nBusiness Segments\nWe have four reportable segments: (i) Medicare-Internal, (ii) Medicare-External, (iii) Individual and Family Plans, or IFP and Other-Internal and (iv) IFP and Other-External. We organize the segments by product type, Medicare and IFP and Other, as well as by distribution channel, internal and external, as further described below. In addition, we separately report other expenses (classified as Corporate expenses\u201d in our financial statements), the primary components of which are corporate overhead expenses and shared service expenses that have not been allocated to the operating segments. The segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies. We refer to the Medicare-Internal and Medicare-External segments collectively as the Medicare segments\u201d and the IFP and Other-Internal and IFP and Other-External segments as the IFP and Other segments.\u201d\n\u2022Medicare-Internal: The Medicare-Internal segment relates to sales of products and plans by GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans from multiple carriers, GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans on a carrier-specific basis, or sales of products and plans through our online platform without the assistance of our agents, which we refer to as DIY. In this segment, we sell Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare prescription drug plans, and Medicare Special Needs Plans, or SNPs. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers based on sales we generated, as well as enrollment fees, hourly fees and other fees for services performed for specific carriers and other partners. The Medicare-Internal segment is our largest and fastest growing segment, and represented 96% of segment profits in 2020.\n\u2022Medicare-External: The Medicare-External segment relates to sales of products and plans under GoHealth's carrier contracts using an independent, national network of agents or external agencies, which are not employed by GoHealth. These agents utilize our technology and platform to enroll consumers in health insurance plans and provide us with a means to earn a return on leads that otherwise may have not been addressed. In this segment, we sell Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare prescription drug plans, and SNPs. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers as a result of policy sales, as well as sales of consumer leads to external agencies.\n\u2022IFP and Other-Internal: The IFP and Other-Internal segment relates to sales of products and plans by GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans from multiple carriers, GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans on a carrier-specific basis, or DIY. In this segment, we sell individual and family plans, dental plans, vision plans and other ancillary plans to individuals who are not Medicare-eligible. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers based on sales we generate, as well as enrollment fees, and hourly fees and other fees for services performed for specific carriers and other partners.\n\u2022IFP and Other-External: The IFP and Other-External segment relates to sales of products and plans under GoHealth's carrier contracts using external agencies, who use agents that are not employed by GoHealth. These agents utilize our technology and platform to enroll consumers in health insurance plans. We also sell consumer leads\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 53\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ngenerated by us to external agencies. In this segment, we sell individual and family plans, dental plans, vision plans and other ancillary plans to individuals who are not Medicare-eligible. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers as a result of policy sales, as well as sales of consumer leads to external agencies.\nThe following table presents the percentages of revenues and profit (loss) generated by each of our operating segments for the periods presented:\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Successor </td> <td> </td> <td>Predecessor </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Sep. 13, 2019 through Dec. 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Jan. 1, 2019 through Sep. 12, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of net revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare-Internal </td> <td> </td> <td>76.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>69.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare-External </td> <td> </td> <td>17.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFP and Other-Internal </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFP and Other-External </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent of segment profit: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare-Internal </td> <td> </td> <td>96.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>90.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>81.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare-External </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFP and Other-Internal </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>21.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IFP and Other-External </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total segment profit </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Transactions\nOur historical results of operations prior to the completion of the Transactions, including the IPO, do not reflect certain items that we expect will affect our results of operations and financial condition after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds from the IPO.\nFollowing the completion of the Transactions, GoHealth, Inc. became the sole managing member of GoHealth Holdings, LLC. Although we have a minority economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, we have the sole voting interest in, and control of the business and affairs of, GoHealth Holdings, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a result, GoHealth, Inc. consolidates GoHealth Holdings, LLC and records significant non-controlling interest in a consolidated entity in GoHealth, Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements for the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC held directly or indirectly by the Continuing Equity Owners. As of December 31, 2020, public investors collectively own 51.7% of our outstanding Class A common stock, consisting of 43,513 shares of Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2020, GoHealth, Inc. owns 84,195 LLC Interests, representing 26.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, the Founders collectively own 97,301 LLC Interests, representing 30.9% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, Centerbridge owns 80,793 LLC Interests, representing 25.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, and the Continuing Equity Owners collectively own 52,639 LLC Interests, representing 16.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC held by non-controlling interest was 73.3%. GoHealth, Inc. is a holding company that conducts no operations and its principal asset is the LLC Interests we purchased from GoHealth Holdings, LLC.\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 54\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe percentage ownership of total shares of Class A and Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:\nGoHealth, Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of GoHealth Holdings, LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our status as a public company, plus payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be significant. We intend to cause GoHealth Holdings, LLC to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay these expenses and fund any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nResponse to COVID-19\nWith social distancing measures having been implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19, we successfully transitioned our agents and other employees to a work from home working environment. We believe the investments we have made in our technology infrastructure have allowed for a seamless transition to a remote working environment without any material impacts to our business, highlighting its resilience. We believe that our business is well-suited to navigate the current environment in which consumers are particularly focused on healthcare issues and mortality. While social distancing requirements have pushed consumers to conduct business remotely, the underlying demand dynamics for our core products remain unchanged. Additionally, because of our remote agent platform, we believe agents will continue to be attracted to our bonus-based agent compensation model and the stable and attractive source of income it can provide, thereby allowing us to continue to recruit and retain agents. Further, as consumers become more comfortable with conducting business remotely, we believe consumer adoption of distribution models such as ours may continue to accelerate long after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have fully transitioned our existing agents in Chicago, Salt Lake City and Charlotte to work from home, and have since opened four new virtual sites in Tampa, Columbus, Phoenix and Dallas. These locations were selected because of the depth of available licensed sales talent and our ability to work closely with state regulators and their vendors to expedite the licensing process for new agents and resolve delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThere are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a global pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nTable 70: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 55\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of changes in the financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019.

presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate its business and monitor its results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for share-based compensation, expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards, change in fair value of contingent consideration liability, Centerbridge Acquisition costs, severance costs and one time indirect costs in connection with the IPO. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 56\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nmeasures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), are presented in the tables below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items and include other expenses, costs and non-recurring items.\nThe following table sets

$175.8 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $252.0 million, or 60.1%, increase was primarily attributable to increases in commission revenue from (i) the Medicare-Internal segment driven by a 87% increase in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions due to the hiring of additional agents, the increased utilization and efficiency of our agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to generate a greater number of qualified prospects and (ii) the Medicare-External segment driven by a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 57\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEnterprise Revenues\nEnterprise revenues were $206.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $65.1 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $55.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $85.9 million, or 71.4%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $108.3 million related to partner marketing and enrollment services, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in direct partner campaigns in our Medicare-Internal segment and a $18.4 million decrease in consumer lead sales to external third parties in our external segments, as we strategically shifted to generating consumer leads in the internal channels.\nOperating Expense\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue was $199.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $90.4 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $79.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $29.6 million, or 17.5%, increase was primarily attributable to a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions in the Medicare-External segment, which increased the amount of expense we recognized pursuant to our revenue-sharing agreements with external agents and other partners.\nMarketing and Advertising\nMarketing and advertising expense was $206.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $24.8 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $37.8 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $144.3 million, or 230.6%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our advertising costs for the Medicare-Internal segment to generate more qualified prospects, which contributed to a 87% increase in Medicare-Internal commissionable Approved Submissions. Additionally, marketing and advertising expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $24.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO.\nCustomer Care and Enrollment\nCustomer care and enrollment expense was $165.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $44.4 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $49.1 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $72.0 million, or 77.0%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional agents in the Medicare-Internal segment in order to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions. Additionally, customer care and enrollment expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $11.5 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO.\nOur agent base increased approximately 60% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nTechnology\nTechnology expense was $59.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $6.0 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.3 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $13.0 million, or 28.1%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional employees in our technology and data science teams, and the expansion of our business intelligence and analytics staffing in order to support the growth of the Medicare-Internal segment. Technology expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $32.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO. The Predecessor 2019 Period included share-based compensation expense of $27.1 million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain legacy profit interests and legacy incentive share units granted prior to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense was $197.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.7 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $79.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $104.3 million, or 112.3%, increase was primarily attributable to investments in corporate infrastructure, such as legal, human resources, and finance, to support general growth and implement the corporate resources needed to support a post-IPO business. General and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $140.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO. General and administrative expense for the Predecessor 2019 Period included share-based compensation expense of $58.3 million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain legacy profit interests and legacy incentive share units granted prior to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 58\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liability\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liability was $19.7 million and $70.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and Successor 2019 Period, respectively, and relates to the earnout liability incurred in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, in which we agreed to pay additional consideration if certain financial targets are achieved. We had no earnout liability for the Predecessor 2019 Period.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets expense was $94.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $28.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and no amortization of intangible assets expense for the Predecessor 2019 Period, and relates to the amortization of developed technology and customer relationships that were recognized as part of the purchase price allocation at the date of the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $33.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8.1 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $0.1 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $24.8 million increase was due to additional debt outstanding on our Credit Facilities.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA was $271.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $130.5 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $100.6 million, or 59.0%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase in commission revenues in the Medicare segments as described above.\nSegment Information\nOur operating segments have been determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 280, Segment Reporting. We have four operating segments: Medicare-Internal, Medicare-External, IFP and Other-Internal, and IFP and Other-External. In addition, we separately report other expenses (classified as Corporate expense\u201d in the following table), the primary components of which are corporate overhead expenses and shared service expenses that have not been allocated to the operating segments, as they are not the responsibility of segment operating management. The segment measurements provided to and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The period from January 1, 2019 through September 12, 2019 includes the Class C share-based compensation and incentive share plan expense recorded in connection with the Acquisition, and which totaled $87.1 million.\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues for the Medicare-Internal segment were $667.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $215.3 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $102.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $349.8 million, or 110.2%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional agents, the increased utilization and efficiency of our agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to generate a greater number of qualified prospects, which contributed to a 87% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions. Our agent base increased approximately 60% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nNet revenues for the Medicare-External segment were $155.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $59.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $56.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $40.5 million, or 35.2%, increase was primarily attributable to a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions in the Medicare-External segment due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\nNet revenues for the IFP and Other-Internal segment were $32.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $20.9 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $37.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. Net revenues for the IFP and Other-External segment were $22.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $34.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. For each of the IFP and Other segments, the decreases were primarily driven by a change in product mix sold, as well as a strategic shift towards Medicare products.\nSegment Profit\nSegment profit for the Medicare-Internal segment was $296.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $126.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $130.6 million, or 78.6%, increase was primarily attributable to the 87% increase of Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions, which was primarily attributable to (i) improvements in our LeadScore and call-routing technologies allowing our agents to successfully convert more qualified prospects into Submitted Policies and (ii) improved marketing efficiencies driven by our rapid\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 60\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\ntest-and-learn approach across our marketing channels, as well as an expansion of the diversity and breadth of our omnichannel marketing efforts, which together enabled the acquisition of higher quality prospects.\nSegment profit for the Medicare-External segment was $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $10.6 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $4.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $9.5 million, or 61.6%, decrease was primarily attributable to agreements with external agents and other partners that had a higher revenue-sharing percentage as compared to prior agreements, which ultimately increased the amount of expense we recognized pursuant to these revenue-sharing agreements.\nSegment profit for the IFP and Other-Internal segment was $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.7 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $2.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $0.4 million, or 11.0%, increase was primarily attributable to a change in product mix sold by agents for IFP and Other plans, as well as an overall strategic shift towards Medicare products.\nSegment profit for the IFP and Other-External segment was $1.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.6 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $1.7 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $0.4 million, or 18.1%, decrease was primarily attributable to a change in product mix sold by external agencies, as well as an overall strategic shift towards Medicare products.\nKey Business and Operating Metrics by Segment\nIn addition to traditional financial metrics, we rely upon certain business and operating metrics to evaluate our business performance and facilitate our operations. Below are the most relevant business and operating metrics for each segment, except for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are not presented on a segment basis.\nMedicare Segments\nLifetime Value of Commissions per Consumer Acquisition Cost\nLifetime value of commissions per consumer acquisition cost, or LTV/CAC, represents (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, or LTV, divided by (ii) the cost to convert a qualified prospect into a Submitted Policy (comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses) less other non-commission carrier revenue for such period, or CAC. CAC is comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses less enterprise revenue and is presented on a per commissionable Approved Submission basis. The estimate of the future renewal commissions is determined by using the contracted renewal commission rates constrained by a persistency-adjusted renewal period. The persistency-adjusted renewal period is determined based on our historical experience and available industry and insurance carrier historical data. Persistency-adjustments allow us to estimate renewal revenue only to the extent probable that a material reversal in revenue would not be expected to occur. These factors may result in varying values from period to period. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our operating results may be adversely impacted by factors that impact our estimate of LTV\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe LTV/CAC for the Medicare-Internal segment was 3.0x (with a CAC of $162.2 million) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 5.1x (with a CAC of $32.5 million) for the Successor 2019 Period and 2.7x (with a CAC of $30.7 million) for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The decrease in LTV/CAC is attributable to the hiring and training of additional agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions, which increased 87% year over year in the Medicare-Internal segment.\nSubmitted Policies\nSubmitted Policies represent completed applications that, with respect to each such application, the consumer has authorized us to submit to the carrier. The applicant may need to take additional actions, including providing subsequent information before the application is reviewed by the carrier.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 61\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents the number of Submitted Policies by product for the Medicare segments for the periods presented, split between those submissions that are commissionable (compensated through commissions received from carriers) and those that are non-commissionable (compensated via hourly fees and enrollment fees):\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Successor </td> <td> </td> <td>Predecessor </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in actuals) </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Sep. 13, 2019 through Dec. 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Jan. 1, 2019 through Sep. 12, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Advantage </td> <td> </td> <td>644,669 </td> <td> </td> <td>222,599 </td> <td> </td> <td>134,173 </td> <td> </td> <td>91,314 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Supplement </td> <td> </td> <td>9,119 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,444 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,205 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,606 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prescription Drug Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>16,762 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,838 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,675 </td> <td> </td> <td>12,617 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Medicare-Commissionable </td> <td> </td> <td>670,550 </td> <td> </td> <td>243,881 </td> <td> </td> <td>153,053 </td> <td> </td> <td>115,537 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Advantage </td> <td> </td> <td>44,799 </td> <td> </td> <td>17,775 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,240 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,172 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Supplement </td> <td> </td> <td>8,782 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,185 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,051 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,340 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prescription Drug Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>5,781 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,041 </td> <td> </td> <td>471 </td> <td> </td> <td>327 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Medicare-Non-commissionable </td> <td> </td> <td>59,362 </td> <td> </td> <td>25,001 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,762 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,839 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Medicare Submitted Policies </td> <td> </td> <td>729,912 </td> <td> </td> <td>268,882 </td> <td> </td> <td>158,815 </td> <td> </td> <td>118,376 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Medicare Submitted Policies were 729,912 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 268,882 for the Successor 2019 Period and 158,815 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is attributable to improved multichannel marketing strategies that allowed us to generate a greater number of high quality prospects, along with increased efficiency of our agents. Agent efficiency increased due to the implementation of more efficient marketing strategies and improvements in our LeadScore and call-routing technologies, which allowed our agents to increase the number of qualified prospects they are able to talk to and improve the rate at which a qualified prospect converts to a Submitted Policy. Additionally, the successful hiring, onboarding, and training of additional agents contributed to the increase in Submitted Policies. We were also able to drive an increase in total Submitted Policies in the Medicare-External segment due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\nApproved Submissions\nApproved Submissions represent Submitted Policies approved by carriers for the identified product during the indicated period. Not all Approved Submissions will go in force, as some individuals we enroll may not ultimately pay their insurance premiums or may switch out of a policy within the disenrollment period during the first 90 days of the policy. In general, the relationship between Submitted Policies and Approved Submissions has been steady over time. Therefore, factors impacting the number of Submitted Policies also impact the number of Approved Submissions.\nThe following tables present the number of Approved Submissions by product relating to commissionable policies for each of the Medicare segments for the periods presented. Only commissionable policies are used to calculate our LTV.\nMedicare-Internal\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Successor </td> <td> </td> <td>Predecessor </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in actuals) </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Sep. 13, 2019 through Dec. 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Jan. 1, 2019 through Sep. 12, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Advantage </td> <td> </td> <td>478,863 </td> <td> </td> <td>159,969 </td> <td> </td> <td>86,544 </td> <td> </td> <td>45,876 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Supplement </td> <td> </td> <td>3,116 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,852 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,198 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,753 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prescription Drug Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>13,582 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,943 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,078 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,115 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Medicare-Internal Commissionable Approved Submissions </td> <td> </td> <td>495,561 </td> <td> </td> <td>170,764 </td> <td> </td> <td>94,820 </td> <td> </td> <td>57,744 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMedicare-Internal commissionable Approved Submissions were 495,561 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 170,764 for the Successor 2019 Period and 94,820 for the Predecessor 2019 Period.

The increase in Medicare-External commissionable Approved Submissions was attributable to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans.\nLifetime Value of Commissions Per Approved Submission\nLifetime value of commissions per commissionable Approved Submission, or LTV per Approved Submission, represents (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, divided by (ii) the number of commissionable Approved Submissions for such period. LTV per Approved Submission is equal to the sum of the commission revenue due upon the initial sale of a policy, and when applicable, an estimate of future renewal commissions per commissionable Approved Submissions. The estimate of the future renewal commissions is determined by using the contracted renewal commission rates constrained by a persistency-adjusted renewal period. The persistency-adjusted renewal period is determined based on our historical experience and available industry and carrier historical data. Persistency-adjustments allow us to estimate renewal revenue only to the extent probable that a material reversal in revenue would not be expected to occur. These factors may result in varying values from period to period. LTV per Approved Submission represents commissions only from policies sold during the period, but excludes policies originally submitted in prior periods.\nThe following table presents the LTV per Approved Submission by product for the Medicare segments for the periods presented:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Successor </td> <td> </td> <td>Predecessor </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in actuals) </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Sep. 13, 2019 through Dec. 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Jan. 1, 2019 through Sep. 12, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Advantage </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>936 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medicare Supplement </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>936 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>911 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>798 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Prescription Drug Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLTV per Approved Submission for Medicare Advantage was $995 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $1,018 for the Successor 2019 Period and $888 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is due to an increase in CMS-approved commission rates and a more diverse carrier base, allowing us to offer more products and plans that contributed to more long-term customer satisfaction.\nLTV per Approved Submission for Medicare Supplement was $849 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $936 for the Successor 2019 Period and $911 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The decrease is primarily due to changes in carrier mix.\nLTV per Approved Submission for prescription drug plans was $215 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $213 for the Successor 2019 Period and $194 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is primarily due to an increase in CMS-approved commission rates.\nIFP and Other Segments\nSubmitted Policies\nSubmitted Policies represent the number of completed applications that, with respect to each such application, the consumer has authorized us to submit to the carrier. The applicant may need to take additional actions, including providing subsequent information before the application is reviewed by the carrier.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 63\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Submitted Policies for the IFP and Other segments were 120,674 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 146,228 for the Successor 2019 Period, 150,544 for the Predecessor 2019 Period and 207,695 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is due to a change in strategy to prioritize agents and marketing and advertising spend in the Medicare segments instead of the IFP and Other segments.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nOur liquidity needs primarily include working capital and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $144.2 million. On July 17, 2020, we completed our IPO, which resulted in the issuance and sale of 43,500 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $21.00, and generating net proceeds of $852.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs. We believe that our current sources of liquidity, which include cash and cash equivalents and funds available under the Credit Facilities, as described further below, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months. Short-term liquidity needs will primarily be funded through the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility, as described further below, if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility and had a remaining capacity of $58.0 million. To the extent that our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds, which may include the sale of equity securities or through debt financing arrangements. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and any future instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that could restrict our operations.\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Successor 2019 Period, the Predecessor 2019 Period and the twelve months ended December 31, 2018:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Successor </td> <td> </td> <td>Predecessor </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Sep. 13, 2019 through Dec. 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from Jan. 1, 2019 through Sep. 12, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve months ended Dec. 31, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(114,217) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,284) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,523) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(810,010) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,597) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,170) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>260,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>830,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,449) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including share-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; amortization of intangible assets; change in the fair value of contingent consideration; and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nCollection of commissions receivable depends upon the timing of the receipt of commission payments. If there were to be a delay in receiving a commission payment from a carrier within a quarter, the operating cash flows for that quarter could be adversely impacted.\nA significant portion of marketing and advertising expense is driven by the number of qualified prospects required to generate the insurance applications submitted to carriers. Marketing and advertising costs are expensed and generally paid as incurred and since commission revenue is recognized upon approval of a submission but commission payments are paid to us over time, there are working capital requirements to fund the upfront cost of acquiring new policies.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $114.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of a $97.2 million net loss and positive adjustments for non-cash items of $335.2 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $352.2 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in commissions receivable of $427.5 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $24.0 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase in commissions payable of $107.6 million. The increases in commissions receivable and commissions payable were each driven by increases in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $9.3 million for the Successor 2019 Period, which consisted of $16.0 million in net income and adjustments for non-cash items of $100.8 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $126.1 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in commissions receivable of $204.0 million partially offset by an increase in commissions payables of $80.8 million, which were each driven by an increase in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 64\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.3 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period and primarily consisted of $57.1 million in net loss and adjustments for non-cash items of $91.5 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $25.1 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by commissions receivable of $63.4 million, offset by increases in commissions payables of $19.2 million, which were each driven by increases in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities was $14.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and consisted of capitalized internal-use software related to new technology, software, and systems and purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $810.0 million for the Successor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to the Centerbridge Acquisition, which comprised $807.6 million of net cash used in investing activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $5.6 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to capitalized internal-use software related to new technology, software, and systems.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $260.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock sold in the IPO, net of offering costs, of $852.4 million. Of the $852.4 million of IPO proceeds, $508.3 million was used to purchase LLC Interests, $100.0 million was used to settle the Senior Preferred Earnout Units, and $96.2 million was used as partial consideration for the Blocker Merger. Additionally, the Company made borrowings of $117.0 million under the Incremental Term Loan Facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $830.9 million for the Successor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to the issuance of preferred units in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, which comprised $541.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which compromised $300.0 million of net cash provided by financing activities, and was partially offset by payments of existing debt, capital lease obligations and debt issuance costs.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $3.4 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period was due to borrowings under our predecessor revolving credit facility of $56.5 million, which was offset by the repayment of such borrowings (and related expenses in relation thereto) in the amount of $59.9 million, as well as payments of our capital lease obligations.\nCredit Facilities\nOn September 13, 2019, in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, Norvax entered into a first lien credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) which provides for a (i) $300.0 million aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) $30.0 million aggregate principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nOn March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $117.0 million of incremental term loans (the Incremental Term Loan Facility\u201d).\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $20.0 million of incremental revolving credit, (the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $8.0 million of incremental revolving credit, (the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nWe collectively refer to the Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Incremental Term Loan Facility, the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility, and the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility as the Credit Facilities\u201d.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had principal amounts totaling $412.4 million, consisting of $296.3 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $116.1 million outstanding under the Incremental Term Loan Facility (collectively the Aggregate Term Loan Facility\u201d). We had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility, or the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility (collectively the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility had a remaining capacity of $58.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\nOur material contractual obligations generally include operating leases and capital leases, and long-term debt.

As a result, we experience an increase in the number of submitted Medicare-related applications during the fourth quarter and an increase in expense related to the Medicare segments during the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, as a result of the annual Medicare Advantage open enrollment period that occurs from January 1st to March 31st, commission revenue is typically second-highest in our first quarter. The second and third quarters are known as special election periods, and are our seasonally smallest quarters. A significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses is driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted through us. Marketing and advertising expenses are generally higher in the fourth quarter during the Medicare annual enrollment period, but because commissions from approved customers are paid to us over time, our operating cash flows could be adversely impacted by a substantial increase in marketing and advertising expenses as a result of a higher volume of applications submitted during the fourth quarter or positively impacted by a substantial decline in marketing and advertising expenses as a result of lower volume of applications submitted during the fourth quarter.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We regularly assess these estimates; however, actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The impact of changes in estimates is recorded in the period in which they become known.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance. The accounting policies we believe to reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions that are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are:\n\u2022Revenue recognition and commissions receivable;\n\u2022Share-based compensation;\n\u2022Goodwill and intangible assets;\n\u2022Income taxes; and\n\u2022Liabilities pursuant to tax receivable agreements ( TRAs\u201d).\nRevenue Recognition and Commissions Receivable\nIn accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period, material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result. The accounting estimates and judgments related to the recognition of revenue require us to make assumptions about numerous factors, such as the determination of performance obligations and determination of the transaction price. The estimate of renewal commissions are considered variable consideration in the transaction price and requires significant judgment including determining the number of periods in which a renewal will occur and the value of those renewal commissions to be received if renewed. We utilize the expected value approach to do this, incorporating a combination of historical lapse and premium increase data, available industry and carrier experience data, historical payment data by segment and carrier, as well as current forecast data to estimate forecasted renewal considerations and then to constrain revenue recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved when the policy renews, and any adjustments in variable consideration are recognized in the period incurred.\nCommissions receivable includes the variable consideration for policies that may renew, and therefore, are subject to the same assumptions, judgments and estimates used when recognizing revenue as noted above.\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 66\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards, including Profit Units, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and stock options, based on the estimated grant date fair value of awards. Share-based compensation expense for Time-Vesting Units, RSUs and stock options are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally three to five years.\nEffective September 13, 2019 and in conjunction with the Centerbridge Acquisition, the Company authorized the grants of non-voting Profit Units. Profit Units consist of both Time-Vesting Units and Performance-Vesting Units and their fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Embedded in the simulation are several assumptions, including the expected life of the award based on estimates of the timing of a liquidity event, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility. The Time-Vesting Units' expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over a five year vesting period. The Performance-Vesting Units' expense is recognized upon a liquidity event based on certain predetermined criteria. Upon completion of our IPO, the implied performance condition was satisfied, triggering an accelerated vesting and related compensation expense of $209.3 million in the third quarter of 2020.\nIn connection with the IPO, we granted RSUs and stock options to employees and non-employee directors. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is calculated using a Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. Embedded in the pricing model are several assumptions, including the expected life of the award, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility. The assumptions we use represent management's best estimates. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our compensation expense for stock options could be materially different for future grants. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years for RSUs and three to four years for stock options. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized.\nWhen determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as goodwill, are not amortized.\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, cost considerations, our financial performance, events specific to our company, industry or reporting unit, and other relevant events. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\nPerforming a quantitative impairment test for goodwill includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, cash flow projections and selecting an appropriate discount rate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been recognized.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determination of fair value involves significant estimates and assumptions including, among others, cash flow projections and selecting appropriate royalty and discount rates.\nIntangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicators of impairment are determined to exist. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from their use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 67\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no impairment has been recognized for either indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible assets.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish liabilities for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Our liabilities reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change.\nLiabilities Pursuant to TRAs\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with GHH, LLC, the Continuing Equity Owners and the Blocker Shareholders that will provide for the payment by the Company to the Continuing Equity Owners and the Blocker Shareholders of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that the Company actually realizes (or in some circumstances is deemed to realize) as a result of (1) the Company's allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the Transactions (including the Blocker Company's share of existing tax basis) and increases to such allocable share of existing tax basis; (2) increases in tax basis resulting from (a) the Company's purchase of LLC Interests directly from GHH, LLC and the partial redemption of LLC Interests by GHH, LLC, (b) future redemptions or exchanges (or deemed exchanges in certain circumstances) of LLC Interests for Class A common stock or cash, and (c) certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by GHH, LLC; and (3) certain additional tax benefits arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Company may benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that the Company actually realizes.\nThe amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income of the Company in the future. In projecting future taxable income, the Company considers its historical results and incorporates certain assumptions, including revenue growth and operating margins, among others. The projection of future taxable income involves judgement and actual taxable income may differ from our estimates, which could impact the timing of payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If the Company determines that it will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the related tax benefits, the Company would reduce the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability related to the tax benefits not expected to be utilized through earnings at that time.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has determined there is no resulting liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement arising from the Transactions. Should the Company determine that the Tax Receivable Agreement liability is considered probable at a future date based on new information, any changes will be recorded within earnings at that time.\nJOBS Act\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our Consolidated Financial Statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nWe have elected the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company we are not required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor's attestation report on our systems of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (3) comply with the requirement of the PCAOB regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor's report on the financial statements and (4) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoHealth, Inc. </td> <td>2020 Form 10-K </td> <td> 68\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n$700.0 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt over a rolling 36-month period.", "item_7_truncated": "Adjusted EBITDA was $271.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $130.5 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period.

The $349.8 million, or 110.2%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional agents, the increased utilization and efficiency of our agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to generate a greater number of qualified prospects, which contributed to a 87% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions.

Our proprietary technology platform leverages modern machine-learning algorithms powered by nearly two decades of insurance behavioral data to reimagine the optimal process for helping individuals find the best health insurance plan for their specific needs. Our differentiated combination of a vertically-integrated consumer acquisition platform and highly skilled and trained agents has enabled us to enroll millions of people in Medicare and individual and family plans since our inception. With a current commissionable market of nearly $30 billion, and nearly 11,000 Americans turning 65 years old every day and our track record of significant growth in net revenues in the Medicare space in the past five years, we believe we will continue to be one of the top choices for unbiased insurance advice to help navigate one of the most important purchasing decisions individuals make.\nMedicare Segments\nLTV per Approved Submission for Medicare Supplement was $849 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $936 for the Successor 2019 Period and $911 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The decrease is primarily due to changes in carrier mix.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial\n\u2022Liabilities pursuant to tax receivable agreements ( TRAs\u201d).\nNet revenues for the IFP and Other-Internal segment were $32.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $20.9 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $37.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. Net revenues for the IFP and Other-External segment were $22.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $34.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. For each of the IFP and Other segments, the decreases were primarily driven by a change in product mix sold, as well as a strategic shift towards Medicare products.\nOur historical results of operations prior to the completion of the Transactions, including the IPO, do not reflect certain items that we expect will affect our results of operations and financial condition after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds from the IPO.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have four reportable segments: (i) Medicare-Internal, (ii) Medicare-External, (iii) Individual and Family Plans, or IFP and Other-Internal and (iv) IFP and Other-External. We organize the segments by product type, Medicare and IFP and Other, as well as by distribution channel, internal and external, as further described below. In addition, we separately report other expenses (classified as Corporate expenses\u201d in our financial statements), the primary components of which are corporate overhead expenses and shared service expenses that have not been allocated to the operating segments. The segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies. We refer to the Medicare-Internal and Medicare-External segments collectively as the Medicare segments\u201d and the IFP and Other-Internal and IFP and Other-External segments as the IFP and Other segments.\u201d\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFollowing the completion of the Transactions, GoHealth, Inc. became the sole managing member of GoHealth Holdings, LLC. Although we have a minority economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, we have the sole voting interest in, and control of the business and affairs of, GoHealth Holdings, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a result, GoHealth, Inc. consolidates GoHealth Holdings, LLC and records significant non-controlling interest in a consolidated entity in GoHealth, Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements for the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC held directly or indirectly by the Continuing Equity Owners. As of December 31, 2020, public investors collectively own 51.7% of our outstanding Class A common stock, consisting of 43,513 shares of Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2020, GoHealth, Inc. owns 84,195 LLC Interests, representing 26.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, the Founders collectively own 97,301 LLC Interests, representing 30.9% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, Centerbridge owns 80,793 LLC Interests, representing 25.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, and the Continuing Equity Owners collectively own 52,639 LLC Interests, representing 16.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC held by non-controlling interest was 73.3%. GoHealth, Inc. is a holding company that conducts no operations and its principal asset is the LLC Interests we purchased from GoHealth Holdings, LLC.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.9 % 42.3 % 17.3 % 15.4 % \nAs of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been recognized.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $8.0 million of incremental revolving credit, (the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 54 \nWhen determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as goodwill, are not amortized.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, cost considerations, our financial performance, events specific to our company, industry or reporting unit, and other relevant events. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\nOur liquidity needs primarily include working capital and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $144.2 million. On July 17, 2020, we completed our IPO, which resulted in the issuance and sale of 43,500 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $21.00, and generating net proceeds of $852.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs. We believe that our current sources of liquidity, which include cash and cash equivalents and funds available under the Credit Facilities, as described further below, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months. Short-term liquidity needs will primarily be funded through the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility, as described further below, if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility and had a remaining capacity of $58.0 million. To the extent that our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds, which may include the sale of equity securities or through debt financing arrangements. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and any future instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that could restrict our operations.\nDuring the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no impairment has been recognized for either indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible assets.\n\u2022Income taxes; and\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have fully transitioned our existing agents in Chicago, Salt Lake City and Charlotte to work from home, and have since opened four new virtual sites in Tampa, Columbus, Phoenix and Dallas. These locations were selected because of the depth of available licensed sales talent and our ability to work closely with state regulators and their vendors to expedite the licensing process for new agents and resolve delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment profit for the Medicare-Internal segment was $296.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $126.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $130.6 million, or 78.6%, increase was primarily attributable to the 87% increase of Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions, which was primarily attributable to (i) improvements in our LeadScore and call-routing technologies allowing our agents to successfully convert more qualified prospects into Submitted Policies and (ii) improved marketing efficiencies driven by our rapid\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u2022IFP and Other-External: The IFP and Other-External segment relates to sales of products and plans under GoHealth's carrier contracts using external agencies, who use agents that are not employed by GoHealth. These agents utilize our technology and platform to enroll consumers in health insurance plans. We also sell consumer leads\nLifetime value of commissions per commissionable Approved Submission, or LTV per Approved Submission, represents (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, divided by (ii) the number of commissionable Approved Submissions for such period. LTV per Approved Submission is equal to the sum of the commission revenue due upon the initial sale of a policy, and when applicable, an estimate of future renewal commissions per commissionable Approved Submissions. The estimate of the future renewal commissions is determined by using the contracted renewal commission rates constrained by a persistency-adjusted renewal period. The persistency-adjusted renewal period is determined based on our historical experience and available industry and carrier historical data. Persistency-adjustments allow us to estimate renewal revenue only to the extent probable that a material reversal in revenue would not be expected to occur. These factors may result in varying values from period to period. LTV per Approved Submission represents commissions only from policies sold during the period, but excludes policies originally submitted in prior periods.\nEnterprise revenues were $206.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $65.1 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $55.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $85.9 million, or 71.4%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $108.3 million related to partner marketing and enrollment services, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in direct partner campaigns in our Medicare-Internal segment and a $18.4 million decrease in consumer lead sales to external third parties in our external segments, as we strategically shifted to generating consumer leads in the internal channels.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 55 \nThe amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income of the Company in the future. In projecting future taxable income, the Company considers its historical results and incorporates certain assumptions, including revenue growth and operating margins, among others. The projection of future taxable income involves judgement and actual taxable income may differ from our estimates, which could impact the timing of payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If the Company determines that it will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the related tax benefits, the Company would reduce the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability related to the tax benefits not expected to be utilized through earnings at that time.\nCredit Facilities\nGeneral and administrative expense was $197.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.7 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $79.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $104.3 million, or 112.3%, increase was primarily attributable to investments in corporate infrastructure, such as legal, human resources, and finance, to support general growth and implement the corporate resources needed to support a post-IPO business. General and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $140.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO. General and administrative expense for the Predecessor 2019 Period included share-based compensation expense of $58.3 million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain legacy profit interests and legacy incentive share units granted prior to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nNet revenues for the Medicare-External segment were $155.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $59.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $56.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $40.5 million, or 35.2%, increase was primarily attributable to a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions in the Medicare-External segment due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with GHH, LLC, the Continuing Equity Owners and the Blocker Shareholders that will provide for the payment by the Company to the Continuing Equity Owners and the Blocker Shareholders of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that the Company actually realizes (or in some circumstances is deemed to realize) as a result of (1) the Company's allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the Transactions (including the Blocker Company's share of existing tax basis) and increases to such allocable share of existing tax basis; (2) increases in tax basis resulting from (a) the Company's purchase of LLC Interests directly from GHH, LLC and the partial redemption of LLC Interests by GHH, LLC, (b) future redemptions or exchanges (or deemed exchanges in certain circumstances) of LLC Interests for Class A common stock or cash, and (c) certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by GHH, LLC; and (3) certain additional tax benefits arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Company may benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that the Company actually realizes.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 53 \nThis section presents management's perspective on our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement data and information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying tables. To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which may not be indicative of our future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Summary Risk Factors\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\n\u2022Revenue recognition and commissions receivable;\n\nTechnology\nLifetime value of commissions per consumer acquisition cost, or LTV/CAC, represents (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, or LTV, divided by (ii) the cost to convert a qualified prospect into a Submitted Policy (comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses) less other non-commission carrier revenue for such period, or CAC. CAC is comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses less enterprise revenue and is presented on a per commissionable Approved Submission basis. The estimate of the future renewal commissions is determined by using the contracted renewal commission rates constrained by a persistency-adjusted renewal period. The persistency-adjusted renewal period is determined based on our historical experience and available industry and insurance carrier historical data. Persistency-adjustments allow us to estimate renewal revenue only to the extent probable that a material reversal in revenue would not be expected to occur. These factors may result in varying values from period to period. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our operating results may be adversely impacted by factors that impact our estimate of LTV\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMarketing and Advertising\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of changes in the financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. A discussion and analysis regarding our results of operations for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in our final prospectus for our IPO filed with the SEC on July 16, 2020 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the Prospectus\u201d).\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 58 \nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements recently adopted and not yet adopted, see Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmortization of intangible assets expense was $94.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $28.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and no amortization of intangible assets expense for the Predecessor 2019 Period, and relates to the amortization of developed technology and customer relationships that were recognized as part of the purchase price allocation at the date of the Centerbridge Acquisition.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 57 \nSegment Information\nThe following table presents the percentages of revenues and profit (loss) generated by each of our operating segments for the periods presented:\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 60 \nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.3 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period and primarily consisted of $57.1 million in net loss and adjustments for non-cash items of $91.5 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $25.1 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by commissions receivable of $63.4 million, offset by increases in commissions payables of $19.2 million, which were each driven by increases in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our Consolidated Financial Statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Successor 2019 Period, the Predecessor 2019 Period and the twelve months ended December 31, 2018:\nThe following table presents the LTV per Approved Submission by product for the Medicare segments for the periods presented:\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), are presented in the tables below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items and include other expenses, costs and non-recurring items.\nThe Transactions\nNet cash used in operating activities was $9.3 million for the Successor 2019 Period, which consisted of $16.0 million in net income and adjustments for non-cash items of $100.8 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $126.1 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in commissions receivable of $204.0 million partially offset by an increase in commissions payables of $80.8 million, which were each driven by an increase in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $3.4 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period was due to borrowings under our predecessor revolving credit facility of $56.5 million, which was offset by the repayment of such borrowings (and related expenses in relation thereto) in the amount of $59.9 million, as well as payments of our capital lease obligations.\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish liabilities for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Our liabilities reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOverview\nWe collectively refer to the Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Incremental Term Loan Facility, the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility, and the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility as the Credit Facilities\u201d.\nThere are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a global pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nSegment profit for the IFP and Other-Internal segment was $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.7 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $2.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $0.4 million, or 11.0%, increase was primarily attributable to a change in product mix sold by agents for IFP and Other plans, as well as an overall strategic shift towards Medicare products.\nThe following tables present the number of Approved Submissions by product relating to commissionable policies for each of the Medicare segments for the periods presented. Only commissionable policies are used to calculate our LTV.\n\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 63 \nCommission revenues were $671.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $243.3 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $175.8 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $252.0 million, or 60.1%, increase was primarily attributable to increases in commission revenue from (i) the Medicare-Internal segment driven by a 87% increase in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions due to the hiring of additional agents, the increased utilization and efficiency of our agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to generate a greater number of qualified prospects and (ii) the Medicare-External segment driven by a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\ngenerated by us to external agencies. In this segment, we sell individual and family plans, dental plans, vision plans and other ancillary plans to individuals who are not Medicare-eligible. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers as a result of policy sales, as well as sales of consumer leads to external agencies.\nTotal Medicare Submitted Policies were 729,912 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 268,882 for the Successor 2019 Period and 158,815 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is attributable to improved multichannel marketing strategies that allowed us to generate a greater number of high quality prospects, along with increased efficiency of our agents. Agent efficiency increased due to the implementation of more efficient marketing strategies and improvements in our LeadScore and call-routing technologies, which allowed our agents to increase the number of qualified prospects they are able to talk to and improve the rate at which a qualified prospect converts to a Submitted Policy. Additionally, the successful hiring, onboarding, and training of additional agents contributed to the increase in Submitted Policies. We were also able to drive an increase in total Submitted Policies in the Medicare-External segment due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nMedicare-External\nRevenue Recognition and Commissions Receivable\n(6)Represents costs associated with the termination of employment.\nCustomer Care and Enrollment\nSubmitted Policies represent the number of completed applications that, with respect to each such application, the consumer has authorized us to submit to the carrier. The applicant may need to take additional actions, including providing subsequent information before the application is reviewed by the carrier.\nBusiness Segments\nThe following table presents the number of Submitted Policies by product for the Medicare segments for the periods presented, split between those submissions that are commissionable (compensated through commissions received from carriers) and those that are non-commissionable (compensated via hourly fees and enrollment fees):\nLTV per Approved Submission for Medicare Advantage was $995 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $1,018 for the Successor 2019 Period and $888 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is due to an increase in CMS-approved commission rates and a more diverse carrier base, allowing us to offer more products and plans that contributed to more long-term customer satisfaction.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 65 \nNet cash used in investing activities of $5.6 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to capitalized internal-use software related to new technology, software, and systems.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliations of GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nAdjusted EBITDA\nCost of revenue was $199.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $90.4 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $79.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $29.6 million, or 17.5%, increase was primarily attributable to a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions in the Medicare-External segment, which increased the amount of expense we recognized pursuant to our revenue-sharing agreements with external agents and other partners.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $810.0 million for the Successor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to the Centerbridge Acquisition, which comprised $807.6 million of net cash used in investing activities.\nPerforming a quantitative impairment test for goodwill includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, cash flow projections and selecting an appropriate discount rate.\nCash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including share-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; amortization of intangible assets; change in the fair value of contingent consideration; and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nApproved Submissions\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 56 \nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for share-based compensation, expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards, change in fair value of contingent consideration liability, Centerbridge Acquisition costs, severance costs and one time indirect costs in connection with the IPO. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\nOperating Activities\nTechnology expense was $59.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $6.0 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.3 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $13.0 million, or 28.1%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional employees in our technology and data science teams, and the expansion of our business intelligence and analytics staffing in order to support the growth of the Medicare-Internal segment. Technology expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $32.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO. The Predecessor 2019 Period included share-based compensation expense of $27.1 million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain legacy profit interests and legacy incentive share units granted prior to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nOn September 13, 2019, in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, Norvax entered into a first lien credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) which provides for a (i) $300.0 million aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) $30.0 million aggregate principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nApproved Submissions represent Submitted Policies approved by carriers for the identified product during the indicated period. Not all Approved Submissions will go in force, as some individuals we enroll may not ultimately pay their insurance premiums or may switch out of a policy within the disenrollment period during the first 90 days of the policy. In general, the relationship between Submitted Policies and Approved Submissions has been steady over time. Therefore, factors impacting the number of Submitted Policies also impact the number of Approved Submissions.\n\nEffective September 13, 2019 and in conjunction with the Centerbridge Acquisition, the Company authorized the grants of non-voting Profit Units. Profit Units consist of both Time-Vesting Units and Performance-Vesting Units and their fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Embedded in the simulation are several assumptions, including the expected life of the award based on estimates of the timing of a liquidity event, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility. The Time-Vesting Units' expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over a five year vesting period. The Performance-Vesting Units' expense is recognized upon a liquidity event based on certain predetermined criteria. Upon completion of our IPO, the implied performance condition was satisfied, triggering an accelerated vesting and related compensation expense of $209.3 million in the third quarter of 2020.\nmeasures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n(1)Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense relating to stock options, restricted stock units and time-vesting units.\n(4)Represents legal, accounting, consulting, and other costs related to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nCommissions receivable includes the variable consideration for policies that may renew, and therefore, are subject to the same assumptions, judgments and estimates used when recognizing revenue as noted above.\nLifetime Value of Commissions per Consumer Acquisition Cost\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 59 \n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 66 \nMedicare-Internal commissionable Approved Submissions were 495,561 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 170,764 for the Successor 2019 Period and 94,820 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase was attributable to the hiring of additional agents, the increased efficiency of our agents due to technology improvements and improved multichannel marketing strategies that allowed us to generate a greater number of high quality prospects.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe have elected the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company we are not required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor's attestation report on our systems of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (3) comply with the requirement of the PCAOB regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor's report on the financial statements and (4) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds\nThe Medicare annual enrollment period occurs from October 15th to December 7th. As a result, we experience an increase in the number of submitted Medicare-related applications during the fourth quarter and an increase in expense related to the Medicare segments during the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, as a result of the annual Medicare Advantage open enrollment period that occurs from January 1st to March 31st, commission revenue is typically second-highest in our first quarter. The second and third quarters are known as special election periods, and are our seasonally smallest quarters. A significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses is driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted through us. Marketing and advertising expenses are generally higher in the fourth quarter during the Medicare annual enrollment period, but because commissions from approved customers are paid to us over time, our operating cash flows could be adversely impacted by a substantial increase in marketing and advertising expenses as a result of a higher volume of applications submitted during the fourth quarter or positively impacted by a substantial decline in marketing and advertising expenses as a result of lower volume of applications submitted during the fourth quarter.\n(5)Represents legal, accounting, consulting, and other indirect costs associated with the Company's IPO.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liability\nIn accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nInterest Expense\nLTV per Approved Submission for prescription drug plans was $215 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $213 for the Successor 2019 Period and $194 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is primarily due to an increase in CMS-approved commission rates.\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $20.0 million of incremental revolving credit, (the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\n\nShare-Based Compensation\n(1)The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 includes $6.9 million of share-based compensation expense related to Time-Vesting Units, stock options and restricted stock units, and $209.3 million of share-based compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting of the Performance-Vesting Units in connection with the IPO. The period from January 1, 2019 through September 12, 2019 includes the Class C share-based compensation and incentive share plan expense recorded in connection with the Acquisition, and which totaled $87.1 million.\nLiabilities Pursuant to TRAs\n\u2022IFP and Other-Internal: The IFP and Other-Internal segment relates to sales of products and plans by GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans from multiple carriers, GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans on a carrier-specific basis, or DIY. In this segment, we sell individual and family plans, dental plans, vision plans and other ancillary plans to individuals who are not Medicare-eligible. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers based on sales we generate, as well as enrollment fees, and hourly fees and other fees for services performed for specific carriers and other partners.\nCustomer care and enrollment expense was $165.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $44.4 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $49.1 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $72.0 million, or 77.0%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional agents in the Medicare-Internal segment in order to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions. Additionally, customer care and enrollment expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $11.5 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO.\nOverview\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 68 \nEnterprise Revenues\nNet cash used in operating activities was $114.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of a $97.2 million net loss and positive adjustments for non-cash items of $335.2 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $352.2 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in commissions receivable of $427.5 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $24.0 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase in commissions payable of $107.6 million. The increases in commissions receivable and commissions payable were each driven by increases in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired.\nSubmitted Policies represent completed applications that, with respect to each such application, the consumer has authorized us to submit to the carrier. The applicant may need to take additional actions, including providing subsequent information before the application is reviewed by the carrier.\nIn addition to traditional financial metrics, we rely upon certain business and operating metrics to evaluate our business performance and facilitate our operations. Below are the most relevant business and operating metrics for each segment, except for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are not presented on a segment basis.\nInvesting Activities\nNet Revenues\nLifetime Value of Commissions Per Approved Submission\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 67 \nCommission Revenues\nIntangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicators of impairment are determined to exist. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from their use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nResponse to COVID-19\nCost of Revenue\nSubmitted Policies\nSegment profit for the Medicare-External segment was $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $10.6 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $4.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $9.5 million, or 61.6%, decrease was primarily attributable to agreements with external agents and other partners that had a higher revenue-sharing percentage as compared to prior agreements, which ultimately increased the amount of expense we recognized pursuant to these revenue-sharing agreements.\nA significant portion of marketing and advertising expense is driven by the number of qualified prospects required to generate the insurance applications submitted to carriers. Marketing and advertising costs are expensed and generally paid as incurred and since commission revenue is recognized upon approval of a submission but commission payments are paid to us over time, there are working capital requirements to fund the upfront cost of acquiring new policies.\n$700.0 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt over a rolling 36-month period.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liability was $19.7 million and $70.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and Successor 2019 Period, respectively, and relates to the earnout liability incurred in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, in which we agreed to pay additional consideration if certain financial targets are achieved. We had no earnout liability for the Predecessor 2019 Period.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.9 % 42.3 % 17.3 % 15.4 % \nNet cash provided by financing activities was $260.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock sold in the IPO, net of offering costs, of $852.4 million. Of the $852.4 million of IPO proceeds, $508.3 million was used to purchase LLC Interests, $100.0 million was used to settle the Senior Preferred Earnout Units, and $96.2 million was used as partial consideration for the Blocker Merger. Additionally, the Company made borrowings of $117.0 million under the Incremental Term Loan Facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest expense was $33.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8.1 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $0.1 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $24.8 million increase was due to additional debt outstanding on our Credit Facilities.\n\u2022Medicare-Internal: The Medicare-Internal segment relates to sales of products and plans by GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans from multiple carriers, GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans on a carrier-specific basis, or sales of products and plans through our online platform without the assistance of our agents, which we refer to as DIY. In this segment, we sell Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare prescription drug plans, and Medicare Special Needs Plans, or SNPs. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers based on sales we generated, as well as enrollment fees, hourly fees and other fees for services performed for specific carriers and other partners. The Medicare-Internal segment is our largest and fastest growing segment, and represented 96% of segment profits in 2020.\nSegment profit for the IFP and Other-External segment was $1.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.6 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $1.7 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $0.4 million, or 18.1%, decrease was primarily attributable to a change in product mix sold by external agencies, as well as an overall strategic shift towards Medicare products.\n\u2022Medicare-External: The Medicare-External segment relates to sales of products and plans under GoHealth's carrier contracts using an independent, national network of agents or external agencies, which are not employed by GoHealth. These agents utilize our technology and platform to enroll consumers in health insurance plans and provide us with a means to earn a return on leads that otherwise may have not been addressed. In this segment, we sell Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare prescription drug plans, and SNPs. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers as a result of policy sales, as well as sales of consumer leads to external agencies.\nNet Revenues\nWe use supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information, but which are not presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate its business and monitor its results of operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $14.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and consisted of capitalized internal-use software related to new technology, software, and systems and purchases of property and equipment.\nThe percentage ownership of total shares of Class A and Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:\n\u2022Goodwill and intangible assets;\nIFP and Other Segments\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 64 \nFinancing Activities\ntest-and-learn approach across our marketing channels, as well as an expansion of the diversity and breadth of our omnichannel marketing efforts, which together enabled the acquisition of higher quality prospects.\nIn connection with the IPO, we granted RSUs and stock options to employees and non-employee directors. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is calculated using a Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. Embedded in the pricing model are several assumptions, including the expected life of the award, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility. The assumptions we use represent management's best estimates. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our compensation expense for stock options could be materially different for future grants. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years for RSUs and three to four years for stock options. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nKey Business and Operating Metrics by Segment\nSubmitted Policies\nIn certain cases, numbers and percentages in the tables below may not foot due to rounding.\nGoHealth, Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of GoHealth Holdings, LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our status as a public company, plus payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be significant. We intend to cause GoHealth Holdings, LLC to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay these expenses and fund any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nSeasonality\nMedicare-External commissionable Approved Submissions were 166,615 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 62,673 for the Successor 2019 Period and 58,003 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase in Medicare-External commissionable Approved Submissions was attributable to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has determined there is no resulting liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement arising from the Transactions. Should the Company determine that the Tax Receivable Agreement liability is considered probable at a future date based on new information, any changes will be recorded within earnings at that time.\nCollection of commissions receivable depends upon the timing of the receipt of commission payments. If there were to be a delay in receiving a commission payment from a carrier within a quarter, the operating cash flows for that quarter could be adversely impacted.\nOperating Expense\nWith social distancing measures having been implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19, we successfully transitioned our agents and other employees to a work from home working environment. We believe the investments we have made in our technology infrastructure have allowed for a seamless transition to a remote working environment without any material impacts to our business, highlighting its resilience. We believe that our business is well-suited to navigate the current environment in which consumers are particularly focused on healthcare issues and mortality. While social distancing requirements have pushed consumers to conduct business remotely, the underlying demand dynamics for our core products remain unchanged. Additionally, because of our remote agent platform, we believe agents will continue to be attracted to our bonus-based agent compensation model and the stable and attractive source of income it can provide, thereby allowing us to continue to recruit and retain agents. Further, as consumers become more comfortable with conducting business remotely, we believe consumer adoption of distribution models such as ours may continue to accelerate long after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.\nOur agent base increased approximately 60% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nMarketing and advertising expense was $206.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $24.8 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $37.8 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $144.3 million, or 230.6%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our advertising costs for the Medicare-Internal segment to generate more qualified prospects, which contributed to a 87% increase in Medicare-Internal commissionable Approved Submissions. Additionally, marketing and advertising expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $24.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $830.9 million for the Successor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to the issuance of preferred units in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, which comprised $541.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which compromised $300.0 million of net cash provided by financing activities, and was partially offset by payments of existing debt, capital lease obligations and debt issuance costs.\n\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 62 \nTotal Submitted Policies for the IFP and Other segments were 120,674 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 146,228 for the Successor 2019 Period, 150,544 for the Predecessor 2019 Period and 207,695 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is due to a change in strategy to prioritize agents and marketing and advertising spend in the Medicare segments instead of the IFP and Other segments.\nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period, material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result. The accounting estimates and judgments related to the recognition of revenue require us to make assumptions about numerous factors, such as the determination of performance obligations and determination of the transaction price. The estimate of renewal commissions are considered variable consideration in the transaction price and requires significant judgment including determining the number of periods in which a renewal will occur and the value of those renewal commissions to be received if renewed. We utilize the expected value approach to do this, incorporating a combination of historical lapse and premium increase data, available industry and carrier experience data, historical payment data by segment and carrier, as well as current forecast data to estimate forecasted renewal considerations and then to constrain revenue recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved when the policy renews, and any adjustments in variable consideration are recognized in the period incurred.\nThe LTV/CAC for the Medicare-Internal segment was 3.0x (with a CAC of $162.2 million) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 5.1x (with a CAC of $32.5 million) for the Successor 2019 Period and 2.7x (with a CAC of $30.7 million) for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The decrease in LTV/CAC is attributable to the hiring and training of additional agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions, which increased 87% year over year in the Medicare-Internal segment.\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards, including Profit Units, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and stock options, based on the estimated grant date fair value of awards. Share-based compensation expense for Time-Vesting Units, RSUs and stock options are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally three to five years.\n\u2022Share-based compensation;\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determination of fair value involves significant estimates and assumptions including, among others, cash flow projections and selecting appropriate royalty and discount rates.\nOur operating segments have been determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 280, Segment Reporting. We have four operating segments: Medicare-Internal, Medicare-External, IFP and Other-Internal, and IFP and Other-External. In addition, we separately report other expenses (classified as Corporate expense\u201d in the following table), the primary components of which are corporate overhead expenses and shared service expenses that have not been allocated to the operating segments, as they are not the responsibility of segment operating management. The segment measurements provided to and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had principal amounts totaling $412.4 million, consisting of $296.3 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $116.1 million outstanding under the Incremental Term Loan Facility (collectively the Aggregate Term Loan Facility\u201d). We had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility, or the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility (collectively the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility had a remaining capacity of $58.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\nSegment Profit", "item_7_text": "Adjusted EBITDA was $271.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $130.5 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $100.6 million, or 59.0%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase in commission revenues in the Medicare segments as described above.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nThe preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. We regularly assess these estimates; however, actual amounts could differ from those estimates. The impact of changes in estimates is recorded in the period in which they become known.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the effect of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance. The accounting policies we believe to reflect our more significant estimates, judgments and assumptions that are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results are:\nThe following table sets forth the components of our results of operations for the periods presented:\nOur material contractual obligations generally include operating leases and capital leases, and long-term debt. Refer to Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our leasing obligations. Refer to Note 6, Long-Term Debt,\u201d of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our long-term debt obligations.\nOn March 20, 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $117.0 million of incremental term loans (the Incremental Term Loan Facility\u201d).\n(3)Represents the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability due to the predecessor owners of the Company arising from the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nJOBS Act\nMedicare-Internal\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 61 \nNet revenues for the Medicare-Internal segment were $667.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $215.3 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $102.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $349.8 million, or 110.2%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional agents, the increased utilization and efficiency of our agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to generate a greater number of qualified prospects, which contributed to a 87% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions. Our agent base increased approximately 60% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\n\n(2)Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and the accelerated vesting of profit interests and incentive share units in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition for the period from January 1, 2019 through September 12, 2019.\nWe are a leading health insurance marketplace and Medicare-focused digital health company whose mission is to improve access to healthcare in America. Our proprietary technology platform leverages modern machine-learning algorithms powered by nearly two decades of insurance behavioral data to reimagine the optimal process for helping individuals find the best health insurance plan for their specific needs. Our differentiated combination of a vertically-integrated consumer acquisition platform and highly skilled and trained agents has enabled us to enroll millions of people in Medicare and individual and family plans since our inception. With a current commissionable market of nearly $30 billion, and nearly 11,000 Americans turning 65 years old every day and our track record of significant growth in net revenues in the Medicare space in the past five years, we believe we will continue to be one of the top choices for unbiased insurance advice to help navigate one of the most important purchasing decisions individuals make.\nMedicare Segments\nLTV per Approved Submission for Medicare Supplement was $849 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $936 for the Successor 2019 Period and $911 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The decrease is primarily due to changes in carrier mix.\nWe use non-GAAP financial measures to supplement financial information presented on a GAAP basis. We believe that excluding certain items from our GAAP results allows management to better understand our consolidated financial performance from period to period and better project our future consolidated financial performance as forecasts are developed at a level of detail different from that used to prepare GAAP-based financial measures. Moreover, we believe these non-GAAP financial\n\u2022Liabilities pursuant to tax receivable agreements ( TRAs\u201d).\nNet revenues for the IFP and Other-Internal segment were $32.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $20.9 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $37.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. Net revenues for the IFP and Other-External segment were $22.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $34.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. For each of the IFP and Other segments, the decreases were primarily driven by a change in product mix sold, as well as a strategic shift towards Medicare products.\nOur historical results of operations prior to the completion of the Transactions, including the IPO, do not reflect certain items that we expect will affect our results of operations and financial condition after giving effect to the Transactions and the use of proceeds from the IPO.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nWe have four reportable segments: (i) Medicare-Internal, (ii) Medicare-External, (iii) Individual and Family Plans, or IFP and Other-Internal and (iv) IFP and Other-External. We organize the segments by product type, Medicare and IFP and Other, as well as by distribution channel, internal and external, as further described below. In addition, we separately report other expenses (classified as Corporate expenses\u201d in our financial statements), the primary components of which are corporate overhead expenses and shared service expenses that have not been allocated to the operating segments. The segment results provided herein may not be comparable to other companies. We refer to the Medicare-Internal and Medicare-External segments collectively as the Medicare segments\u201d and the IFP and Other-Internal and IFP and Other-External segments as the IFP and Other segments.\u201d\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nFollowing the completion of the Transactions, GoHealth, Inc. became the sole managing member of GoHealth Holdings, LLC. Although we have a minority economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, we have the sole voting interest in, and control of the business and affairs of, GoHealth Holdings, LLC and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a result, GoHealth, Inc. consolidates GoHealth Holdings, LLC and records significant non-controlling interest in a consolidated entity in GoHealth, Inc.'s Consolidated Financial Statements for the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC held directly or indirectly by the Continuing Equity Owners. As of December 31, 2020, public investors collectively own 51.7% of our outstanding Class A common stock, consisting of 43,513 shares of Class A common stock. As of December 31, 2020, GoHealth, Inc. owns 84,195 LLC Interests, representing 26.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, the Founders collectively own 97,301 LLC Interests, representing 30.9% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, Centerbridge owns 80,793 LLC Interests, representing 25.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC, and the Continuing Equity Owners collectively own 52,639 LLC Interests, representing 16.7% of the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2020, the economic interest in GoHealth Holdings, LLC held by non-controlling interest was 73.3%. GoHealth, Inc. is a holding company that conducts no operations and its principal asset is the LLC Interests we purchased from GoHealth Holdings, LLC.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.9 % 42.3 % 17.3 % 15.4 % \nAs of December 31, 2020, no impairment of goodwill has been recognized.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, the Company entered into a third amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $8.0 million of incremental revolving credit, (the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 54 \nWhen determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Management's estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation of purchase consideration to identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, as acquired definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives, whereas any indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as goodwill, are not amortized.\nJudgment in the assessment of qualitative factors of impairment include macroeconomic, industry and market conditions, cost considerations, our financial performance, events specific to our company, industry or reporting unit, and other relevant events. To the extent we determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, a quantitative test is then performed.\nOur liquidity needs primarily include working capital and debt service requirements. At December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents totaled $144.2 million. On July 17, 2020, we completed our IPO, which resulted in the issuance and sale of 43,500 shares of common stock at the IPO price of $21.00, and generating net proceeds of $852.4 million after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs. We believe that our current sources of liquidity, which include cash and cash equivalents and funds available under the Credit Facilities, as described further below, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and debt service requirements for at least the next 12 months. Short-term liquidity needs will primarily be funded through the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility, as described further below, if necessary. As of December 31, 2020, we had no amounts outstanding under the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility and had a remaining capacity of $58.0 million. To the extent that our current liquidity is insufficient to fund future activities, we may need to raise additional funds, which may include the sale of equity securities or through debt financing arrangements. The incurrence of additional debt financing would result in debt service obligations, and any future instruments governing such debt could provide for operating and financing covenants that could restrict our operations.\nDuring the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, no impairment has been recognized for either indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible assets.\n\u2022Income taxes; and\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have fully transitioned our existing agents in Chicago, Salt Lake City and Charlotte to work from home, and have since opened four new virtual sites in Tampa, Columbus, Phoenix and Dallas. These locations were selected because of the depth of available licensed sales talent and our ability to work closely with state regulators and their vendors to expedite the licensing process for new agents and resolve delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment profit for the Medicare-Internal segment was $296.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $126.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $130.6 million, or 78.6%, increase was primarily attributable to the 87% increase of Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions, which was primarily attributable to (i) improvements in our LeadScore and call-routing technologies allowing our agents to successfully convert more qualified prospects into Submitted Policies and (ii) improved marketing efficiencies driven by our rapid\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\u2022IFP and Other-External: The IFP and Other-External segment relates to sales of products and plans under GoHealth's carrier contracts using external agencies, who use agents that are not employed by GoHealth. These agents utilize our technology and platform to enroll consumers in health insurance plans. We also sell consumer leads\nLifetime value of commissions per commissionable Approved Submission, or LTV per Approved Submission, represents (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, divided by (ii) the number of commissionable Approved Submissions for such period. LTV per Approved Submission is equal to the sum of the commission revenue due upon the initial sale of a policy, and when applicable, an estimate of future renewal commissions per commissionable Approved Submissions. The estimate of the future renewal commissions is determined by using the contracted renewal commission rates constrained by a persistency-adjusted renewal period. The persistency-adjusted renewal period is determined based on our historical experience and available industry and carrier historical data. Persistency-adjustments allow us to estimate renewal revenue only to the extent probable that a material reversal in revenue would not be expected to occur. These factors may result in varying values from period to period. LTV per Approved Submission represents commissions only from policies sold during the period, but excludes policies originally submitted in prior periods.\nEnterprise revenues were $206.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $65.1 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $55.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $85.9 million, or 71.4%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $108.3 million related to partner marketing and enrollment services, partially offset by a $4.0 million decrease in direct partner campaigns in our Medicare-Internal segment and a $18.4 million decrease in consumer lead sales to external third parties in our external segments, as we strategically shifted to generating consumer leads in the internal channels.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 55 \nThe amounts payable under the Tax Receivable Agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors, including the amount, character, and timing of the taxable income of the Company in the future. In projecting future taxable income, the Company considers its historical results and incorporates certain assumptions, including revenue growth and operating margins, among others. The projection of future taxable income involves judgement and actual taxable income may differ from our estimates, which could impact the timing of payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. If the Company determines that it will not be able to fully utilize all or part of the related tax benefits, the Company would reduce the portion of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability related to the tax benefits not expected to be utilized through earnings at that time.\nCredit Facilities\nGeneral and administrative expense was $197.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $13.7 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $79.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $104.3 million, or 112.3%, increase was primarily attributable to investments in corporate infrastructure, such as legal, human resources, and finance, to support general growth and implement the corporate resources needed to support a post-IPO business. General and administrative expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $140.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO. General and administrative expense for the Predecessor 2019 Period included share-based compensation expense of $58.3 million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain legacy profit interests and legacy incentive share units granted prior to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nNet revenues for the Medicare-External segment were $155.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $59.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $56.0 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $40.5 million, or 35.2%, increase was primarily attributable to a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions in the Medicare-External segment due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\nIn connection with the IPO, the Company entered into the Tax Receivable Agreement with GHH, LLC, the Continuing Equity Owners and the Blocker Shareholders that will provide for the payment by the Company to the Continuing Equity Owners and the Blocker Shareholders of 85% of the amount of tax benefits, if any, that the Company actually realizes (or in some circumstances is deemed to realize) as a result of (1) the Company's allocable share of existing tax basis acquired in connection with the Transactions (including the Blocker Company's share of existing tax basis) and increases to such allocable share of existing tax basis; (2) increases in tax basis resulting from (a) the Company's purchase of LLC Interests directly from GHH, LLC and the partial redemption of LLC Interests by GHH, LLC, (b) future redemptions or exchanges (or deemed exchanges in certain circumstances) of LLC Interests for Class A common stock or cash, and (c) certain distributions (or deemed distributions) by GHH, LLC; and (3) certain additional tax benefits arising from payments made under the Tax Receivable Agreement. The Company may benefit from the remaining 15% of any tax benefits that the Company actually realizes.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 53 \nThis section presents management's perspective on our financial condition and results of operations. The following discussion and analysis is intended to highlight and supplement data and information presented elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes, and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying tables. To the extent that this discussion describes prior performance, the descriptions relate only to the periods listed, which may not be indicative of our future financial outcomes. In addition to historical information, this discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause results to differ materially from management's expectations. Factors that could cause such differences are discussed in the sections titled Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d Summary Risk Factors\u201d and Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We assume no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements.\n\u2022Revenue recognition and commissions receivable;\n\nTechnology\nLifetime value of commissions per consumer acquisition cost, or LTV/CAC, represents (i) aggregate commissions estimated to be collected over the estimated life of all commissionable Approved Submissions for the relevant period based on multiple factors, including but not limited to, contracted commission rates, carrier mix and expected policy persistency with applied constraints, or LTV, divided by (ii) the cost to convert a qualified prospect into a Submitted Policy (comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses) less other non-commission carrier revenue for such period, or CAC. CAC is comprised of cost of revenue, marketing and advertising expenses and customer care and enrollment expenses less enterprise revenue and is presented on a per commissionable Approved Submission basis. The estimate of the future renewal commissions is determined by using the contracted renewal commission rates constrained by a persistency-adjusted renewal period. The persistency-adjusted renewal period is determined based on our historical experience and available industry and insurance carrier historical data. Persistency-adjustments allow us to estimate renewal revenue only to the extent probable that a material reversal in revenue would not be expected to occur. These factors may result in varying values from period to period. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Our operating results may be adversely impacted by factors that impact our estimate of LTV\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMarketing and Advertising\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of changes in the financial condition and results of operations for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019. A discussion and analysis regarding our results of operations for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 2018 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in our final prospectus for our IPO filed with the SEC on July 16, 2020 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act (the Prospectus\u201d).\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 58 \nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements recently adopted and not yet adopted, see Note 1, Description of Business and Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAmortization of intangible assets expense was $94.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $28.2 million for the Successor 2019 Period and no amortization of intangible assets expense for the Predecessor 2019 Period, and relates to the amortization of developed technology and customer relationships that were recognized as part of the purchase price allocation at the date of the Centerbridge Acquisition.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 57 \nSegment Information\nThe following table presents the percentages of revenues and profit (loss) generated by each of our operating segments for the periods presented:\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 60 \nWe allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill and represents the future economic benefits arising from other assets acquired in a business combination that are not individually identified and separately recognized.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $9.3 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period and primarily consisted of $57.1 million in net loss and adjustments for non-cash items of $91.5 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $25.1 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by commissions receivable of $63.4 million, offset by increases in commissions payables of $19.2 million, which were each driven by increases in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nWe qualify as an emerging growth company\u201d pursuant to the provisions of the JOBS Act, enacted on April 5, 2012. Section 102 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We are electing to delay the adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our Consolidated Financial Statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates.\nThe following table presents a summary of cash flows for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Successor 2019 Period, the Predecessor 2019 Period and the twelve months ended December 31, 2018:\nThe following table presents the LTV per Approved Submission by product for the Medicare segments for the periods presented:\nThe non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered as indicators of performance in isolation from or as a substitute for net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should be read only in conjunction with financial information presented on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to its most directly comparable GAAP financial measure, net income (loss), are presented in the tables below in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We encourage you to review the reconciliations in conjunction with the presentation of the non-GAAP financial measures for each of the periods presented. In future periods, we may exclude similar items, may incur income and expenses similar to these excluded items and include other expenses, costs and non-recurring items.\nThe Transactions\nNet cash used in operating activities was $9.3 million for the Successor 2019 Period, which consisted of $16.0 million in net income and adjustments for non-cash items of $100.8 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $126.1 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in commissions receivable of $204.0 million partially offset by an increase in commissions payables of $80.8 million, which were each driven by an increase in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $3.4 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period was due to borrowings under our predecessor revolving credit facility of $56.5 million, which was offset by the repayment of such borrowings (and related expenses in relation thereto) in the amount of $59.9 million, as well as payments of our capital lease obligations.\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires management's judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. Judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items. We establish liabilities for material, known tax exposures relating to deductions, transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item. Our liabilities reflect our judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review. When facts and circumstances change (including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration), these liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n\nOverview\nWe collectively refer to the Term Loan Facility, the Revolving Credit Facility, the Incremental Term Loan Facility, the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility, and the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility as the Credit Facilities\u201d.\nThere are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19 and a global pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations. See Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nResults of Operations\nSegment profit for the IFP and Other-Internal segment was $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $1.7 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $2.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $0.4 million, or 11.0%, increase was primarily attributable to a change in product mix sold by agents for IFP and Other plans, as well as an overall strategic shift towards Medicare products.\nThe following tables present the number of Approved Submissions by product relating to commissionable policies for each of the Medicare segments for the periods presented. Only commissionable policies are used to calculate our LTV.\n\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 63 \nCommission revenues were $671.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $243.3 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $175.8 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $252.0 million, or 60.1%, increase was primarily attributable to increases in commission revenue from (i) the Medicare-Internal segment driven by a 87% increase in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions due to the hiring of additional agents, the increased utilization and efficiency of our agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to generate a greater number of qualified prospects and (ii) the Medicare-External segment driven by a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\ngenerated by us to external agencies. In this segment, we sell individual and family plans, dental plans, vision plans and other ancillary plans to individuals who are not Medicare-eligible. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers as a result of policy sales, as well as sales of consumer leads to external agencies.\nTotal Medicare Submitted Policies were 729,912 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 268,882 for the Successor 2019 Period and 158,815 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is attributable to improved multichannel marketing strategies that allowed us to generate a greater number of high quality prospects, along with increased efficiency of our agents. Agent efficiency increased due to the implementation of more efficient marketing strategies and improvements in our LeadScore and call-routing technologies, which allowed our agents to increase the number of qualified prospects they are able to talk to and improve the rate at which a qualified prospect converts to a Submitted Policy. Additionally, the successful hiring, onboarding, and training of additional agents contributed to the increase in Submitted Policies. We were also able to drive an increase in total Submitted Policies in the Medicare-External segment due to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans using our technology and platform.\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Valuation allowances are provided when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nMedicare-External\nRevenue Recognition and Commissions Receivable\n(6)Represents costs associated with the termination of employment.\nCustomer Care and Enrollment\nSubmitted Policies represent the number of completed applications that, with respect to each such application, the consumer has authorized us to submit to the carrier. The applicant may need to take additional actions, including providing subsequent information before the application is reviewed by the carrier.\nBusiness Segments\nThe following table presents the number of Submitted Policies by product for the Medicare segments for the periods presented, split between those submissions that are commissionable (compensated through commissions received from carriers) and those that are non-commissionable (compensated via hourly fees and enrollment fees):\nLTV per Approved Submission for Medicare Advantage was $995 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $1,018 for the Successor 2019 Period and $888 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is due to an increase in CMS-approved commission rates and a more diverse carrier base, allowing us to offer more products and plans that contributed to more long-term customer satisfaction.\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 65 \nNet cash used in investing activities of $5.6 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to capitalized internal-use software related to new technology, software, and systems.\nThe following table sets forth the reconciliations of GAAP net income (loss) to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented:\nAdjusted EBITDA\nCost of revenue was $199.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $90.4 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $79.2 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $29.6 million, or 17.5%, increase was primarily attributable to a 38% increase in commissionable Approved Submissions in the Medicare-External segment, which increased the amount of expense we recognized pursuant to our revenue-sharing agreements with external agents and other partners.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $810.0 million for the Successor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to the Centerbridge Acquisition, which comprised $807.6 million of net cash used in investing activities.\nPerforming a quantitative impairment test for goodwill includes the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit, and involves significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include, among others, cash flow projections and selecting an appropriate discount rate.\nCash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including share-based compensation; depreciation and amortization; amortization of intangible assets; change in the fair value of contingent consideration; and amortization of debt discount and issuance costs and the effect of changes in working capital and other activities.\nApproved Submissions\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 56 \nAdjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA as further adjusted for share-based compensation, expense related to the accelerated vesting of certain equity awards, change in fair value of contingent consideration liability, Centerbridge Acquisition costs, severance costs and one time indirect costs in connection with the IPO. Adjusted EBITDA margin represents Adjusted EBITDA divided by net revenues.\nOperating Activities\nTechnology expense was $59.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $6.0 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $40.3 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $13.0 million, or 28.1%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional employees in our technology and data science teams, and the expansion of our business intelligence and analytics staffing in order to support the growth of the Medicare-Internal segment. Technology expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $32.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO. The Predecessor 2019 Period included share-based compensation expense of $27.1 million in connection with the accelerated vesting of certain legacy profit interests and legacy incentive share units granted prior to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nOn September 13, 2019, in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, Norvax entered into a first lien credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d) which provides for a (i) $300.0 million aggregate principal amount senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and (ii) $30.0 million aggregate principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\nApproved Submissions represent Submitted Policies approved by carriers for the identified product during the indicated period. Not all Approved Submissions will go in force, as some individuals we enroll may not ultimately pay their insurance premiums or may switch out of a policy within the disenrollment period during the first 90 days of the policy. In general, the relationship between Submitted Policies and Approved Submissions has been steady over time. Therefore, factors impacting the number of Submitted Policies also impact the number of Approved Submissions.\n\nEffective September 13, 2019 and in conjunction with the Centerbridge Acquisition, the Company authorized the grants of non-voting Profit Units. Profit Units consist of both Time-Vesting Units and Performance-Vesting Units and their fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation. Embedded in the simulation are several assumptions, including the expected life of the award based on estimates of the timing of a liquidity event, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility. The Time-Vesting Units' expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over a five year vesting period. The Performance-Vesting Units' expense is recognized upon a liquidity event based on certain predetermined criteria. Upon completion of our IPO, the implied performance condition was satisfied, triggering an accelerated vesting and related compensation expense of $209.3 million in the third quarter of 2020.\nmeasures provide our stakeholders with useful information to help them evaluate our operating results by facilitating an enhanced understanding of our operating performance and enabling them to make more meaningful period to period comparisons. There are limitations to the use of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For example, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.\n(1)Represents non-cash share-based compensation expense relating to stock options, restricted stock units and time-vesting units.\n(4)Represents legal, accounting, consulting, and other costs related to the Centerbridge Acquisition.\nCommissions receivable includes the variable consideration for policies that may renew, and therefore, are subject to the same assumptions, judgments and estimates used when recognizing revenue as noted above.\nLifetime Value of Commissions per Consumer Acquisition Cost\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 59 \n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 66 \nMedicare-Internal commissionable Approved Submissions were 495,561 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 170,764 for the Successor 2019 Period and 94,820 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase was attributable to the hiring of additional agents, the increased efficiency of our agents due to technology improvements and improved multichannel marketing strategies that allowed us to generate a greater number of high quality prospects.\nEBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nWe have elected the other exemptions and reduced reporting requirements provided by the JOBS Act. Subject to certain conditions set forth in the JOBS Act, as an emerging growth company we are not required to, among other things, (1) provide an auditor's attestation report on our systems of internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404, (2) provide all of the compensation disclosure that may be required of non-emerging growth public companies under the Dodd-Frank Act, (3) comply with the requirement of the PCAOB regarding the communication of critical audit matters in the auditor's report on the financial statements and (4) disclose certain executive compensation-related items, such as the correlation between executive compensation and performance and comparisons of the Chief Executive Officer's compensation to median employee compensation. These exemptions will apply until we no longer meet the requirements of being an emerging growth company. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds\nThe Medicare annual enrollment period occurs from October 15th to December 7th. As a result, we experience an increase in the number of submitted Medicare-related applications during the fourth quarter and an increase in expense related to the Medicare segments during the third and fourth quarters. Additionally, as a result of the annual Medicare Advantage open enrollment period that occurs from January 1st to March 31st, commission revenue is typically second-highest in our first quarter. The second and third quarters are known as special election periods, and are our seasonally smallest quarters. A significant portion of our marketing and advertising expenses is driven by the number of health insurance applications submitted through us. Marketing and advertising expenses are generally higher in the fourth quarter during the Medicare annual enrollment period, but because commissions from approved customers are paid to us over time, our operating cash flows could be adversely impacted by a substantial increase in marketing and advertising expenses as a result of a higher volume of applications submitted during the fourth quarter or positively impacted by a substantial decline in marketing and advertising expenses as a result of lower volume of applications submitted during the fourth quarter.\n(5)Represents legal, accounting, consulting, and other indirect costs associated with the Company's IPO.\nChange in Fair Value of Contingent Consideration Liability\nIn accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that an entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nInterest Expense\nLTV per Approved Submission for prescription drug plans was $215 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, $213 for the Successor 2019 Period and $194 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase is primarily due to an increase in CMS-approved commission rates.\nOn May 7, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the Credit Agreement, which provided $20.0 million of incremental revolving credit, (the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility\u201d).\n\nShare-Based Compensation\n(1)The twelve months ended December 31, 2020 includes $6.9 million of share-based compensation expense related to Time-Vesting Units, stock options and restricted stock units, and $209.3 million of share-based compensation expense associated with the accelerated vesting of the Performance-Vesting Units in connection with the IPO. The period from January 1, 2019 through September 12, 2019 includes the Class C share-based compensation and incentive share plan expense recorded in connection with the Acquisition, and which totaled $87.1 million.\nLiabilities Pursuant to TRAs\n\u2022IFP and Other-Internal: The IFP and Other-Internal segment relates to sales of products and plans by GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans from multiple carriers, GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans on a carrier-specific basis, or DIY. In this segment, we sell individual and family plans, dental plans, vision plans and other ancillary plans to individuals who are not Medicare-eligible. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers based on sales we generate, as well as enrollment fees, and hourly fees and other fees for services performed for specific carriers and other partners.\nCustomer care and enrollment expense was $165.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $44.4 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $49.1 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $72.0 million, or 77.0%, increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional agents in the Medicare-Internal segment in order to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions. Additionally, customer care and enrollment expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $11.5 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO.\nOverview\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 68 \nEnterprise Revenues\nNet cash used in operating activities was $114.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of a $97.2 million net loss and positive adjustments for non-cash items of $335.2 million, offset by the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities representing a $352.2 million use of cash. The change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily driven by an increase in commissions receivable of $427.5 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $24.0 million and a decrease in deferred revenue of $14.5 million, partially offset by an increase in commissions payable of $107.6 million. The increases in commissions receivable and commissions payable were each driven by increases in Medicare commissionable Approved Submissions.\nGeneral and Administrative\nWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill may be impaired.\nSubmitted Policies represent completed applications that, with respect to each such application, the consumer has authorized us to submit to the carrier. The applicant may need to take additional actions, including providing subsequent information before the application is reviewed by the carrier.\nIn addition to traditional financial metrics, we rely upon certain business and operating metrics to evaluate our business performance and facilitate our operations. Below are the most relevant business and operating metrics for each segment, except for EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, which are not presented on a segment basis.\nInvesting Activities\nNet Revenues\nLifetime Value of Commissions Per Approved Submission\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 67 \nCommission Revenues\nIntangible assets subject to amortization are also evaluated for impairment when indicators of impairment are determined to exist. Recoverability of these assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate from their use and eventual disposition. If such review indicates that the carrying amount of intangible assets is not recoverable, the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value.\nResponse to COVID-19\nCost of Revenue\nSubmitted Policies\nSegment profit for the Medicare-External segment was $5.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $10.6 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $4.9 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $9.5 million, or 61.6%, decrease was primarily attributable to agreements with external agents and other partners that had a higher revenue-sharing percentage as compared to prior agreements, which ultimately increased the amount of expense we recognized pursuant to these revenue-sharing agreements.\nA significant portion of marketing and advertising expense is driven by the number of qualified prospects required to generate the insurance applications submitted to carriers. Marketing and advertising costs are expensed and generally paid as incurred and since commission revenue is recognized upon approval of a submission but commission payments are paid to us over time, there are working capital requirements to fund the upfront cost of acquiring new policies.\n$700.0 million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt over a rolling 36-month period.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration liability was $19.7 million and $70.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and Successor 2019 Period, respectively, and relates to the earnout liability incurred in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, in which we agreed to pay additional consideration if certain financial targets are achieved. We had no earnout liability for the Predecessor 2019 Period.\n Adjusted EBITDA margin 30.9 % 42.3 % 17.3 % 15.4 % \nNet cash provided by financing activities was $260.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and was primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of Class A common stock sold in the IPO, net of offering costs, of $852.4 million. Of the $852.4 million of IPO proceeds, $508.3 million was used to purchase LLC Interests, $100.0 million was used to settle the Senior Preferred Earnout Units, and $96.2 million was used as partial consideration for the Blocker Merger. Additionally, the Company made borrowings of $117.0 million under the Incremental Term Loan Facility during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020.\nInterest expense was $33.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $8.1 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $0.1 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $24.8 million increase was due to additional debt outstanding on our Credit Facilities.\n\u2022Medicare-Internal: The Medicare-Internal segment relates to sales of products and plans by GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans from multiple carriers, GoHealth-employed agents offering qualified prospects plans on a carrier-specific basis, or sales of products and plans through our online platform without the assistance of our agents, which we refer to as DIY. In this segment, we sell Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare prescription drug plans, and Medicare Special Needs Plans, or SNPs. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers based on sales we generated, as well as enrollment fees, hourly fees and other fees for services performed for specific carriers and other partners. The Medicare-Internal segment is our largest and fastest growing segment, and represented 96% of segment profits in 2020.\nSegment profit for the IFP and Other-External segment was $1.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $0.6 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $1.7 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $0.4 million, or 18.1%, decrease was primarily attributable to a change in product mix sold by external agencies, as well as an overall strategic shift towards Medicare products.\n\u2022Medicare-External: The Medicare-External segment relates to sales of products and plans under GoHealth's carrier contracts using an independent, national network of agents or external agencies, which are not employed by GoHealth. These agents utilize our technology and platform to enroll consumers in health insurance plans and provide us with a means to earn a return on leads that otherwise may have not been addressed. In this segment, we sell Medicare Advantage, Medicare Supplement, Medicare prescription drug plans, and SNPs. We earn revenue in this segment through commissions paid by carriers as a result of policy sales, as well as sales of consumer leads to external agencies.\nNet Revenues\nWe use supplemental measures of our performance that are derived from our consolidated financial information, but which are not presented in our Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures include net income (loss) before interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation and amortization expense, or EBITDA; Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin. Adjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure used by management to evaluate its business and monitor its results of operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $14.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and consisted of capitalized internal-use software related to new technology, software, and systems and purchases of property and equipment.\nThe percentage ownership of total shares of Class A and Class B common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020, is as follows:\n\u2022Goodwill and intangible assets;\nIFP and Other Segments\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 64 \nFinancing Activities\ntest-and-learn approach across our marketing channels, as well as an expansion of the diversity and breadth of our omnichannel marketing efforts, which together enabled the acquisition of higher quality prospects.\nIn connection with the IPO, we granted RSUs and stock options to employees and non-employee directors. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the stock price on the date of grant. The fair value of stock options is calculated using a Black-Scholes-Merton pricing model. Embedded in the pricing model are several assumptions, including the expected life of the award, the expected dividend yield, the risk-free interest rate and the expected volatility. The assumptions we use represent management's best estimates. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our compensation expense for stock options could be materially different for future grants. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally four years for RSUs and three to four years for stock options. We recognize forfeitures as they occur.\nKey Business and Operating Metrics by Segment\nSubmitted Policies\nIn certain cases, numbers and percentages in the tables below may not foot due to rounding.\nGoHealth, Inc. is subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes with respect to our allocable share of any taxable income of GoHealth Holdings, LLC and is taxed at the prevailing corporate tax rates. In addition to tax expenses, we also incur expenses related to our status as a public company, plus payment obligations under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which could be significant. We intend to cause GoHealth Holdings, LLC to make distributions to us in an amount sufficient to allow us to pay these expenses and fund any payments due under the Tax Receivable Agreement.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nSeasonality\nMedicare-External commissionable Approved Submissions were 166,615 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 62,673 for the Successor 2019 Period and 58,003 for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The increase in Medicare-External commissionable Approved Submissions was attributable to our ability to recruit and onboard additional external agents to enroll consumers in Medicare plans.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company has determined there is no resulting liability related to the Tax Receivable Agreement arising from the Transactions. Should the Company determine that the Tax Receivable Agreement liability is considered probable at a future date based on new information, any changes will be recorded within earnings at that time.\nCollection of commissions receivable depends upon the timing of the receipt of commission payments. If there were to be a delay in receiving a commission payment from a carrier within a quarter, the operating cash flows for that quarter could be adversely impacted.\nOperating Expense\nWith social distancing measures having been implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19, we successfully transitioned our agents and other employees to a work from home working environment. We believe the investments we have made in our technology infrastructure have allowed for a seamless transition to a remote working environment without any material impacts to our business, highlighting its resilience. We believe that our business is well-suited to navigate the current environment in which consumers are particularly focused on healthcare issues and mortality. While social distancing requirements have pushed consumers to conduct business remotely, the underlying demand dynamics for our core products remain unchanged. Additionally, because of our remote agent platform, we believe agents will continue to be attracted to our bonus-based agent compensation model and the stable and attractive source of income it can provide, thereby allowing us to continue to recruit and retain agents. Further, as consumers become more comfortable with conducting business remotely, we believe consumer adoption of distribution models such as ours may continue to accelerate long after the COVID-19 pandemic ends.\nOur agent base increased approximately 60% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nMarketing and advertising expense was $206.9 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 compared to $24.8 million for the Successor 2019 Period and $37.8 million for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The $144.3 million, or 230.6%, increase was primarily attributable to an increase in our advertising costs for the Medicare-Internal segment to generate more qualified prospects, which contributed to a 87% increase in Medicare-Internal commissionable Approved Submissions. Additionally, marketing and advertising expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 included $24.6 million of share-based compensation expense relating to the accelerated vesting of performance-vesting units in connection with the IPO.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $830.9 million for the Successor 2019 Period was primarily attributable to the issuance of preferred units in connection with the Centerbridge Acquisition, which comprised $541.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities and borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, which compromised $300.0 million of net cash provided by financing activities, and was partially offset by payments of existing debt, capital lease obligations and debt issuance costs.\n\n GoHealth, Inc. 2020 Form 10-K 62 \nTotal Submitted Policies for the IFP and Other segments were 120,674 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 146,228 for the Successor 2019 Period, 150,544 for the Predecessor 2019 Period and 207,695 for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018. The decrease is due to a change in strategy to prioritize agents and marketing and advertising spend in the Medicare segments instead of the IFP and Other segments.\nSignificant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period. If we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period, material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result. The accounting estimates and judgments related to the recognition of revenue require us to make assumptions about numerous factors, such as the determination of performance obligations and determination of the transaction price. The estimate of renewal commissions are considered variable consideration in the transaction price and requires significant judgment including determining the number of periods in which a renewal will occur and the value of those renewal commissions to be received if renewed. We utilize the expected value approach to do this, incorporating a combination of historical lapse and premium increase data, available industry and carrier experience data, historical payment data by segment and carrier, as well as current forecast data to estimate forecasted renewal considerations and then to constrain revenue recognized to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. The uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved when the policy renews, and any adjustments in variable consideration are recognized in the period incurred.\nThe LTV/CAC for the Medicare-Internal segment was 3.0x (with a CAC of $162.2 million) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 5.1x (with a CAC of $32.5 million) for the Successor 2019 Period and 2.7x (with a CAC of $30.7 million) for the Predecessor 2019 Period. The decrease in LTV/CAC is attributable to the hiring and training of additional agents and the implementation of new marketing strategies to drive the conversion of a greater number of qualified prospects into commissionable Approved Submissions, which increased 87% year over year in the Medicare-Internal segment.\nWe recognize compensation expense for all share-based awards, including Profit Units, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d) and stock options, based on the estimated grant date fair value of awards. Share-based compensation expense for Time-Vesting Units, RSUs and stock options are recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally three to five years.\n\u2022Share-based compensation;\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Determination of fair value involves significant estimates and assumptions including, among others, cash flow projections and selecting appropriate royalty and discount rates.\nOur operating segments have been determined in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 280, Segment Reporting. We have four operating segments: Medicare-Internal, Medicare-External, IFP and Other-Internal, and IFP and Other-External. In addition, we separately report other expenses (classified as Corporate expense\u201d in the following table), the primary components of which are corporate overhead expenses and shared service expenses that have not been allocated to the operating segments, as they are not the responsibility of segment operating management. The segment measurements provided to and evaluated by the chief operating decision maker are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with GAAP.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had principal amounts totaling $412.4 million, consisting of $296.3 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility and $116.1 million outstanding under the Incremental Term Loan Facility (collectively the Aggregate Term Loan Facility\u201d). We had no amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Incremental Revolving Credit Facility, or the Incremental No. 3 Revolving Credit Facility (collectively the Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility\u201d). The Aggregate Revolving Credit Facility had a remaining capacity of $58.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\nSegment Profit", "item_7_tables": "Table 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 59% to $271 million in 2020 compared to 2019, driven by growth in Medicare commission revenues.\n\n- Medicare-Internal segment revenue grew 110% to $667 million in 2020, due to hiring more agents, increased agent efficiency, and new marketing strategies that generated more qualified prospects and commissionable Approved Submissions. \n\n- Marketing costs increased 231% to $207 million in 2020, due to higher advertising spend to generate Medicare leads. This contributed to 87% growth in Medicare-Internal commissionable Approved Submissions.\n\n- Net loss was $97 million in 2020 compared to net income of $16 million in 2019, driven by higher operating expenses related to investments in infrastructure, personnel, and $209 million in IPO-related share-based compensation. \n\n- Cash used in operations was $114 million in 2020 compared to $9 million in 2019, due to increases in commissions receivable and payable tied to higher Medicare Approved Submissions. \n\n- In July 2020, the company completed its IPO, generating net proceeds of $852 million. $508 million was used to purchase LLC Interests and settle earnout liabilities.\n\nOverall, the company showed strong revenue growth in its Medicare segments driven by investments in marketing, technology, and agents. Higher operating expenses driven by IPO-related costs contributed to a net loss in 2020."}
