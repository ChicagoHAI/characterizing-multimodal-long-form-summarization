Our hospitals provide a broad range of hospital and outpatient healthcare services, including general and acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic services, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. For our hospital operations business, we are paid for our services by governmental agencies, private insurers and directly by the patients we serve. We also operate QHR, a leading hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business. For our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business, we are paid by the non-affiliated hospitals utilizing our services. Over 95% of our net operating revenues are attributable to our hospital operations business.\nWe perform an ongoing strategic review of our hospitals based on an analysis of financial performance, current competitive conditions, expected demographic trends, joint venture opportunities and capital allocation requirements. We are actively engaging in initiatives to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins, among others. In 2016, we sold two hospitals and their affiliated entities for combined proceeds of $13.8 million. In 2017, we sold five hospitals and their affiliated entities for combined proceeds of $32.1 million. We have targeted an additional seven hospitals that we intend to divest or close within twelve to twenty-four months. We continually evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture which could result in changes to the hospitals included in this group in future periods. The seven targeted potential divestiture hospitals had net operating income (losses) of $(40.7) million, $(17.7) million and $(20.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nWe refer to the seven hospitals that we have divested through December 31, 2017 as the Divestitures Group, the seven remaining hospitals targeted for divestiture as the Potential Divestitures Group and the remaining twenty-four hospitals that we operate as the Continuing Hospitals Group. We believe that a discussion of our operating results that distinguishes between those hospitals that management does not foresee as being part of our ongoing hospital operations business and those hospitals that will become our core hospital operations business, and available to service our debt obligations into the future, is meaningful to our stockholders, investors and other users of our financial statements. See - Overview - Recent Divestiture Activity\u201d below for additional information on our divestitures activities. These hospital groups are also further defined in - Results of Operations\u201d below.\nOn March 1, 2018, we sold 70-bed Vista Medical Center West and its affiliated facilities, located in Waukegan, Illinois, for proceeds of $1.2 million.\nWe have a definitive agreement to sell another hospital in the Potential Divestitures Group, 77-bed Clearview Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities, located in Monroe, Georgia. We currently anticipate completing the sale of this hospital in the first quarter of 2018.\nOn January 5, 2018, we announced plans to close Affinity Medical Center ( Affinity\u201d) in Massillon, Ohio. Subsequent to January 5, 2018, our affiliates entered into an agreement with the City of Massillon related to the closure whereby all of the owned real property and a substantial majority of the related tangible assets located at the hospital will be transferred to the City of Massillon in exchange for nominal consideration and the assumption of certain ongoing real property lease obligations and equipment lease obligations. Operations ceased on February 11, 2018 and we currently anticipate the asset transfer to the City of Massillon will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $16.1 million and $20.2 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Affinity during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.\nOur strategic review process is ongoing and we may be unable to divest or realize proceeds from the sale or closure of any or all hospitals we consider for divestiture. We may also be subject to impairment charges in the future as a result of our ongoing strategic review process.\n2017 Financial Overview\nOur net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $66.3 million to $2,072.2 million compared to $2,138.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a 3.1% decrease. Net operating revenues decreased $108.8 million related to the Divestitures Group. Excluding the Divestitures Group, net operating revenues increased $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to favorable volume and payor rate variances. Net loss attributable to Quorum Health Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2017 were $(114.2) million compared to $(347.7) million for the same period in 2016. The 2017 period included long-lived asset and goodwill impairment of $47.3 million related to hospitals held for sale or identified for divestiture, $21.0 million reduction in net operating revenues as a result of a change in estimate related to the collectability of patient accounts receivable, $0.3 million in transaction costs related to the Spin-off and a net gain of $5.2 million on the sale of hospitals. The 2016 period included $291.9 million of impairment related to our hospital operations business, consisting of $166.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets, $125.0 million of impairment to goodwill, $5.4 million of transaction costs related to the Spin-off, a net loss of $2.2 million on the sale of hospitals and a $22.8 million reduction in net operating revenues as a result of a change in estimate related to the collectability of patient accounts receivable. On a same-facility basis, our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect a 0.5% decrease in admissions and a 0.4% increase in adjusted admissions compared to the same period in 2016. Excluding the Divestitures Group and Potential Divestitures Group, admissions and adjustment admissions increased 0.9% and 2.2% respectively, for these same periods.\n2017 Impairment\nThe following

During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized $12.9 million of impairment to property and equipment of certain hospitals in our Potential Divestitures Group for which we have received letters of intent. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, management made a decision to classify certain additional hospitals as held for sale. In connection with this decision, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of the hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $3.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which consisted of $1.1 million of property and equipment, $0.8 million of intangible assets and $1.4 million of goodwill impairment.\n2016 Impairment\nThe following table provides a summary of the impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 subsequent to the Spin-off (in thousands):\nTable 211: <table>

and evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture. As a result, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and recorded $45.4 million of long-lived asset impairment in this quarter. In addition, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals we classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of our hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2015 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $5.0 million of goodwill impairment in this quarter. In this same quarter, we identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to our hospital operations reporting unit and concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. The primary indicators were our declining market capitalization, as compared to the carrying value of equity, and a decrease in estimated future earnings of our hospital operations reporting unit. We performed a calculation of the overall fair value of this reporting unit in step one of the impairment test and concluded that the carrying value of the hospital operations reporting unit as of June 30, 2016 exceeded its estimated fair value. We performed a preliminary step two calculation of goodwill impairment to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of the hospital operations reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimated and recorded additional goodwill impairment of $200 million in the second quarter of 2016.\nFor step two goodwill impairment testing, we engaged a professional valuation firm to perform a hypothetical purchase price valuation of each of our hospitals utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date. The results of the third-party valuation, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, indicated that the carrying values of certain of our individual hospitals exceeded their fair values. Considering these results to be an indicator of potential impairment and to assess whether any additional impairment of long-lived assets existed, we utilized a September 30, 2016 measurement date and the same professional valuation firm to perform an analysis of undiscounted cash flows for each hospital in which an indicator of impairment was identified. Based on the results of these analyses, we recorded impairment of $82.7 million related to long-lived assets at certain of our hospitals and a downward adjustment to our previously recorded goodwill impairment estimate of $80.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our final assessment of goodwill impairment took into consideration the impairment adjustments to the carrying values of the hospital long-lived assets. The net impact to our financial statements was $2.7 million of additional impairment in the fourth quarter of 2016 beyond the initial estimate of $200 million recorded as the preliminary step-two calculation in the second quarter of 2016.\nIn addition to the above, we experienced a decline in operating results at several of our hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016. This led management to perform additional testing for impairment using a December 31, 2016 measurement date. As a result of this analysis, we recorded additional impairment of $38.8 million related to held for use assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The carrying values of long-lived assets, including those classified as held for sale, are reported in our balance sheet net of impairment as of December 31, 2016.\nThe Spin-off\nOn April 29, 2016, CHS completed the Spin-off of 38 hospitals, including their affiliated outpatient facilities, and QHR to form Quorum Health Corporation through the distribution of 100% of QHC common stock to CHS stockholders of record on April 22, 2016 (the Record Date\u201d). Each CHS stockholder received a distribution of one share of QHC common stock for every four shares of CHS common stock held as of the Record Date, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol QHC\u201d on May 2, 2016.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the Senior Notes\u201d) on April 22, 2016 and entered into a credit agreement on April 29, 2016, consisting of an $880 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), or on a combined basis referred to as the Senior Credit Facility.\u201d In addition, we entered into a $125 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The net offering proceeds of the Senior Notes, together with the net borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, were used to make a $1.2 billion payment from QHC to CHS and to pay our transaction and financing fees and expenses.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, certain agreements were established by CHS that govern and continue to govern matters related to the Spin-off. These agreements include, among others, a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. Various transition services agreements were established by CHS that define agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to QHC. The transition services agreements generally have five-year terms and include, among others, the provision for services related to information technology, payroll processing, certain human resources functions, patient eligibility screening, billing, collections and other revenue management services.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, CHS made a non-cash capital contribution of $530.6 million and transferred $13.5 million of cash to us on the Spin-off date. The cash transfer consisted of an agreed upon $20.0 million for the initial funding of our working capital, reduced by $6.5 million for the difference in estimated and actual financing fees and expenses incurred at the closing of the Spin-off.\nThe following table contains a summary of the major transactions to effect the Spin-off of QHC as a newly formed, independent company (dollars in

The Company also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $4.8 million related to Sandhills during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nHealthcare Reform\nThe Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. However, there is considerable uncertainty with regard to the future of the Affordable Care Act, as the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the law, its implementation and its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. In addition, several private health insurers have withdrawn from or limited their participation in the healthcare insurance exchanges, and the presidential administration has taken steps, including ending cost-sharing subsidies that were previously available to insurers, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces. Healthcare reform initiatives, including efforts to change, alter the implementation of, or repeal the Affordable Care Act, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nOther Government Regulations\nOur hospital operations business is highly regulated. We are required to comply with extensive, complicated and overlapping governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations govern every aspect of how our hospitals conduct their operations, including the service lines that must be offered for licensure as an acute care hospital, restrictions related to employing physicians, and requirements applicable to eligibility and payment structures under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in severe penalties including criminal penalties, civil sanctions, and the loss of our ability to qualify for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nRules, regulations and laws imposed on the U.S. healthcare industry are subject to ongoing and frequent changes with little or no notice and are often interpreted and applied differently by various regulatory agencies with authority to enforce such requirements. Each change or conflicting interpretation may require us to make changes at our hospitals and other healthcare facilities related to aspects such as space usage, equipment, technology, staffing and service lines. We may also be required to revise or implement operating policies and procedures that were previously believed to be compliant. The cost of compliance with governmental laws and regulations is a significant component of our overall operating costs. Furthermore, these costs have been rising in recent years due to new regulatory requirements and increasing enforcement provisions. Management anticipates that compliance costs will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. The U.S. healthcare industry has seen a number of ongoing investigations related to patient referrals, physician recruiting and employment practices, cost reporting and billing practices, medical necessity of inpatient admissions, physician office leasing, laboratory and home healthcare services, physician ownership of hospitals and other healthcare providers, and joint ventures involving hospitals and physicians. Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the OIG, DOJ and other governmental fraud and abuse regulatory authorities and programs.\nBasis of Presentation\nPrior to our separation from CHS, QHC did not operate as a separate company and stand-alone financial statements were not historically prepared; however, QHC was comprised of certain stand-alone legal entities for which discrete financial information was available under CHS' ownership. Our accompanying financial statements include amounts and disclosures for QHC that have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of CHS for the periods prior to the Spin-off in combination with the amounts and disclosures related to the stand-alone financial statements and accounting records of QHC after the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the carve-out of financial information from CHS.\nThe statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, as presented herein, include expense allocations for certain corporate functions provided by CHS to QHC for the periods prior to the Spin-off, including, but not limited to, executive and divisional management, employee benefits administration, treasury, accounting, risk management, audit, legal, procurement, human resources, information technology support and other administrative support services. These expenses were allocated to QHC based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated to QHC using ratios based on revenues, expenses or licensed beds. Following the Spin-off, we began performing corporate functions using internal resources or purchased services, certain of which are being provided by CHS pursuant to the transition services agreements and other ancillary agreements.\nFor the periods prior to the Spin-off, CHS used a centralized approach to cash management and to finance its operations, which included the operations of QHC. For these periods, cash and cash equivalents were swept to the CHS corporate accounts and transactions between QHC and CHS were accounted for through Due to Parent, net. This liability to CHS was settled in full on the transaction date, in part by a cash payment to CHS of $1.2 billion funded with net proceeds from the debt issuances that occurred in connection with the Spin-off. The remainder of the liability was extinguished and reclassified as a capital contribution to QHC. See Note 11 - Equity in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the equity established in connection with the Spin-off. Following the Spin-off, we established our own depository and disbursement cash accounts with various banks and use a centralized approach to cash management.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenues by providing healthcare services at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities to patients seeking medical treatment. Hospital revenues depend on, among other factors, inpatient occupancy and acuity levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges and negotiated reimbursement rates for the healthcare services provided. Our primary sources of payment for patient healthcare services are third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs, commercial insurance companies, other managed care programs, workers' compensation carriers and employers. Self-pay revenues are the portion of our revenues generated from providing healthcare services to patients who do not have health insurance coverage as well as the patient responsibility portion of charges that are not covered for an individual by a health insurance program or plan. We generate revenues related to our QHR business when hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services are provided. We report these revenues at their net realizable value. We generate other non-patient revenues primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.\nAmounts we collect for medical treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental third-party payors are generally less than our standard billing rates. Our standard charges and reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of medical procedure performed and the geographical location of the hospital. Differences in our standard billing rates and the amounts we expect to collect from third-party payors are classified as contractual allowances. The reimbursements we ultimately receive as payments for services are determined for each patient instance of care, based on the contractual terms we negotiate with third-party payors or based on federal and state regulations related to governmental healthcare programs. Our contractual allowances are impacted by the timing and ability of CHS to monitor the classification and collection of our patient accounts receivable. Billings and collections are outsourced to CHS under the transition services agreements that were put in place by CHS in connection with the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on these agreements. Except for emergency department services, our policy is to determine the payment methodology with patients prior to when the services are performed. Self-pay and other payor discounts are incentives offered to uninsured or underinsured patients or other payors to reduce their costs of healthcare services.\nA summary of our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 656,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 673,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 656,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 425,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 446,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 443,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Managed care and commercial\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 921,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 952,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 39.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 984,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Self-pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 226,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 242,095\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 247,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-patient\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 97,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 105,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,327,655\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,419,053\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,445,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe table above includes an $11.4 million change in estimate we recorded as of December 31, 2016 to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable due to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program. This change in estimate negatively impacted contractual allowances associated with Medicaid revenues. In addition, net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, declined $135.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to the seven hospitals we have divested.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Medicare revenues related to Medicare Advantage Plans were $186.7 million, $170.4 million and $146.9 million, respectively, or 28.4%, 25.3% and 22.4% as a percentage of total Medicare revenues, respectively.\nCharity Care\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for hospital care. The related charges for those patients who are financially unable to pay that otherwise do not qualify for reimbursement from a governmental program are classified as charity care. We determine amounts that qualify for charity care primarily based on the patient's household income relative to the poverty level guidelines established by the federal government. Our policy is not to pursue collections for such amounts; therefore, the related charges are recorded in operating revenues at the standard billing rates and fully offset in contractual allowances in the same period.\nElectronic Health Record Incentive Payments\nPursuant to the HITECH Act, MACRA and other laws, HHS has established Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs to encourage hospitals and healthcare professionals to adopt certified EHR technology. Eligible hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology can receive incentive payments, while hospitals that fail to do so are subject to payment reductions. We incur both capital expenditures and operating expenses in connection with the implementation of EHR technology initiatives. The amount and timing of these expenditures does not directly correlate with the timing of the receipt of EHR payments or the recognition of EHR incentives as earned. We record EHR incentives in our statements of income as a reduction to our operating costs and expenses. As we move toward our full implementation of certified EHR technology, our EHR incentives are declining and will ultimately end. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our EHR incentives earned were $4.7 million, $11.5 million and $25.8 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will earn approximately $1.5 million of EHR incentives in 2018.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates and judgments presented below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies that require estimates, but are limited to those that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts in our financial statements are appropriate. If actual results differ from these assumptions and considerations, the resulting impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThird-Party Reimbursements and State Supplemental Payment Programs\nOur estimate of the net realizable amount of our patient revenues due from third-party payors is subject to complexities, including interpretations of governmental regulations and payor-specific contractual agreements that are frequently changing. The Medicare and Medicaid programs, which are the payor sources for a major portion of our patient revenues, are highly complex programs and subject to interpretation of federal and state-specific reimbursement rates, new or changing legislation and final cost report settlements.\nContractual allowances are recorded in the period services are performed and the patient's method of payment is verified. Estimates for contractual allowances are subject to change, in large part, due to ongoing contract negotiations and regulatory changes, which is typical in the U.S. healthcare industry. Revisions to estimates for contractual allowances are recorded in the periods in which they become known and may be subject to further revisions. All hospital contractual allowance calculations are reviewed on a monthly basis by management to ensure reasonableness and accuracy.\nWe use a third-party automated contractual allowance system to calculate our contractual allowances each month. Contractual allowances are calculated utilizing historical paid claims data by payor source, which is uploaded into the system each month. The key assumptions used by the system to calculate the current period estimated contractual allowances are derived on a payor-specific basis from the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage and historical paid claims data. The automated contractual allowance system does not include patient account level information, as it estimates an average contractual allowance for each payor source. Due to the complexities involved in the contractual allowance estimates, actual reimbursement payments we receive from third-party payors could be different from the amounts we estimated and recorded. If the actual contractual reimbursement percentages by payor source differed by 1% from our estimated contractual reimbursement percentages, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed by $14.9 million. If we applied a 1% differential to our patient accounts receivable due from governmental, managed care and commercial third-party payors as of December 31, 2017, patient accounts receivable, net would have changed by $18.2 million.\nCost report settlements under reimbursement programs with Medicare, Medicaid and other managed care plans are estimated and recorded in the period patient services are performed and any revisions to estimates of previous program reimbursements are recorded in subsequent periods until the final cost report settlements are determined. We account for cost report settlements in contractual allowances in our statements of income and record these amounts as due from and due to third-party payors on our balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, contractual allowance adjustments related to previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements favorably (unfavorably) impacted our net operating revenues by $2.0 million, $(5.8) million and $(15.1) million, respectively. The 2015 amount included the unfavorable impact of an $11.1 million Illinois cost report settlement in 2014 that was reversed in the second quarter of 2015 due to contract negotiations that were finalized in that quarter. Exclusive of this adjustment, our net operating revenues were favorably (unfavorably) impacted by $(4.0) million in 2015 for all other contractual allowance adjustments related to previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements.\nSeveral states utilize supplemental payment programs, including disproportionate share programs, for the purpose of providing reimbursement to providers to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. The amounts due to us under such programs are included in due from third-party payors on our balance sheets. Some of these programs have participation costs, referred to as fees or provider taxes. We record these costs in due to third-party payors on our balance sheets. After a state supplemental program is approved and fully authorized, we recognize the reimbursement payments due to us from state supplemental payment programs in the periods amounts are estimable and revenue collection is reasonably assured. These amounts are recorded in operating revenues as favorable contractual allowances and the costs we incur under these programs are recorded as other operating expenses. We record the revenues as favorable contractual allowance adjustments in our net operating revenues and the related provider taxes as other operating expenses in our statements of income.\nThe following table shows the portion of our Medicaid reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs (in thousands):\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medicaid revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,448\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 220,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 211,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provider taxes and other expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,616\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs, net of expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 136,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 143,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 135,767\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe California Department of Health Care Services implemented the HQAF Program, imposing a fee on certain general and acute care California hospitals. Revenues generated from these fees provide funding for the non-federal supplemental payments to California hospitals that serve California's Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. Under Phase IV of the program, covering the period from January 2014 through December 2016, and Phase V of the program, covering the period from January 2017 through June 2019, we recognized $22.0 million, $34.4 million and $31.5 million of operating revenues, net of provider taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs related to hospitals that have been divested decreased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of due from and due to third-party payors (in thousands):\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts due from third-party payors:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 23,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State supplemental payment programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total amounts due from third-party payors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 97,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amounts due to third-party payors:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State supplemental payment programs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,542\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total amounts due to third-party payors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,537\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for Bad Debts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe following table provides a summary of patient accounts receivable, before contractual allowances, discounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts, by payor source (dollars in thousands):\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Third-parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,796,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,930,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Self-pay\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 596,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 656,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total patient accounts receivable, gross\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,393,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,586,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to patients at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities. Collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the patient financial responsibility portion of payments due from insured patients, generally deductibles and co-payments. Our policy is to verify the health insurance coverage of a patient prior to the procedure date for all medical treatment scheduled in advance. We do not verify insurance coverage in advance of treatment for walk-in and emergency room patients.\nWe estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving a percentage of all self-pay patient receivables without regard to aging category, based on collection history. The allowance percentage is based on a model that considers historical write-off activity and is adjusted for expected recoveries and any anticipated changes in trends. Our ability to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts is not significantly impacted by the aging of accounts receivable as management believes that substantially all of the risk exists at the point in time such accounts are identified as self-pay. For our insured receivables, which are non-self-pay receivables, we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection rates for the uncontractualized portion of all accounts aging over 365 days from the date of patient discharge, reduced by an estimate for expected recoveries. Generally, these non-self-pay accounts receivable aged over 365 days represent an immaterial percentage of our total patient accounts receivable on our balance sheets. We believe that we collect substantially all of our third-party insured receivables, which include receivables from governmental agencies.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.\nCollections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of CHS' billing and collection efforts, including their current policies on billings, accounts receivable payor classifications, collections, and our own efforts to further attempt collection. As previously stated, billings and collections are outsourced to CHS under the transition services agreements that were put in place with the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on these agreements. Significant changes in payor mix, centralized business office operations, including CHS'\nefforts in collecting the Company's accounts receivables, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage, among other things, could affect our collection levels and are considered in our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period. We also continually review our overall allowance adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections experience, revenue trends by payor classification and days revenue outstanding, the composition of self-pay receivables between pure self-pay patients and the patient responsibility portion of third-party insured receivables, and the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions.\nOur policy is to write off gross accounts receivable if the balance is under $10.00 or when such amounts are placed with outside collection agencies. We believe this policy accurately reflects our ongoing collection efforts and is consistent with practices within the U.S. healthcare industry. We had $474.3 million and $420.3 million of past due patient account balances at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, being pursued by secondary collection agencies, excluding accounts being pursued by PASI under the transition services agreement. We expect to collect less than 3%, net of estimated collection fees, of the amounts being pursued by these secondary collection agencies. As these amounts have been written-off, they are not included in our gross accounts receivable or our allowance for doubtful accounts. Collections of any account balances previously written off are recognized as a reduction to bad debt expense when received. However, we take into consideration estimated collections of these future amounts written-off in evaluating the reasonableness of our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nFor self-pay receivables, the total amount of contractual allowances, discounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces these receivables to their net carrying value was $545.8 million and $571.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If our self-pay receivables being pursued by outside collection agencies were included in both gross self-pay receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts above, the allowance for doubtful accounts related to self-pay receivables as a percentage of gross self-pay receivables would have been 94.5% and 92.1% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If our actual collection percentage differed by 1% from our estimated collection percentage as a result of a change in recoveries, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed $5.1 million. If we applied a 1% differential to our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts related to self-pay receivables as of December 31, 2017, our patient accounts receivable, net would have changed by $6.1 million.\nDays revenue outstanding related to patient accounts receivable, excluding amounts recorded as due from and due to third-party payors on our balance sheets, was 63 days and 68 days as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received $31 million of approximately $50 million of 2015 and 2016 outstanding amounts from the California HQAF program. In this same quarter, we also received a total of $51 million of the approximate $65 million in arrears from Illinois Medicaid and state employee patients. The portion of our allowance for doubtful accounts representing an adjustment for expected recoveries of self-pay receivables aged over 365 days that have been placed with outside collection agencies was 4 days as of December 31, 2017.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWhenever an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets may be impaired, we project the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. If the projections indicate that the carrying values are not expected to be recovered, the assets are reduced to their estimated fair value based on a quoted market price, if available, or an estimated value based on valuation techniques available in the circumstances.\nOur hospital operations and hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services operations meet the criteria to be classified as reporting units for goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. There is a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. Step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit's carrying amount, including goodwill. If this test indicates the fair value is less than the carrying value, then step two is required. Step two is to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. When an indicator of potential impairment is identified in interim periods, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at such date.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year. For our annual evaluation, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units utilizing two modeling approaches, a discounted cash flow model and an earnings multiple model. The discounted cash flow model applies a discount rate to our cash flow forecasts that is based on our best estimate of our weighted-average cost of capital. The earnings multiple model applies a market supported multiple to EBITDA. Both models are based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs and expenses as of the testing date. Additionally, the results of both models are reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization, which considers the amount a potential buyer would be required to pay, in the form of a control premium, to gain sufficient ownership to set policies, direct operations and control management decisions of our company.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairment of $47.3 million, $291.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively. See - Overview - 2017 Impairment and - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in these years.\nWorkers' Compensation and Professional and General Liability Insurance Reserve\nAs part of the business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we maintain insurance exceeding a self-insured retention level for these types of claims. Our self-insurance reserves reflect the current estimate of all outstanding losses, including incurred but not reported losses, based on actuarial calculations as of period end. The loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future due to updated facts and circumstances. Insurance expense in the statements of income includes the actuarially determined estimates for losses in the current year, including claims incurred but not reported, the changes in estimates for losses in prior years based on actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections, the insurance premiums for losses related to policies obtained to cover amounts in excess of our self-insured retention levels, the administrative costs of the insurance programs, and interest expense related to the discounted portions of these liabilities. Our reserves for workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims are based on semi-annual actuarial calculations, which are discounted to present value and consider historical claims data, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The liabilities for self-insured claims are discounted based on our risk-free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the self-insured claims are incurred and projected to be paid.\nA portion of our reserves for workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims included on our balance sheets relates to incurred but not reported claims prior to the Spin-off. These claims were fully indemnified by CHS under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a result, we have a corresponding receivable from CHS related to these claims on our balance sheets. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies - Insurance Reserves in the accompanying financial statements for a table that summarizes the liabilities and receivables associated with our workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nIncome Taxes\nThe breadth of our operations and the complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the amount of income taxes that we will ultimately pay. The amount of income taxes ultimately paid by us is dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal and state tax audits in the normal course of business.\nWe calculate our provision for income taxes and account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred income taxes during the year. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and the enactment of new or amended tax laws.\nUnder the asset and liability method, valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified, we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe main factors that we consider include:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> cumulative earnings or losses in recent years, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> expected earnings or losses in future years;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and earnings levels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record deferred income tax benefits for all tax years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date about the ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets or tax positions. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a future tax benefit will be sustained, our policy is to record the largest amount of income tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that an income tax benefit will not be sustained in the future, we do not recognize a deferred tax benefit in our financial statements. We record interest and penalties, net of any applicable tax benefit, related to income taxes, if any, as a component of the provision for income taxes when applicable.\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the use of the separate return method of accounting for income taxes that we used during the carve-out period and for information on the projected impact of the new tax laws.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. This ASU instead permits an entity to recognize goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, to the extent this amount does not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The new guidance continues to allow an entity to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment indicators in lieu of a quantitative assessment in certain situations. The ASU is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which was issued to simplify some of the accounting guidance for share-based compensation. Among the areas impacted by the amendments in this ASU are the accounting for income taxes related to share-based payments, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU had no material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends the accounting for leases and requires the rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and labilities on the balance sheet. Recognition of these assets and liabilities will have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients. We expect to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019. We are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our policies, procedures, financial disclosures and control framework. We are additionally evaluating any modifications to our leasing strategy in response to the requirements of this standard.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides for a single comprehensive principles-based model for the recognition of revenue across all industries using a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The new standard significantly expands disclosures about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows, as well as certain additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and permits the use of either a full or modified retrospective approach upon adoption. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and during the fourth quarter of 2017 completed our evaluation of the resulting impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A significant portion of the adoption of this ASU was the process of evaluating the characteristics of patient accounts receivable portfolios to ensure that when evaluated under the new standard it would result in a materially consistent revenue amount for such portfolios as if each patient account was evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis. A component of this evaluation was the estimation of what portion of an insured patient's account will ultimately be due from the patient as a co-payment or deductible and of that amount what will ultimately be collectible. We updated our processes to accommodate this estimate and recorded a change in estimate to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017, which is further discussed above in our critical accounting policies on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts. We completed our evaluation of the impact on our results of operations as of the fourth quarter 2017 and we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations on a prospective basis, other than the impact of the presentation of the income statement, as the provision for bad debts will be recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and will not be presented as a separate line item.\nResults of Operations\nWe have summarized our results of operations, including certain financial and operating data, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for the sequential quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 on a comparative basis below. The definitions of certain terms used throughout the remainder of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d follows:\nConsolidated and Combined. Our financial statements include amounts and disclosures related to the stand-alone financial statements and accounting records of QHC after the Spin-off ( consolidated\u201d) in combination with amounts and disclosures that have been derived for the businesses comprising QHC from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of CHS for the periods prior to the completion of the Spin-off ( combined\u201d). Any references to our financial statements, financial data and operating data refer to our consolidated and combined financial statements unless otherwise noted.\nSame-facility. Same-facility financial and operating data, as presented in the comparative discussions herein, excludes hospitals that were sold prior to and as of the end of the current reporting period. Our same-facility operating results for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2017, which are reported herein, have been\nadjusted to exclude the operating results of Sandhills, Barrow, Cherokee, Trinity, Lock Haven, Sunbury and L.V. Stabler, which we sold on December 1, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and October 31, 2017, respectively.\nContinuing Hospitals Group. The Continuing Hospitals Group consists of twenty-four hospitals which we currently intend to continue to operate as part of our core business.\nDivestitures Group. The Divestitures Group, as of December 31, 2017, includes all hospitals that had been divested by us since the Spin-off through December 31, 2017. The Divestitures Group includes Barrow, Sandhills, Cherokee, Trinity, Lock Haven, Sunbury and L.V. Stabler. This group of hospitals has certain ongoing operations during the wind-down period related to the assets and liabilities which were not part of the hospital sale, which typically include accounts receivable and third-party receivables and payables.\nPotential Divestitures Group. The Potential Divestitures Group, as of December 31, 2017, includes seven hospitals that management has identified for potential divestiture over the next twelve to twenty-four month period. We continually evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture which could result in changes to the hospitals included in this group in future periods.\nLicensed Beds. Licensed beds are the number of beds for which the appropriate state agency licenses a hospital, regardless of whether the beds are actually available for patient use.\nAdmissions. Admissions represent the number of patients admitted for inpatient services.\nAdjusted Admissions. Adjusted admissions is computed by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues.\nEmergency room visits. Emergency room visits represent the number of patients registered and treated in our emergency rooms.\nMedicare case mix index. Medicare case mix index is a relative value assigned to a diagnosis-related group of patients that is used in determining the allocation of resources necessary to treat the patients in that group. Medicare case mix index is calculated as the average case mix index for all Medicare admissions during the period.\nHospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission. Hospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission is calculated as total paid employed and contract labor hours at both our hospitals and affiliated outpatient facilities divided by adjusted admissions. It is used by management as a measurement of productivity.\nDays revenue outstanding. Days revenue outstanding approximates the average collection period for patient accounts receivable. It is calculated by dividing net patient accounts receivable at the end of the period by average net operating revenues per day for the most recent three months. Net patient accounts receivable excludes the amounts reported as due from and to third-party payors related to final cost report settlements and state supplemental payment programs.\nEBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that consists of net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to add back the effect of certain legal, professional and settlement costs, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, net gain (loss) on sale of hospitals, transaction costs related to the Spin-off, post-spin headcount reductions and change in estimate related to collectability of patient accounts receivable. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to assess the operating performance of our hospital operations business and to make decisions on the allocation of resources. Additionally, management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in assessing our consolidated results of operations and in comparing our results of operations between periods.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of positive or negative EBITDA of the Divestitures Group. We present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures because management believes this measure provides investors and other users of our financial statements with additional information about how management assesses the results of operations.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, and further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of positive or negative EBITDA of the Potential Divestitures Group. We present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures because management believes this measure provides investors and other users of our financial statements with additional information about how management assesses the results of operations.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nA summary of our results of operations, both in dollars and as a

</tr>\n</table>\nNet operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $66.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting of a $58.5 million decrease in net patient revenues and a $7.8 million decrease in non-patient revenues. Our 2016 net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, included an $11.4 million negative impact to contractual allowances resulting from the change in estimate described below. Excluding this impact, net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts decreased $72.2 million, or 3.5%, consisting of a $135.8 million decline from the Divestitures Group, a $16.0 million decline in the Potential Divestitures Group and a $56.8 million increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group. The Continuing Hospitals Group included a $36.3 million increase from volumes, and a $20.5 million increase from payor rates, partially offset by a $15.4 million decrease in net operating revenues related to the California HQAF program. On a consolidated basis, admissions and adjusted admissions declined 7.1% and 7.5%, respectively, when comparing 2017 to 2016. For the Continuing Hospitals Group, admissions and adjusted admissions increased 0.9% and 2.2%, respectively, when comparing 2017 to 2016. Non-patient revenues decreased $7.8 million when comparing 2017 to 2016, primarily related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted contractual allowances in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.\nProvision for Bad Debts\nThe provision for bad debts decreased $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease related to the Divestitures Group.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.\nSalaries and Benefits\nThe following table provides information related to our salaries and benefits expenses (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,034,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,057,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (22,322\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 942,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 968,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (26,631\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and benefits decreased $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Salaries and benefits declined $60.4 million related to the Divestitures Group and $1.7 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group. These declines were offset by an increase of $35.8 million in salaries and benefits of the Continuing Hospitals Group primarily resulting from increased salaries at our clinics due to physician recruitment efforts and an increase in corporate salaries of $13.1 million as we had a full year of corporate salaries in 2017 compared to eight months in 2016. For the four months in 2016 prior to the Spin-off, management fees were allocated to QHC for corporate functions of CHS and were included in other operating expenses. The increase in corporate salaries and benefits as a result of the Spin-off was partially offset by a reduction in corporate and QHR salaries and benefits in 2017 due to headcount reductions in November 2016 and May 2017. Included in salaries and benefits expenses related to corporate functions were $10.0 million and $7.4 million of stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nSupplies\nThe following table provides information related to our supplies expense (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 250,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,116\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplies expense decreased $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

As a percentage of net operating revenues, other operating expenses were 29.9% and 30.3% in these respective years. Other operating expenses declined $11.8 million related to management fees from Parent that existed in 2016 with no comparable other operating expenses in 2017. The comparable costs are primarily included in salaries and benefits following the Spin-off. Other\noperating expenses also declined $41.7 million related to the Divestitures Group, and increased $3.8 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and $20.5 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Potential Divestitures Group and the Continuing Hospitals Group was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in medical specialist fees resulting from contracts related to emergency room services and subsidies to various third parties, including hospitalists and a $8.2 million increase in taxes and insurance primarily related to $3.2 million of New Mexico gross receipts tax refunds received in 2016 with no comparable tax refund in 2017. We are disputing in arbitration, among other issues and actions, certain charges and lack of performance of various obligations under the transition services agreements with our former Parent.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $35.1 million to $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Depreciation and amortization decreased $9.3 million related to the Divestitures Group. In addition, depreciation and amortization is lower in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to impairment recorded in 2017 and 2016 reducing the asset bases of our long-lived assets and due to the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization related to long-lived assets classified as held for sale.\nRent\nRent expense increased $0.3 million to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.4% and 2.3% in these respective years.\nElectronic Health Records Incentives Earned\nElectronic health records incentives earned decreased $6.8 million to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in activity as we move closer toward full implementation of EHR. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on EHR.\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\nLegal, professional and settlement costs decreased $1.3 million to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our costs in 2017 primarily related to investigation costs incurred by our Board related to litigation related to the Spin-off and the costs in 2016 primarily related to a QHR legal claim. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on legal matters.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $47.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill. In the first quarter of 2017, we classified certain additional hospitals as held for sale. As part of this process, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of all our hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of our hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis. In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded impairment totaling $3.3 million, consisting of $1.1 million related to property and equipment, $0.8 million related to capitalized software costs and $1.4 million related to goodwill. In the second quarter of 2017, we recognized $12.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets of certain hospitals which we have identified as potential divestiture candidates and for which we have received letters of intent. In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized $5.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill of certain hospitals which we have identified as potential divestiture candidates and for which we have received letters of intent, consisting of $3.7 million related to property and equipment and $0.6 million related to goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized $25.8 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill of potential divestiture candidates, consisting of $23.7 million related to property and equipment and $2.1 million related to capitalized software costs. See - Overview - 2017 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2017.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $291.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill, consisting of $145.6 million to property and equipment, $18.9 million to capitalized software costs, $2.4 million to medical license assets and $125.0 million to goodwill. As a result of management's decision in the second quarter following the Spin-off to divest certain hospitals and evaluate additional hospitals for potential divestiture, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and additionally identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to our hospital operations reporting unit in this quarter. We concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. As a result of all of the above, we recorded impairment in the second quarter of 2016 of $41.0 million related to property and equipment, $4.4 million related to capitalized software costs and $205.0 million related to goodwill, which included a preliminary step two goodwill impairment estimate. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our goodwill impairment estimate by recording a downward adjustment of $80 million, but recorded additional impairment of $71.9 million related to property and equipment and $10.8 million related to capitalized software costs in connection with finalizing our step two goodwill impairment evaluation. Additionally, due to additional indicators of impairment resulting from continued operating losses at certain of our hospitals in the second half of 2016, we recorded further impairment of $32.7 million related to property and equipment, $3.7 million related to capitalized software costs and $2.4 million\nrelated to medical licenses associated with our hospital operations business in the fourth quarter of 2017. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.\nLoss (Gain) on Sale of Hospitals, Net\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a $5.2 million net gain on the sale of hospitals primarily related to the $5.3 million gain on the sale of Trinity in the second quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $2.2 million net loss on the sale of two hospitals, consisting of $1.2 million related to Barrow and $1.0 million related to Sandhills. We are committed to our business strategy, which includes actively engaging in initiatives, among others, to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins. We have divested a total of seven hospitals in 2017 and 2016.

Following the Spin-off, interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. The effective interest rates for our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes were approximately 8.8% and 12.9%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 7.7% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our Senior Credit Facility was amended on April 11, 2017, which increased the interest rate terms on our Term Loan Facility. Additionally, for the four month period in 2016 prior to the Spin-off, we were charged interest on the amounts due to CHS at various rates ranging from 4% to 7%. Interest computations on this indebtedness were based on the outstanding balance of Due to Parent, net at the end of each month. This debt with CHS was extinguished on April 29, 2016.

The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years after December 31, 2017. As a direct result of changes in tax law due to the passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a total tax benefit of $24.0 million during 2017 which is composed of two amounts: a tax benefit of $10.9 million in deferred income tax expense for the net change in our deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% tax rate, and a $13.1 million tax benefit in deferred income tax expense for the reduction in valuation allowance attributable to the change in net realizability of deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also provides for acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018. These prospective changes include an increased limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation, a limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, new rules surrounding meals and entertainment expense and fines and penalties. Also, while net operating losses generated in the future may by carried forward indefinitely under the new law, there is a limitation on the amount that may be used in any given year. The Tax Act may also have an impact on projected future taxable income that could further affect valuation allowance considerations. In addition to the federal law, we await guidance from the states in which we file on how components of the Tax Act may be treated in these jurisdictions. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nThe benefit from income taxes was $21.9 million and $53.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 16.3% and 13.5% for these respective periods. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to the Tax Act which provided for the recognition of a deferred tax benefit on both the release of valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets not previously expected to be realized in addition to statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1.8 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net operating revenues, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was 0.1% and 0.2% in these respective years. Our noncontrolling interest partnership associated with Trinity was dissolved in connection with the sale of this hospital in the second quarter of 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year

ended December 31, 2015, consisting of a $40.1 million decrease in net patient revenues and an $8.8 million decrease in non-patient revenues. Our 2016 net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, included an $11.4 million negative impact to contractual allowances resulting from the change in estimate described below. In addition, our net patient revenues in 2015 were unfavorably impacted by an $11.1 million Illinois cost report settlement reversal that was initially recorded as a favorable adjustment to contractual allowances in 2014 and then reversed in 2015 due to contract negotiations finalized in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding both of these impacts, net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, decreased $17.7 million, or 0.8%, in 2016 when compared to 2015 consisting of a $21.5 million decline from the Divestitures Group and a $3.8 million increase in the Potential Divestitures Group. Net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, of the Continuing Hospitals Group decreased $0.1 million, consisting of an $18.3 million decrease from volumes, offset by an $18.2 million increase from payor rates. On a consolidated basis, admissions and adjusted admissions declined 3.1% and 2.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the Continuing Hospitals Group, admissions and adjusted admissions decreased 2.6% and 1.3%, respectively, in 2016 when compared to 2015.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted contractual allowances in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.\nNon-patient revenues decreased $8.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015, consisting of $5.0 million related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business due to fewer management advisory and consulting services contracts in 2016 when compared to 2015 and $3.8 million of other income. We had other income of $2.2 million related to the receivables facility with CHS in 2015 with no comparable income in 2016. Our hospitals were removed from the CHS receivables facility in November 2015.\nProvision for Bad Debts\nThe provision for bad debts increased $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the $11.4 million change in estimate recorded as of December 31, 2016, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts. The provision for bad debts decreased $0.1 million related to the Divestitures Group. The remaining increase was due to a decline in the collectability of self-pay accounts receivable indicated by the most recent hindsight model.\nSalaries and Benefits\nThe following table provides information related to our salaries and benefits expenses (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,057,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,016,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 968,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 959,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,373\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,984\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 103.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and benefits increased $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to $29.2 million of corporate salaries and benefits in the eight month period following the Spin-off, which included $7.4 million of stock-based compensation. Prior to the Spin-off, management fees were allocated to QHC for corporate functions of CHS and were included in other operating expenses. Salaries and benefits declined $0.9 million related to the Divestitures Group, declined $2.2 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $9.6 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group primarily related to increased costs related to our self-insurance health claims and costs related to our clinic operations as a result of our physician recruiting efforts.\nSupplies\nThe following table provides information related to our supplies expense (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 258,639\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 249,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,099\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplies expense increased $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.

Other operating expenses increased $3.2 million related to the Divestitures Group, increased $3.5 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $11.3 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. Medical specialist fees increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 as a result of the renegotiated contracts related to emergency room services and subsidies to various third parties, including hospitalists. Taxes and insurance increased primarily due to a reduction in property tax credits in 2016 when compared to 2015. In 2016, we had $8.0 million of Illinois income tax credits and $3.2 million of New Mexico gross receipts tax refunds, which\ncompared to $13.1 million of Illinois income tax credits in 2015. In 2016, we incurred $0.9 million of expenses associated with New Mexico gross receipts tax refunds that were included in purchased services with no comparable fees in 2015. Management fees from Parent, which primarily consisted of costs for corporate salaries and benefits allocated from CHS, decreased in 2016 as it only includes the four months prior to the Spin-off. We entered into transition services agreements with CHS that were initiated on the Spin-off date and are comparable shared services to those received by us from CHS prior to the Spin-off. When comparing 2016 to 2015, our costs associated with the transition services agreements were $6.3 million higher than the comparable allocated costs from CHS.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.7 million to $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to $45.4 million of impairment to long-lived assets and the reclassification of certain property, equipment and capitalized software costs to held for sale as of June 30, 2016, which reduced depreciation and amortization in the second half of 2016. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.\nRent\nRent expense increased $1.2 million to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.3% and 2.2% in these respective years.\nElectronic Health Records Incentives Earned\nElectronic health records incentives earned decreased $14.3 million to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in activity as we move closer toward full implementation of EHR. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on EHR.\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\nLegal, professional and settlement costs of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to $4.6 million of costs associated with a QHR legal matter and $1.9 million of costs primarily associated with litigation related to the Spin-off. We did not have any comparable costs in 2015. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies - Commercial Litigations and Other Lawsuits in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our legal matters.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $291.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill, consisting of $145.6 million to property and equipment, $18.9 million to capitalized software costs, $2.4 million to medical license assets and $125.0 million to goodwill.\nDuring the second quarter following the Spin-off, we made the decision to classify certain hospitals as held for sale and evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture. Due to the increase in net operating losses associated with these hospitals, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and recorded $45.4 million of long-lived asset impairment in this quarter. In addition, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of the hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2015 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $5.0 million of goodwill impairment in this quarter. In this same quarter, we identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to the hospital operations reporting unit and concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. The primary indicators were declining market capitalization, as compared to the carrying value of equity, and a decrease in estimated future earnings of the hospital operations reporting unit. We performed a calculation of the overall fair value of this reporting unit in step one of the impairment test and concluded that the carrying value of our hospital operations reporting unit as of June 30, 2016 exceeded the estimated fair value. We performed a preliminary step two calculation of goodwill impairment to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of the hospital operations reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimated and recorded additional goodwill impairment of $200 million in the second quarter of 2016.\nFor step two goodwill impairment testing, we engaged a professional valuation firm to perform a hypothetical purchase price valuation of each of our hospitals utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date. The results of the third-party valuation, which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, indicated that the carrying values of certain of our individual hospitals exceeded their fair values. Considering these results to be an indicator of potential impairment and to assess whether any additional impairment of long-lived assets existed, we utilized a September 30, 2016 measurement date to perform an analysis of undiscounted cash flows for each hospital in which an indicator of impairment was identified. Based on the results of these analyses, we recorded impairment of $82.7 million related to long-lived assets at certain hospitals and a downward adjustment to our previously recorded goodwill impairment estimate of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net impact to our financial statements was $2.7 million of additional impairment in the fourth quarter of 2016 beyond the initial estimate of $200 million estimate recorded as the preliminary step-two calculation in the second quarter of 2016.\nIn addition to the above, we experienced a decline in operating results at several hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016. This led management to perform additional testing for impairment using a December 31, 2016 measurement date. As a result of this analysis, we recorded additional impairment of $38.8 million related to long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized impairment of $13.0 million to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets at seven of our hospitals to their estimated fair values. The impairment for 2015 was identified because of declining operating results and projections of future cash flows at these hospitals, which were caused by competitive and operational challenges specific to the markets in which these hospitals operate.\nLoss (Gain) on Sale of Hospitals, Net\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $2.2 million net loss on the sale of two hospitals, consisting of $1.2 million related to Barrow and $1.0 million related to Sandhills. We had no comparable hospital sales in 2015. We are committed to our business strategy, which includes actively engaging in initiatives, among others, to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins. See Note 4 - Divestitures in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the sales of these hospitals, which both occurred in the month of December 2016.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe following table provides information related to interest expense, net (in thousands):\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Credit Facility:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term Loan Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,719\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ABL Credit Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt issuance costs and discounts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other interest expense (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,132\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (400.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense, net, from long-term debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,329.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due to Parent, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,007\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (62,193\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 113,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the new debt structure put in place in connection with the Spin-off. Interest expense for the period following the Spin-off is calculated based on the terms of the Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. The effective interest rates for our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes were approximately 7.7% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Prior to the Spin-off, we were charged interest on our indebtedness with CHS at various rates ranging from 4% to 7%. Interest computations on this indebtedness were based on the outstanding balance of Due to Parent, net at the end of each month. This debt with CHS was extinguished on April 29, 2016, the Spin-off date. See Note 7 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe following table reconciles the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate (dollars in thousands):\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit from) income taxes at statutory federal tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (139,685\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (142,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (171\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,578\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (872\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,189\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-deductible goodwill and Spin-off costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in valuation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total provision for (benefit from) income taxes and effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (53,875\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,179\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur income tax benefit was $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our income tax expense was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates were 13.5% and 41.1% for these respective years. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to our 2016 pre-tax loss, recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be recognized, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the additional impact in 2016 of a greater proportion of non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax loss. These non-deductible expenses were primarily the non-deductible portions of our goodwill impairment and Spin-off costs. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the accompanying financial statements.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $0.9 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Our net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, increased $4.3 million, or 0.8%, consisting of a $52.3 million decline in the Divestitures Group, an $8.0 million decline in the Potential Divestitures Group and a $64.6 million increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group. Our net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, of the Continuing Hospitals Group include $29.9 million of revenues from the California HQAF program in 2017 as the program approval process by CMS for the 2017-2019 period was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which $22.5 million related to the first three quarters of 2017. Excluding both the California HQAF revenues of $22.5 million in the 2017 period related to the first three quarters of 2017 and the change in estimate of $11.4 million in the 2016 period, which impacted contractual allowances as described below, net patient revenues of the Continuing Hospitals Group increased $30.7 million, consisting of a $15.5 million increase from volumes and a $15.2 million increase from payor rates. Excluding these same items, net patient revenues per adjusted admission for the Continuing Hospitals Group would have increased 3.8%. On a consolidated basis, admissions and adjusted admissions declined 9.8% and 11.2%, respectively, when comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the same period in 2016. For the Continuing Hospitals Group, admissions and adjusted admissions increased 3.4% and 3.7%, respectively, when comparing the fourth quarter of 2017 to the same period in 2016.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted contractual allowances in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.\nNon-patient revenues decreased $1.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the 2016 period, primarily related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business.\nProvision for Bad Debts\nThe provision for bad debts increased $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. The provision for bad debts decreased $8.3 million related to the Divestitures Group, offset by an increase of $6.2 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and an increase of $5.1 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.\nSalaries and Benefits\nThe following table provides information related to our salaries and benefits expenses (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 268,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (15,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 242,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,758\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,244\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and benefits decreased $15.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. Salaries and benefits declined $25.3 million related to the Divestitures Group, $1.5 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and $4.2 million related to corporate and QHR salaries and benefits, which the latter was due to headcount reductions in November 2016 and May 2017. Included in salaries and benefits expenses related to corporate functions were $2.3 million and $2.8 million of stock-based compensation for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These declines were offset by an increase of $15.6 million in salaries and benefits of the Continuing Hospitals Group primarily resulting from increased salaries at our clinics due to physician recruitment efforts.\nSupplies\nThe following table provides information related to our supplies expense (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 63,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,897\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Supplies per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSupplies expense decreased $2.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. Supplies expense declined $6.9 million related to the Divestitures Group and $1.3 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group. Supplies expense of the Continuing Hospitals Group increased $5.4 million, primarily due to an increase in adjusted admissions of 3.7% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, which resulted in an increase in implant costs as a result of increased orthopedic surgeries.\nOther Operating Expenses\nThe following table provides information related to our other operating expenses (dollars in thousands):\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2017 vs 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> in %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchased services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,800\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medical specialist fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,225\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transition services agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,249\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repairs and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,730\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,228\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other miscellaneous operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,976\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,276\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6,607\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther operating expenses decreased $6.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net operating revenues, other operating expenses were 29.3% and 31.8% in these respective periods. Other operating expenses declined $17.3 million related to the Divestitures Group and $0.7 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group, partially offset by a $10.8 million increase related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group was primarily due to a $7.9 million increase in provider taxes associated with the California HQAF program, which was approved in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the 2017-2019 program period resulting in a full year of provider taxes being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to one quarter in the 2016 period. We are disputing in arbitration, among\nother issues and actions, certain charges and lack of performance of various obligations under the transition services agreements with our former Parent.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $7.7 million to $18.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $26.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily due to the overall reduction in our long-lived assets due to divestitures, impairment charges reducing the asset bases of our long-lived assets and the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization related to long-lived assets upon being reclassified as held for sale.\nRent\nRent expense increased $1.6 million to $13.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of a $0.9 million charge related to leased space we are no longer able to sub-lease and therefore have recognized the remaining portion of the lease obligation as rent expense in the 2017 period. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.6% and 2.3% for these respective periods.\nElectronic Health Records Incentives Earned\nElectronic health records incentives earned decreased $1.5 million to $0.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in activity as we move closer toward full implementation of EHR. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Electronic Health Records Incentives Earned in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on EHR.\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\nLegal, professional and settlement costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 included an adjustment to our prior quarter's expenses for various costs that were determined to be covered under our existing insurance policies. The net result of this adjustment was a credit of $(0.5) million of legal, professional and settlement costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, legal, professional and settlement costs were $1.2 million and primarily related to the shareholder class action lawsuit and costs associated with our dispute in arbitration, among other issues and actions, of certain charges and lack of performance of various obligations under the transition services agreements with our former Parent.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $25.8 million of impairment to long-lived assets including $23.7 million of property and equipment and $2.1 million of capitalized software costs related to certain hospitals which we have identified as potential divestiture candidates and for which we have received letters of intent.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $41.5 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill. This included a revision to our goodwill impairment estimate initially recorded in the second quarter of 2016, which was a downward adjustment of $80 million. This amount was offset by impairment of $71.9 million related to property and equipment and $10.8 million related to capitalized software costs in connection with finalizing our step two goodwill impairment evaluation. Additionally, due to additional indicators of impairment resulting from continued operating losses at certain of our hospitals in the second half of 2016, we recorded further impairment of $32.7 million related to property and equipment, $3.7 million related to capitalized software costs and $2.4 million related to medical licenses associated with our hospital operations business in the fourth quarter of 2016.\nSee Overview - 2017 Impairment and - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2017 and 2016.\nLoss (Gain) on Sale of Hospitals, Net\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a $0.1 million gain on the sale of hospitals, net primarily related to the sale of L.V.

Following the Spin-off, interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. The effective interest rates for our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes were approximately 8.8% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 7.7% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our Senior Credit Facility was amended on April 11, 2017, which increased the interest rate terms on our Term Loan Facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources below and Note 7 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years after December 31, 2017. As a direct result of changes in tax law due to the passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a total tax benefit of $24.0 million during 2017 which is composed of two amounts: a tax benefit of $10.9 million in deferred income tax expense for the net change in our deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% tax rate, and a $13.1 million tax benefit in deferred income tax expense for the reduction in valuation allowance attributable to the change in net realizability of deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also provides for acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018. These prospective changes include an increased limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation, a limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, new rules surrounding meals and entertainment expense and fines and penalties. Also, while net operating losses generated in the future may by carried forward indefinitely under the new law, there is a limitation on the amount that may be used in any given year. The Tax Act may also have an impact on projected future taxable income that could further affect valuation allowance considerations. In addition to the federal law, we await guidance from the states in which we file on how components of the Tax Act may be treated in these jurisdictions. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nThe benefit from income taxes was $21.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Our effective tax rates were 45.6% and 3.8% for these respective periods. The increase in our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of 2017 when compared to the same 2016 period was primarily due to the Tax Act which provided for the recognition of a deferred tax benefit on both the release of valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets not previously expected to be realized in addition to the statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $0.8 million and $0.6 million in the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net operating revenues, it was relatively flat, or 0.1% in both periods.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 (Unaudited)\nA

increase in net patient revenues and a $1.2 million increase in non-patient revenues. Our net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, increased $37.6 million, or 7.0%, consisting of an $18.6 million decline in the Divestitures Group, a $1.6 million increase in the Potential Divestitures Group and a $54.6 million increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group was impacted by CMS' approval of the California HQAF 2017-2019 program period which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 and resulted in a full year of program revenues being recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 with no comparable revenues in the third quarter. The total HQAF program revenues recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $29.9 million, which included $22.5 million related to the first three quarters of 2017. Excluding the impact of the California HQAF revenues of $29.9 million, net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, related to the Continuing Hospitals Group increased $24.7 million consisting of a $35.8 million increase from payor rates, partially offset by an $11.1 million decrease from volumes. Excluding the impact of the California HQAF program, consolidated net patient revenues per adjusted admission would have increased 8.5%. For the Continuing Hospitals Group, admissions and adjusted admissions increased 0.9% and decreased 2.6%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to the third quarter of 2017.\nProvision for Bad Debts\nThe provision for bad debts increased $23.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily due to the change in estimate, which is further described below. The provision for bad debts increased $1.5 million related to the Divestitures Group, increased $9.9 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $11.6 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the three months ended December 31, 2017.\nSalaries and Benefits\nThe following table provides information related to our salaries and benefits expenses (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 253,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 251,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 230,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 229,410\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations salaries and benefits per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,221\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Hospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 108.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSalaries and benefits were $253.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $251.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017.

Supplies expense declined $1.8 million related to the Divestitures Group, offset by increases of $2.2 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and $4.9 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. These increases were primarily due to increases in surgeries of 3.1% and 4.4% related to the Potential Divestitures Group and Continuing Hospitals Group, respectively, which increased implant costs. In addition, we incurred increased costs of $0.8 million in relation to inventory adjustments during the three months ended December 31, 2017 primarily due to adjustments for obsolete inventory.\nOther Operating Expenses\nThe following table provides information related to our other operating expenses (dollars in thousands):\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> September 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fourth Quarter vs Third Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> in %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchased services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,716\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,160\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Taxes and insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,023\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Medical specialist fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (19\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transition services agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repairs and maintenance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,166\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Utilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,774\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other miscellaneous operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 156,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145,357\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther operating expenses increased 11.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017. As a percentage of net operating revenues, other operating expenses were 29.3% and 29.2% in these respective periods. Other operating expenses declined $6.5 million related to the Divestitures Group, increased $1.7 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $14.7 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. This increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group was primarily due to $7.9 million of provider taxes recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the full year for the California HQAF program that was approved by CMS in the fourth quarter of 2017, of which only $2.0 million related to the fourth quarter. In addition, we recognized $7.8 million of Illinois income tax credits for the three months ended September 30, 2017 with no comparable reduction in expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017. We are disputing in arbitration, among other issues and actions, certain charges and lack of performance of various obligations under the transition services agreements with our former Parent.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.0 million to $18.7 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $20.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. We placed in service a portion of the capital expenditures for our new patient tower and expanded surgical capacity at McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center. This increase to depreciation was offset by lower depreciation and amortization resulting from our divestitures, impairment and assets classified as held for sale.\nRent\nRent expense increased $1.2 million to $13.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $12.4 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.6% and 2.5% for these respective periods.\nElectronic Health Records Incentives Earned\nElectronic health records incentives earned were $0.2 million and $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively. Our activity is decreasing as we move closer toward full implementation of EHR.\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\nLegal, professional and settlement costs decreased $2.6 million to $(0.5) million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Legal, professional and settlement costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 included an adjustment to our prior quarter's expenses for various costs that were determined to be covered under our existing insurance policies. The net result of this adjustment resulted in a credit of $(0.5) million of legal, professional and settlement costs for the three months ended December 31, 2017. These costs in each period primarily related to the shareholder class action lawsuit and costs associated with our dispute in arbitration, among other issues and actions, of certain charges and lack of performance of various obligations under the transition services agreements with our former Parent.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nWe recognized impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill of $25.8 million and $5.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively, related to hospitals in our Potential Divestitures Group, as previously discussed.\nLoss (Gain) on Sale of Hospitals, Net\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a $0.1 million gain on the sale of hospitals, net primarily related to the sale of L.V. Stabler. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, we recognized a $0.1 million loss on the sale of hospitals, net primarily related to the combined sale of Lock Haven and Sunbury.

We paid down $22.2 million of our Term Loan Facility in the fourth quarter of 2017 with proceeds from the sales of Lock Haven, Sunbury and L.V. Stabler.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years after December 31, 2017. As a direct result of changes in tax law due to the passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a total tax benefit of $24.0 million during 2017 which is composed of two amounts: a tax benefit of $10.9 million in deferred income tax expense for the net change in our deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% tax rate, and a $13.1 million tax benefit in deferred income tax expense for the reduction in valuation allowance attributable to the change in net realizability of deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also provides for acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018. These prospective changes include an increased limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation, a limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, new rules surrounding meals and entertainment expense and fines and penalties. Also, while net operating losses generated in the future may by carried forward indefinitely under the new law, there is a limitation on the amount that may be used in any given year. The Tax Act may also have an impact on projected future taxable income that could further affect valuation allowance considerations. In addition to the federal law, we await guidance from the states in which we file on how components of the Tax Act may be treated in these jurisdictions. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nThe benefit from income taxes was $21.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Our effective tax rates were 45.6% and 1.9% for these respective periods. The increase in our effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended September 30, 2017 was due to the Tax Act which provided for the recognition of a deferred tax benefit on both the release of valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets not previously expected to be realized in addition to statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%.\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $0.8 million and $0.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, respectively. As a percentage of net operating revenues, it was relatively flat, or 0.1% in both periods.\nQuarterly Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (Unaudited)\nThe following

sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, proceeds from divestitures and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities. We believe that these amounts will be adequate to service our existing debt and finance internal growth and fund capital expenditures over the next 12 months and into the foreseeable future. Borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are intended to be used for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Our cash flows are negatively impacted by the significant amount of interest expense associated with the high debt leverage put in place to effect the Spin-off. Interest payments were $125.8 million, $90.9 million and $98.3 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, two states in which we operate, California and Illinois, are historically slow payors on their Medicaid supplemental payment programs, and in the case of Illinois, the Medicaid managed care organizations and fee for service are also programs in which state reimbursements are typically slow. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received $31 million of approximately $50 million of 2015 and 2016 outstanding amounts from the California HQAF program. In this same quarter, we also received a total of $51 million of the approximate $65 million in arrears from Illinois Medicaid and state employee patients. As of December 31, 2017, receivables outstanding under the California and Illinois state supplemental programs were $48.4 million and $22.9 million, respectively.\nOur business strategy includes an ongoing strategic review of our hospitals based on analysis of financial performance, current competitive conditions, expected demographic trends, joint venture opportunities, capital allocation requirements and specific state\nreimbursements and payment methodologies. As part of this strategy, we are actively engaging in initiatives, among others, to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins. As of December 31, 2017, we had combined proceeds of $45.9 million from the sale of five hospitals in 2017 and two hospitals in 2016, which have been used to pay down $44.4 million on our Term Loan Facility. We have targeted an additional seven hospitals that we intend to divest or close in the next twelve to twenty-four months from December 31, 2017. Of the seven targeted hospitals, we have closed one hospital in February 2018 and sold one hospital on March 1, 2018. See - Overview - Business Strategy Summary\u201d above for additional information on our divestitures activities. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we experienced net operating losses of $65.3 million from the fourteen hospitals in the Divestitures Group and the Potential Divestitures Group.\nOn April 11, 2017, we executed the CS Amendment to, among other things, raise the maximum Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the CS Agreement, to 4.75x from 4.25x for the period July 1, 2017 to December 31, 2018 (which was previously 4.25x for the period July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018), at which point it drops to 4.00x for the remainder of the agreement. On March 14, 2018, we executed the CS Second Amendment with our Senior Credit Facility lenders to amend, among other things, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio to 4.75x beginning July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 and 5.00x beginning July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019, at which point it drops to 4.50x for the remainder of the agreement. The CS Amendment and the CS Second Amendment also provide for additional Consolidated EBITDA add backs under the covenant calculations for certain items. For additional details of the CS Amendment, see -Long-Term Debt\u201d below. We are actively engaged in initiatives to divest underperforming hospitals and outpatient service facilities, for which proceeds will be used to pay down the Term Loan under our Senior Credit Facility.\nStatements of Cash Flows\nPrior to the Spin-off, our cash activity was managed through Due to Parent, net under CHS' cash management program and interest on our indebtedness with CHS was accumulated in Due to Parent, net. Following the Spin-off, we own and manage our own cash depository and disbursement bank accounts and have borrowing capacity, as well as principal and interest obligations, under our new debt structure.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 66,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,116\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (38,267\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,146\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,879\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (48,541\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (64,950\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (395.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,838\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (44,187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $67.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $14.1 million decrease. This decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to interest payments on our indebtedness, which increased $34.9 million. In 2017, we made $125.8 million of interest payments, primarily associated with our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes, compared to $90.9 million in 2016. This amount was partially offset by favorable cash collections related to patient accounts receivable. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we collected $31 million of approximately $50 million related to 2015 and 2016 outstanding amounts from the California HQAF program and $51 million of approximately $65 million related to past due receivables from Illinois Medicaid and state employee patients. We additionally contracted with third-party companies and collected $13 million in the fourth quarter related to underpayments, denials and accounts with no collection follow-up to supplement CHS collection efforts under the transition service agreements. All other changes in operating assets and liabilities on a comparative basis for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were considered to be part of our normal business operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities was $38.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $73.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a $34.9 million decrease. This decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to an $18.4 million reduction in hospital capital expenditures and an increase of $18.3 million in proceeds from hospital divestitures. This decrease in capital expenditures was due to an overall reduction in capital spending at our hospitals due to budgetary constraints, a $4.4 million reduction in spending on the $105 million Springfield, Oregon hospital project and a $3.1 million reduction related to divested hospitals. In total, we divested five hospitals in 2017 and two hospitals in 2016. These amounts were partially offset by $1.1 million of increased costs for acquisitions of ancillary outpatient businesses in 2017 when compared to 2016.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $48.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $16.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, a $64.9 million decrease. In 2017, we paid down $37.3 million on our Term Loan Facility from proceeds of divestitures. We also paid $3.1 million of debt issuance costs associated with the April 2017 amendment to our Senior Credit Facility and paid $3.9 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest partners. In 2016,\nwe completed the financing transactions related to the Spin-off which resulted in cash inflow from borrowings under the Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes of $1.3 billion, a cash settlement payment of $1.2 billion related to the Due to Parent liability with CHS and cash outflow of $29.1 million for debt issuance costs related to the Spin-off financing transactions. Additionally, we paid $11.6 million on the Term Loan Facility, consisting of $7.2 million from the proceeds of the sale of Sandhills and $4.4 million in scheduled payments, and $2.9 million in distributions to noncontrolling interest partners in 2016. We had a net cash inflow of $25.2 million related to transactions with CHS which were processed through Due to Parent, net prior to the Spin-off with no comparable activity in 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nThe following table provides a summary of our cash flows (in thousands):\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 81,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 89.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,146\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (78,592\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,446\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,841\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (52.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,453\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 25,802\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $81.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $42.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of $38.2 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a $97.9 million decrease in net income for 2016 when compared to 2015, exclusive of the non-cash items that we add back in each respective year to calculate our operating cash flows. Net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the fluctuations in certain corporate allocations and other charges from CHS to us that were included in the computation of net income (loss), but settled as a financing activity in the statement of cash flows for periods prior to April 29, 2016, the Spin-off date. In addition, net cash provided by operating activities was impacted by a $136.1 million increase in the net change in operating assets and liabilities, exclusive of acquisitions and divestitures activity, in 2016 when compared to 2015. The primary drivers of this increase related to the Spin-off, including a $17.6 million increase in accounts payable, primarily due to our independent management of cash since the Spin-off date, $19.9 million of accrued interest in 2016 with no comparable accrual in 2015 due to our new debt structure and $22.8 million of increased allowances related to a change in estimate to reduce the carrying value of patient accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016. In 2015, we made $26.4 million of legal settlement payments. All other changes in operating assets and liabilities on a comparative basis for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were considered to be part of our normal business operations.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased $5.4 million to $73.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $78.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. Our expenditures for property and equipment increased $20.5 million in 2016 when compared to 2015. We incurred $38.5 million and $10.4 million of costs in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the patient tower and expanded surgical capacity construction project at our Springfield, Oregon hospital, which was the primary driver of the increase in capital expenditures in 2016. Cash proceeds from the sale of hospitals in 2016 related to Barrow and Sandhills. Payments for acquisitions in 2015 of $8.0 million related to the purchase of ancillary businesses at our existing hospitals.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $34.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2015. In connection with the Spin-off on April 29, 2016, we borrowed $880 million under the Term Loan Facility and issued $400 million of Senior Notes, reduced by $24.5 million of issuance discounts related to this debt. We paid $1.2 billion to CHS from the debt proceeds as part of the settlement of our Due to Parent, net liability with CHS. We made payments on the Term Loan Facility of $11.6 million in 2016, which included a $7.2 million pay down utilizing the net proceeds of the Sandhills divestiture. Our other debt payments primarily related to capital lease obligations, including the capital lease associated with our corporate office in 2016. The decrease in Due to Parent, net in 2016 related to activity for the first four months of the year and then the full settlement of this liability with CHS in connection with the Spin-off. The decrease of $224.8 million in the borrowings under the receivables facility with CHS in 2015 was offset in the change in Due to Parent, net with a corresponding receivable. This decrease also reflected the termination of our participation in CHS' receivable facility program as of November 2015.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for property, equipment and software were $68.4 million, $87.2 million and $68.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition, we had $6.8 million and $15.7 million of capital expenditures related to property and equipment accrued in accounts payable at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2017 decreased primarily due to budgetary constraints and partially due to our divestiture activity. Capital expenditures in 2016 increased primarily due to spending on the Springfield, Oregon project.\nWe are building a new patient tower and expanding the surgical capacity at McKenzie-Willamette Medical Center, our hospital in Springfield, Oregon. We incurred costs of $34.1 million, $38.5 million and $10.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to the project. As of December 31, 2017, we have incurred a total of $83.0 million of costs for this\nproject, of which $76.1 million was placed into service in the fourth quarter of 2017. The total estimated cost for this project, including equipment costs, is estimated to be approximately $105 million. The project is expected to be completed in late 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have capital commitments related to certain other renovation projects that are expected to begin and be completed in 2018. The total estimated costs for these projects is approximately $3.0 million.\nCapital Resources\nNet working capital was $220.8 million, $272.6 million and $334.0 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The $51.8 million decrease in net working capital in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to cash collections related to patient accounts receivable, timing of interest payments on the Term Loan Facility and a decrease in discretionary benefits. The $61.4 million decrease in net working capital for 2016 compared to 2015 primarily related to changes in cash management following the Spin-off, which increased our liabilities for accounts payable and accrued interest, partially offset by an increase in cash. In addition, we recorded a change in estimate to reduce the carrying value of patient accounts receivable and incurred liabilities related to the establishment of self-insurance reserves related to employee medical benefits, professional and general liability claims and workers' compensation claims in 2016 with no comparable amounts in 2015. Prior to the Spin-off, our cash from operations was swept to CHS through Due to Parent, net under their centralized cash management program.\nLong-Term Debt\nThe following table provides a summary of

Facility\nOn April 29, 2016, we entered into a credit agreement, among us, the lenders party thereto and Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent. On April 11, 2017, we executed an agreement with our Senior Credit Facility lenders to amend certain provisions of our Senior Credit Facility, as described below.\nThe CS Agreement initially provided for an $880 million senior secured term loan facility and a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility. The Term Loan Facility was issued at a discount of $17.6 million, or 98% of par value, and has a maturity date of April 29, 2022, subject to customary acceleration events and repayment, extension or refinancing. The Revolving Credit Facility has a maturity date of April 29, 2021, subject to certain customary acceleration events and repayment, extension or refinancing. The CS Amendment reduced the Revolving Credit Facility's borrowing capacity from $100 million to $87.5 million until December 31, 2017, at which time the borrowing capacity decreased to $75.0 million through maturity.\nThe CS Agreement contains customary covenants, including a maximum permitted Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as determined based on 12 month trailing Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the CS Agreement. On April 11, 2017, we executed the CS Amendment with our Senior Credit Facility lenders to amend the calculation of the Secured Net Leverage Ratio beginning July 1, 2017 through maturity, among other provisions. The CS Second Amendment, which was executed on March 14, 2018, amended the Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the period July 1, 2017 through maturity. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had Secured Net Leverage Ratios of 3.87 to 1.00 and 3.93 to 1.00, respectively, implying additional borrowing capacity of $193.3 million as of December 31, 2017.\nAfter giving effect to the CS Amendment and the CS Second Amendment, the maximum Secured Net Leverage Ratio permitted under the CS Agreement, as determined based on 12 month trailing Consolidated EBITDA and as defined in the CS Agreement, follows:\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maximum\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Secured Net\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Leverage Ratio\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period from January 1, 2017 to June 30, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.50 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.75 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period from July 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.00 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Period from January 1, 2020 and thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.50 to 1.00\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to amending the calculation of the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Maximum Secured Net Leverage Ratio, the CS Amendment and CS Second Amendment also affected other terms of the CS Agreement as follows:\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Through April 29, 2022, we are required to use asset sales proceeds to make mandatory redemptions under the Term Loan Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 281: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Through December 31, 2018, we may request to exercise Incremental Term Loan Commitments, as defined in the CS Agreement, only if the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, adjusted for the requested Incremental Term Loan borrowing, is below 3.35 to 1.00. After December 31, 2018, we may request to exercise Incremental Term Loan Commitments for the greater of $100 million or an amount which would produce a Secured Net Leverage Ratio of 3.35 to 1.00.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 282: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Through December 31, 2018, we are allowed to incur Permitted Additional Debt, as defined in the CS Agreement, as long as our Total Leverage Ratio, adjusted for the Permitted Additional Debt, is below 4.50 to 1.00. After December 31, 2018, we may incur Permitted Additional Debt, as long as our Total Leverage Ratio, adjusted for the Permitted Additional Debt, is below 5.50 to 1.00.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to the CS Amendment, interest under the Term Loan Facility accrued, at our option, at adjusted LIBOR, subject to statutory reserves and a floor of 1% plus 5.75%, or the alternate base rate plus 4.75%. Following the CS Amendment, interest under the Term Loan Facility accrues, at our option, at adjusted LIBOR, subject to statutory reserves and a floor of 1% plus 6.75%, or the alternate base rate plus 5.75%. The effective interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 8.8% as of December 31, 2017. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility accrues, at our option, at adjusted LIBOR, subject to statutory reserves and a floor of 0% plus 2.75%, or the alternate base rate plus 1.75%, and remains unchanged under the CS Amendment. The CS Second Amendment did not alter these provisions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings outstanding on the Revolving Credit Facility and had $10.2 million of letters of credit outstanding that were primarily related to the self-insured retention levels of professional and general liability and workers' compensation liability insurance and represent security for the payment of claims. As of December 31, 2017, we had borrowing capacity on our Revolving Credit Facility of $77.3 million.\nABL Credit Facility\nOn April 29, 2016, we entered into an ABL Credit Agreement (the UBS Agreement,\u201d and together with the CS Agreement, collectively, the Credit Agreements\u201d), among us, the lenders party thereto and UBS AG, Stamford Branch ( UBS\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent. The UBS Agreement provides for a $125 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2017, we had no borrowings outstanding on the ABL Credit Facility and borrowing capacity of $124 million.\nOn April 11, 2017, we executed an amendment to the UBS Agreement with its lender party thereto, which aligned the provisions of the UBS Agreement with the CS Amendment. There were no changes to the USB Agreement that impact our interest or covenant calculations associated with the ABL Credit Facility.\nThe ABL Credit Facility has a maturity date of April 29, 2021, subject to customary acceleration events and repayment, extension or refinancing. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility accrues, at our option, at a base rate or LIBOR, subject to statutory reserves and a floor of 0%, except that all swingline borrowings will accrue interest based on the base rate, plus an applicable margin determined by the average excess availability under the ABL Credit Facility for the fiscal quarter immediately preceding the date of determination. The applicable margin ranges from 1.75% to 2.25% for LIBOR advances and from 0.75% to 1.25% for base rate advances.\nThe ABL Credit Facility has a Covenant Trigger Event\u201d definition that requires us to maintain excess availability under the ABL Credit Facility equal to or greater than the greater of (i) $12.5 million and (ii) 10% of the aggregate commitments under the ABL Credit Facility. If a Covenant Trigger Event occurs, then we are required to maintain a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Ratio of 1.10 to 1.00 until such time that a Covenant Trigger Event is no longer continuing. In addition, if excess availability under the ABL Credit Facility were to fall below the greater of (i) 12.5% of the aggregate commitments under the ABL Credit Facility and (ii) $15.0 million, then a Cash Dominion Event\u201d would be triggered upon which the lenders could assume control of our cash.\nCredit Agreement Covenants\nIn addition to the specific covenants described above, the Credit Agreements contain customary negative covenants, which limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, make investments, transfer assets and merge or acquire assets, and make restricted payments, including dividends, distributions, and specified payments on other indebtedness. They include customary events of default, including payment defaults, material breaches of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, default on other material indebtedness, customary Employee Retirement Income Security Act events of default, bankruptcy and insolvency, material judgments, invalidity of liens on collateral, change of control or cessation of business. The Credit Agreements also contain customary affirmative covenants and representations and warranties.\nSenior Notes\nOn April 22, 2016, we issued $400 million aggregate principal amount of 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023, pursuant to the Indenture. The Senior Notes were issued at a discount of $6.9 million, or 1.734%, in a private placement and are senior unsecured obligations guaranteed on a senior basis by certain of our subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d). The Senior Notes mature on April 15, 2023 and bear interest at a rate of 11.625% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, which began on October 15, 2016. Interest on the Senior Notes accrues from the date of original issuance and is calculated on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months. The effective interest rate on the Senior Notes was 12.5% as of December 31, 2017.\nThe Indenture contains covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and certain of our subsidiaries' ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other restricted payments, make certain investments, create or incur certain liens, sell assets and subsidiary stock, transfer all or substantially all of our assets or enter into merger or consolidation transactions.\nOn May 17, 2017, we exchanged the 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the Initial Notes\u201d) in the aggregate principal amount of $400 million, which were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d), for a like principal amount of 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the Exchange Notes\u201d), which have been registered under the Securities Act. The Initial Notes were substantially identical to the Exchange Notes, except that the Exchange Notes are registered under the Securities Act and are not subject to the transfer restrictions and certain registration rights agreement provisions applicable to the Initial Notes.\nOn and after April 15, 2019, we are entitled, at our option, to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption prices, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The redemption prices are expressed as a percentage of the principal amount on the redemption date.

These agreements include, among others, a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. We also entered into various transition services agreements that were established by CHS and that define agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to QHC. The transition services agreements generally have five year terms expiring on April 29, 2021, and include, among others, the provision for services related to information technology, payroll\nprocessing, certain human resources functions, patient eligibility screening, billing, collections and other revenue management services. Our future cash obligations related to these agreements are based on certain fixed and variable factors, as defined by each agreement, and include factors such as total cash collections, labor costs and employee headcount, which are used to determine the fees charged to us under the agreements each period. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our agreements with CHS. The obligations associated with these agreements are not included in the table above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $10.2 million of letters of credit outstanding that were primarily related to the self-insured retention level of professional and general liability insurance and workers' compensation liability insurance as security for the payment of claims.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we operate one hospital under an operating lease obligation for the land and building. We utilize the same operating strategies to improve operations at this hospital as we do at those hospitals that we own or lease under capital lease arrangements. The term of this hospital operating lease expires in June 2022, not including lease extension options. As of December 31, 2017, the total obligation for the remainder of this lease, not including lease extension options, was $12.8 million.\nRedeemable and Non-Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nOur financial statements include all assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of less than 100% owned entities that we control. Accordingly, we have recorded noncontrolling interests in the earnings and equity of such entities. Certain of our consolidated subsidiaries have noncontrolling physician ownership interests with redemption features that require us to deliver cash upon the occurrence of certain events outside our control, such as the retirement, death, or disability of a physician-owner. We record the carrying amount of redeemable noncontrolling interests at the greater of: (1) the initial carrying amount increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interests' share of cumulative net income (loss), net of cumulative amounts distributed, if any, or (2) the redemption value. As of December 31, 2017, we had redeemable noncontrolling interests of $2.3 million and non-redeemable noncontrolling interests of $14.0 million that are included in our balance sheet.\nInflation\nThe healthcare industry is labor intensive. Salaries, benefits and other labor-related costs increase during periods of inflation and periods of labor shortages for nurses and other medical staff, which may differ depending on the geographic area in which a hospital is located. In addition, the Affordable Care Act is subject to ongoing revisions and possible repeal and replacement, which may lead to substantially higher costs to us related to providing employee medical benefits. We are also exposed to rising costs for medical supplies and drugs due to inflationary pressures on our suppliers, including our group purchasing organization. We have implemented cost control measures to monitor and manage the impact of rising operating costs and expenses on our operating margins, including, among others, the reduction of costs in non-labor intensive categories. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to adequately offset the impact that any future increases in labor costs, employee medical benefit costs or other operating costs and expenses may have on our business which could adversely impact our operating margins in the future.", "item_7_truncated": " \u2022 the efforts of healthcare insurers, providers, large employer groups and others to contain healthcare costs, including the trend toward treatment of patients in less acute or specialty healthcare settings and the increased emphasis on value-based purchasing; \n \u2022 the extent to which regulatory and economic changes occur in Illinois, where a material portion of our revenues are concentrated; \nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2016 vs 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change in %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit from) income taxes at statutory federal tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (139,685\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (142,499\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,749\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (171\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (47,578\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (income) loss attributable to noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (872\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,189\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-deductible goodwill and Spin-off costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in valuation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 94,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (23.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (41.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total provision for (benefit from) income taxes and effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (53,875\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,179\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPursuant to the HITECH Act, MACRA and other laws, HHS has established Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs to encourage hospitals and healthcare professionals to adopt certified EHR technology. Eligible hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology can receive incentive payments, while hospitals that fail to do so are subject to payment reductions. We incur both capital expenditures and operating expenses in connection with the implementation of EHR technology initiatives. The amount and timing of these expenditures does not directly correlate with the timing of the receipt of EHR payments or the recognition of EHR incentives as earned. We record EHR incentives in our statements of income as a reduction to our operating costs and expenses. As we move toward our full implementation of certified EHR technology, our EHR incentives are declining and will ultimately end. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our EHR incentives earned were $4.7 million, $11.5 million and $25.8 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will earn approximately $1.5 million of EHR incentives in 2018.\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>

This group of hospitals has certain ongoing operations during the wind-down period related to the assets and liabilities which were not part of the hospital sale, which typically include accounts receivable and third-party receivables and payables.\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (345,197\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 113,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 98,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (53,875\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,304\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 128,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (168,344\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 234,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal, professional and settlement costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,870\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on sale of hospitals, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,150\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction costs related to the Spin-off\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Post-spin headcount reductions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in estimate related to collectability of patient accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 162,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 263,667\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Negative EBITDA of divested hospitals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,407\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 270,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Negative (Positive) EBITDA of potential divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,637\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 264,437\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the Spin-off and effective as of the Spin-off date, we entered into certain agreements with CHS that at the time of Spin-off governed the allocation to us of various assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) that were previously part of CHS.

This ASU instead permits an entity to recognize goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, to the extent this amount does not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The new guidance continues to allow an entity to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment indicators in lieu of a quantitative assessment in certain situations. The ASU is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three Months Ended

The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and permits the use of either a full or modified retrospective approach upon adoption. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and during the fourth quarter of 2017 completed our evaluation of the resulting impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A significant portion of the adoption of this ASU was the process of evaluating the characteristics of patient accounts receivable portfolios to ensure that when evaluated under the new standard it would result in a materially consistent revenue amount for such portfolios as if each patient account was evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis. A component of this evaluation was the estimation of what portion of an insured patient's account will ultimately be due from the patient as a co-payment or deductible and of that amount what will ultimately be collectible. We updated our processes to accommodate this estimate and recorded a change in estimate to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017, which is further discussed above in our critical accounting policies on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts. We completed our evaluation of the impact on our results of operations as of the fourth quarter 2017 and we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations on a prospective basis, other than the impact of the presentation of the income statement, as the provision for bad debts will be recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and will not be presented as a separate line item.\nA summary of these agreements follows:\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMedicare case mix index.

portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. The amounts due to us under such programs are included in due from third-party payors on our balance sheets. Some of these programs have participation costs, referred to as fees or provider taxes. We record these costs in due to third-party payors on our balance sheets. After a state supplemental program is approved and fully authorized, we recognize the reimbursement payments due to us from state supplemental payment programs in the periods amounts are estimable and revenue collection is reasonably assured. These amounts are recorded in operating revenues as favorable contractual allowances and the costs we incur under these programs are recorded as other operating expenses.

December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Following the Spin-off, interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. The effective interest rates for our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes were approximately 8.8% and 12.9%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 7.7% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our Senior Credit Facility was amended on April 11, 2017, which increased the interest rate terms on our Term Loan Facility. Additionally, for the four month period in 2016 prior to the Spin-off, we were charged interest on the amounts due to CHS at various rates ranging from 4% to 7%. Interest computations on this indebtedness were based on the outstanding balance of Due to Parent, net at the end of each month. This debt with CHS was extinguished on April 29, 2016.

2016 decreased $48.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of a $40.1 million decrease in net patient revenues and an $8.8 million decrease in non-patient revenues. Our 2016 net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, included an $11.4 million negative impact to contractual allowances resulting from the change in estimate described below. In addition, our net patient revenues in 2015 were unfavorably impacted by an $11.1 million Illinois cost report settlement reversal that was initially recorded as a favorable adjustment to contractual allowances in 2014 and then reversed in 2015 due to contract negotiations finalized in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding both of these impacts, net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, decreased $17.7 million, or 0.8%, in 2016 when compared to 2015 consisting of a $21.5 million decline from the Divestitures Group and a $3.8 million increase in the Potential Divestitures Group. Net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, of the Continuing Hospitals Group decreased $0.1 million, consisting of an $18.3 million decrease from volumes, offset by an $18.2 million increase from payor rates. On a consolidated basis, admissions and adjusted admissions declined 3.1% and 2.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.

Our accompanying financial statements include amounts and disclosures for QHC that have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of CHS for the periods prior to the Spin-off in combination with the amounts and disclosures related to the stand-alone financial statements and accounting records of QHC after the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the carve-out of financial information from CHS.\nFor the periods prior to the Spin-off, CHS used a centralized approach to cash management and to finance its operations, which included the operations of QHC. For these periods, cash and cash equivalents were swept to the CHS corporate accounts and transactions between QHC and CHS were accounted for through Due to Parent, net. This liability to CHS was settled in full on the transaction date, in part by a cash payment to CHS of $1.2 billion funded with net proceeds from the debt issuances that occurred in connection with the Spin-off. The remainder of the liability was extinguished and reclassified as a capital contribution to QHC. See Note 11 - Equity in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the equity established in connection with the Spin-off. Following the Spin-off, we established our own depository and disbursement cash accounts with various banks and use a centralized approach to cash management.\nTable 212: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Licensed beds are the number of beds for which the appropriate state agency licenses a hospital, regardless of whether the beds are actually available for patient use.\nProvision for Bad Debts\nFor self-pay receivables, the total amount of contractual allowances, discounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces these receivables to their net carrying value was $545.8 million and $571.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If our self-pay receivables being pursued by outside collection agencies were included in both gross self-pay receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts above, the allowance for doubtful accounts related to self-pay receivables as a percentage of gross self-pay receivables would have been 94.5% and 92.1% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If our actual collection percentage differed by 1% from our estimated collection percentage as a result of a change in recoveries, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed $5.1 million. If we applied a 1% differential to our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts related to self-pay receivables as of December 31, 2017, our patient accounts receivable, net would have changed by $6.1 million.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates and judgments presented below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies that require estimates, but are limited to those that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts in our financial statements are appropriate. If actual results differ from these assumptions and considerations, the resulting impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOther operating expenses decreased $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net operating revenues, other operating expenses were 29.9% and 30.3% in these respective years. Other operating expenses declined $11.8 million related to management fees from Parent that existed in 2016 with no comparable other operating expenses in 2017. The comparable costs are primarily included in salaries and benefits following the Spin-off. Other\nAdjusted Admissions. Adjusted admissions is computed by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year. For our annual evaluation, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units utilizing two modeling approaches, a discounted cash flow model and an earnings multiple model. The discounted cash flow model applies a discount rate to our cash flow forecasts that is based on our best estimate of our weighted-average cost of capital. The earnings multiple model applies a market supported multiple to EBITDA. Both models are based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs and expenses as of the testing date. Additionally, the results of both models are reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization, which considers the amount a potential buyer would be required to pay, in the form of a control premium, to gain sufficient ownership to set policies, direct operations and control management decisions of our company.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $291.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill, consisting of $145.6 million to property and equipment, $18.9 million to capitalized software costs, $2.4 million to medical license assets and $125.0 million to goodwill.\nA portion of our reserves for workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims included on our balance sheets relates to incurred but not reported claims prior to the Spin-off. These claims were fully indemnified by CHS under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a result, we have a corresponding receivable from CHS related to these claims on our balance sheets. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies - Insurance Reserves in the accompanying financial statements for a table that summarizes the liabilities and receivables associated with our workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n \u2022 changes in reimbursement methodologies and rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or commercial payors, and the timeliness of reimbursement payments, including delays in certain states in which we operate; \nWe use a third-party automated contractual allowance system to calculate our contractual allowances each month. Contractual allowances are calculated utilizing historical paid claims data by payor source, which is uploaded into the system each month. The key assumptions used by the system to calculate the current period estimated contractual allowances are derived on a payor-specific basis from the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage and historical paid claims data. The automated contractual allowance system does not include patient account level information, as it estimates an average contractual allowance for each payor source. Due to the complexities involved in the contractual allowance estimates, actual reimbursement payments we receive from third-party payors could be different from the amounts we estimated and recorded. If the actual contractual reimbursement percentages by payor source differed by 1% from our estimated contractual reimbursement percentages, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed by $14.9 million. If we applied a 1% differential to our patient accounts receivable due from governmental, managed care and commercial third-party payors as of December 31, 2017, patient accounts receivable, net would have changed by $18.2 million.\nThe following table provides a summary of the impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\n \u2022 the ability to achieve operating and financial targets and to control the costs of providing services if patient volumes are lower than expected; \n \u2022 the risk factors included in Item 1A.

Our financial statements include amounts and disclosures related to the stand-alone financial statements and accounting records of QHC after the Spin-off ( consolidated\u201d) in combination with amounts and disclosures that have been derived for the businesses comprising QHC from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of CHS for the periods prior to the completion of the Spin-off ( combined\u201d). Any references to our financial statements, financial data and operating data refer to our consolidated and combined financial statements unless otherwise noted.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\n</td> </tr>\nAgreements with CHS Related to the Spin-off\n\nWe perform an ongoing strategic review of our hospitals based on an analysis of financial performance, current competitive conditions, expected demographic trends, joint venture opportunities and capital allocation requirements. We are actively engaging in initiatives to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins, among others. In 2016, we sold two hospitals and their affiliated entities for combined proceeds of $13.8 million. In 2017, we sold five hospitals and their affiliated entities for combined proceeds of $32.1 million. We have targeted an additional seven hospitals that we intend to divest or close within twelve to twenty-four months. We continually evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture which could result in changes to the hospitals included in this group in future periods. The seven targeted potential divestiture hospitals had net operating income (losses) of $(40.7) million, $(17.7) million and $(20.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nA summary of the major transition services agreements follows:\nOn June 30, 2017, we sold 231-bed Trinity Hospital of Augusta and its affiliated facilities ( Trinity\u201d), located in Augusta, Georgia, for $15.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $9.7 million, $9.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to Trinity. In addition to the above, we recorded a $5.2 million gain\nThe following table provides information related to our supplies expense (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nThe following table provides information related to our other operating expenses (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nThe following table reconciles the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate (dollars in thousands):\n\n \u2022 the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n \u2022 Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS for information technology infrastructure, support and maintenance. Services include, but are not limited to, operational support for various applications, oversight, maintenance and information technology support services, such as helpdesk, product support, network monitoring, data center operations, service ticket management and vendor relations. Fees are based on both a fixed charge for labor costs, as well as direct charges for all third-party vendor contracts entered into by CHS on QHC's behalf. \n \u2022 the impact of changes made to the Affordable Care Act, the potential for repeal or additional changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation, as well as changes in other federal, state or local laws or regulations affecting the healthcare industry; \nThe following table provides information related to our salaries and benefits expenses (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nOn February 1, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell 77-bed Clearview Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities ( Clearview'), located in Monroe, Georgia. We currently anticipate completing the sale of this hospital by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $1.2 million of impairment to Medicare licenses of Clearview during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\n\nIn addition to the above, we experienced a decline in operating results at several of our hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016. This led management to perform additional testing for impairment using a December 31, 2016 measurement date. As a result of this analysis, we recorded additional impairment of $38.8 million related to held for use assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The carrying values of long-lived assets, including those classified as held for sale, are reported in our balance sheet net of impairment as of December 31, 2016.\nA summary of our operating results, both in dollars and as a percentage of net operating revenues, follows (dollars in thousands):\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years after December 31, 2017. As a direct result of changes in tax law due to the passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a total tax benefit of $24.0 million during 2017 which is composed of two amounts: a tax benefit of $10.9 million in deferred income tax expense for the net change in our deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% tax rate, and a $13.1 million tax benefit in deferred income tax expense for the reduction in valuation allowance attributable to the change in net realizability of deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also provides for acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018. These prospective changes include an increased limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation, a limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, new rules surrounding meals and entertainment expense and fines and penalties. Also, while net operating losses generated in the future may by carried forward indefinitely under the new law, there is a limitation on the amount that may be used in any given year. The Tax Act may also have an impact on projected future taxable income that could further affect valuation allowance considerations. In addition to the federal law, we await guidance from the states in which we file on how components of the Tax Act may be treated in these jurisdictions. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nOn January 5, 2018, we announced plans to close Affinity Medical Center ( Affinity\u201d), located in Massillon, Ohio. Subsequent to January 5, 2018, our affiliates entered into an agreement with the City of Massillon related to the closure whereby all of the owned real property and a substantial majority of the related tangible assets located at the hospital will be transferred to the City of Massillon in exchange for nominal consideration and the assumption of certain ongoing real property lease obligations and equipment lease obligations. Operations ceased on February 11, 2018 and we currently anticipate that the asset transfer to the City of Massillon will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $16.1 million and $20.2 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Affinity during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.\n \u2022 our ability to attract and retain, at reasonable employment costs, qualified personnel, key management, physicians, nurses and other healthcare workers; \nIn connection with the Spin-off, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the Senior Notes\u201d) on April 22, 2016 and entered into a credit agreement on April 29, 2016, consisting of an $880 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), or on a combined basis referred to as the Senior Credit Facility.\u201d In addition, we entered into a $125 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The net offering proceeds of the Senior Notes, together with the net borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, were used to make a $1.2 billion payment from QHC to CHS and to pay our transaction and financing fees and expenses.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 the potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations, internal investigations, audits, and federal and state false claims act litigation and other legal proceedings, including the shareholder and creditor litigations against our company and certain of our officers and threats of litigation, as well as the significant costs and attention from management required to address such matters; \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe calculate our provision for income taxes and account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred income taxes during the year. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and the enactment of new or amended tax laws.\n</table>\n\nA summary of our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source follows (dollars in thousands):\n\noperating expenses also declined $41.7 million related to the Divestitures Group, and increased $3.8 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and $20.5 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Potential Divestitures Group and the Continuing Hospitals Group was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in medical specialist fees resulting from contracts related to emergency room services and subsidies to various third parties, including hospitalists and a $8.2 million increase in taxes and insurance primarily related to $3.2 million of New Mexico gross receipts tax refunds received in 2016 with no comparable tax refund in 2017. We are disputing in arbitration, among other issues and actions, certain charges and lack of performance of various obligations under the transition services agreements with our former Parent.\nAmounts we collect for medical treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental third-party payors are generally less than our standard billing rates. Our standard charges and reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of medical procedure performed and the geographical location of the hospital. Differences in our standard billing rates and the amounts we expect to collect from third-party payors are classified as contractual allowances. The reimbursements we ultimately receive as payments for services are determined for each patient instance of care, based on the contractual terms we negotiate with third-party payors or based on federal and state regulations related to governmental healthcare programs. Our contractual allowances are impacted by the timing and ability of CHS to monitor the classification and collection of our patient accounts receivable. Billings and collections are outsourced to CHS under the transition services agreements that were put in place by CHS in connection with the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on these agreements. Except for emergency department services, our policy is to determine the payment methodology with patients prior to when the services are performed. Self-pay and other payor discounts are incentives offered to uninsured or underinsured patients or other payors to reduce their costs of healthcare services.\n\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we owned or leased a diversified portfolio of 31 hospitals in rural and mid-sized markets, which are located in 15 states and have a total of 2,979 licensed beds. Our hospitals provide a broad range of hospital and outpatient healthcare services, including general and acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic services, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. For our hospital operations business, we are paid for our services by governmental agencies, private insurers and directly by the patients we serve. We also operate QHR, a leading hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business. For our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business, we are paid by the non-affiliated hospitals utilizing our services. Over 95% of our net operating revenues are attributable to our hospital operations business.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 (Unaudited)\n \u2022 cumulative earnings or losses in recent years, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items; \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Government Regulations\nThe California Department of Health Care Services implemented the HQAF Program, imposing a fee on certain general and acute care California hospitals. Revenues generated from these fees provide funding for the non-federal supplemental payments to California hospitals that serve California's Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. Under Phase IV of the program, covering the period from January 2014 through December 2016, and Phase V of the program, covering the period from January 2017 through June 2019, we recognized $22.0 million, $34.4 million and $31.5 million of operating revenues, net of provider taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs related to hospitals that have been divested decreased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRecent Divestiture Activity\nWe have summarized our results of operations, including certain financial and operating data, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for the sequential quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 on a comparative basis below. The definitions of certain terms used throughout the remainder of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d follows:\nRent expense increased $0.3 million to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.4% and 2.3% in these respective years.\nThe following table provides information on certain drivers of our\nInterest expense, net increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the new debt structure put in place in connection with the Spin-off. Interest expense for the period following the Spin-off is calculated based on the terms of the Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. The effective interest rates for our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes were approximately 7.7% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Prior to the Spin-off, we were charged interest on our indebtedness with CHS at various rates ranging from 4% to 7%. Interest computations on this indebtedness were based on the outstanding balance of Due to Parent, net at the end of each month. This debt with CHS was extinguished on April 29, 2016, the Spin-off date. See Note 7 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness.\nDays revenue outstanding related to patient accounts receivable, excluding amounts recorded as due from and due to third-party payors on our balance sheets, was 63 days and 68 days as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received $31 million of approximately $50 million of 2015 and 2016 outstanding amounts from the California HQAF program. In this same quarter, we also received a total of $51 million of the approximate $65 million in arrears from Illinois Medicaid and state employee patients. The portion of our allowance for doubtful accounts representing an adjustment for expected recoveries of self-pay receivables aged over 365 days that have been placed with outside collection agencies was 4 days as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table provides a summary of the sources and uses of cash directly related to our separation from CHS (in thousands):\n \u2022 our ability to utilize our income tax loss carryforwards and risks associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; \nThe following table provides information related to our net operating revenues (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nThe following table contains a summary of the major transactions to effect the Spin-off of QHC as a newly formed, independent company (dollars in thousands):\n\nOverview\n\n\nElectronic health records incentives earned decreased $6.8 million to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in activity as we move closer toward full implementation of EHR. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on EHR.\nFor step two goodwill impairment testing, we engaged a professional valuation firm to perform a hypothetical purchase price valuation of each of our hospitals utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date. The results of the third-party valuation, which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, indicated that the carrying values of certain of our individual hospitals exceeded their fair values. Considering these results to be an indicator of potential impairment and to assess whether any additional impairment of long-lived assets existed, we utilized a September 30, 2016 measurement date to perform an analysis of undiscounted cash flows for each hospital in which an indicator of impairment was identified. Based on the results of these analyses, we recorded impairment of $82.7 million related to long-lived assets at certain hospitals and a downward adjustment to our previously recorded goodwill impairment estimate of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net impact to our financial statements was $2.7 million of additional impairment in the fourth quarter of 2016 beyond the initial estimate of $200 million estimate recorded as the preliminary step-two calculation in the second quarter of 2016.\n \u2022 our ability to successfully make acquisitions or complete divestitures and the timing thereof, our ability to complete any such acquisitions or divestitures on desired terms or at all, and our ability to realize the intended benefits from any such acquisitions or divestitures; \n\n \u2022 the extent to which states support or implement changes to Medicaid programs, utilize healthcare insurance exchanges or alter the provision of healthcare to state residents through regulation or otherwise; \nThe following table provides a summary of the impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 subsequent to the Spin-off (in thousands):\nWe have a definitive agreement to sell another hospital in the Potential Divestitures Group, 77-bed Clearview Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities, located in Monroe, Georgia. We currently anticipate completing the sale of this hospital in the first quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 the timing and amount of cash flows related to the California HQAF Program, as well as the potential for retroactive adjustments for prior year payments; \nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1.8 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net operating revenues, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was 0.1% and 0.2% in these respective years. Our noncontrolling interest partnership associated with Trinity was dissolved in connection with the sale of this hospital in the second quarter of 2017.\nOur strategic review process is ongoing and we may be unable to divest or realize proceeds from the sale or closure of any or all hospitals we consider for divestiture. We may also be subject to impairment charges in the future as a result of our ongoing strategic review process.\nefforts in collecting the Company's accounts receivables, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage, among other things, could affect our collection levels and are considered in our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period. We also continually review our overall allowance adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections experience, revenue trends by payor classification and days revenue outstanding, the composition of self-pay receivables between pure self-pay patients and the patient responsibility portion of third-party insured receivables, and the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions.\nCollections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of CHS' billing and collection efforts, including their current policies on billings, accounts receivable payor classifications, collections, and our own efforts to further attempt collection. As previously stated, billings and collections are outsourced to CHS under the transition services agreements that were put in place with the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on these agreements. Significant changes in payor mix, centralized business office operations, including CHS'\nIncome Taxes\nSome of the matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that include words such as expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d thinks,\u201d and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nProvision for Bad Debts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $35.1 million to $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Depreciation and amortization decreased $9.3 million related to the Divestitures Group. In addition, depreciation and amortization is lower in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to impairment recorded in 2017 and 2016 reducing the asset bases of our long-lived assets and due to the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization related to long-lived assets classified as held for sale.\n\nLegal, professional and settlement costs of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to $4.6 million of costs associated with a QHR legal matter and $1.9 million of costs primarily associated with litigation related to the Spin-off. We did not have any comparable costs in 2015. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies - Commercial Litigations and Other Lawsuits in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our legal matters.\nOur income tax benefit was $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our income tax expense was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates were 13.5% and 41.1% for these respective years. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to our 2016 pre-tax loss, recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be recognized, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the additional impact in 2016 of a greater proportion of non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax loss. These non-deductible expenses were primarily the non-deductible portions of our goodwill impairment and Spin-off costs. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the accompanying financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Net\nPotential Divestitures Group. The Potential Divestitures Group, as of December 31, 2017, includes seven hospitals that management has identified for potential divestiture over the next twelve to twenty-four month period. We continually evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture which could result in changes to the hospitals included in this group in future periods.\n \u2022 any potential impairments in the carrying values of long-lived assets and goodwill or the shortening of the useful lives of long-lived assets; \nAdmissions. Admissions represent the number of patients admitted for inpatient services.\nOur hospital operations and hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services operations meet the criteria to be classified as reporting units for goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. There is a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. Step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit's carrying amount, including goodwill. If this test indicates the fair value is less than the carrying value, then step two is required. Step two is to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. When an indicator of potential impairment is identified in interim periods, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at such date.\n \u2022 the availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits; and \nThese factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 the success and long-term viability of healthcare insurance exchanges and potential changes to the beneficiary enrollment process; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a $5.2 million net gain on the sale of hospitals primarily related to the $5.3 million gain on the sale of Trinity in the second quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $2.2 million net loss on the sale of two hospitals, consisting of $1.2 million related to Barrow and $1.0 million related to Sandhills. We are committed to our business strategy, which includes actively engaging in initiatives, among others, to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins. We have divested a total of seven hospitals in 2017 and 2016. See Note 4 - Divestitures in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on divestitures.\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of due from and due to third-party payors (in thousands):\n \u2022 the impact of cyber-attacks or security breaches; \n \u2022 Employee Matters Agreement. This agreement governs certain compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the employees and non-employee directors of QHC and CHS. It also allocated liabilities and responsibilities relating to employment matters, employee compensation, employee benefit plans and other related matters as of the Spin-off date. \n \u2022 Tax Matters Agreement. This agreement governs respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of QHC and CHS after the Spin-off with respect to deferred tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures, to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nThe following table provides a summary of patient accounts receivable, before contractual allowances, discounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts, by payor source (dollars in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to add back the effect of certain legal, professional and settlement costs, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, net gain (loss) on sale of hospitals, transaction costs related to the Spin-off, post-spin headcount reductions and change in estimate related to collectability of patient accounts receivable. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to assess the operating performance of our hospital operations business and to make decisions on the allocation of resources. Additionally, management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in assessing our consolidated results of operations and in comparing our results of operations between periods.\n\nSame-facility. Same-facility financial and operating data, as presented in the comparative discussions herein, excludes hospitals that were sold prior to and as of the end of the current reporting period. Our same-facility operating results for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2017, which are reported herein, have been\nrelated to medical licenses associated with our hospital operations business in the fourth quarter of 2017. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.\nWe are currently engaged in preliminary discussions with CHS related to the transition of certain of our transition services agreements related to billing and collections and eligibility screening services. We are seeking to bring these services in-house; however, we are unable to provide any assurances as to the timing of such an agreement or whether such agreement will be reached.\nSalaries and benefits increased $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to $29.2 million of corporate salaries and benefits in the eight month period following the Spin-off, which included $7.4 million of stock-based compensation. Prior to the Spin-off, management fees were allocated to QHC for corporate functions of CHS and were included in other operating expenses. Salaries and benefits declined $0.9 million related to the Divestitures Group, declined $2.2 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $9.6 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group primarily related to increased costs related to our self-insurance health claims and costs related to our clinic operations as a result of our physician recruiting efforts.\n \u2022 expected earnings or losses in future years; \nSupplies expense increased $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Supplies expense increased $0.7 million related to the Divestitures Group, declined $0.8 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $8.8 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group was primarily due to the renegotiated contract with our group purchasing organization following the Spin-off, which resulted in a reduction in rebates and administrative fee reimbursements of $5.3 million in 2016 when compared to 2015.\nHospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission. Hospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission is calculated as total paid employed and contract labor hours at both our hospitals and affiliated outpatient facilities divided by adjusted admissions. It is used by management as a measurement of productivity.\nWe estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving a percentage of all self-pay patient receivables without regard to aging category, based on collection history. The allowance percentage is based on a model that considers historical write-off activity and is adjusted for expected recoveries and any anticipated changes in trends. Our ability to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts is not significantly impacted by the aging of accounts receivable as management believes that substantially all of the risk exists at the point in time such accounts are identified as self-pay. For our insured receivables, which are non-self-pay receivables, we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection rates for the uncontractualized portion of all accounts aging over 365 days from the date of patient discharge, reduced by an estimate for expected recoveries. Generally, these non-self-pay accounts receivable aged over 365 days represent an immaterial percentage of our total patient accounts receivable on our balance sheets. We believe that we collect substantially all of our third-party insured receivables, which include receivables from governmental agencies.\nThe following table reconciles the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate (dollars in thousands):\nOther Operating Expenses\nOn October 31, 2017, we sold 72-bed L.V. Stabler Memorial Hospital and its affiliated facilities ( L.V. Stabler\u201d), located in Greenville, Alabama, for proceeds of $2.8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $4.8 million, $5.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, related to L.V. Stabler. In addition to the above, we recorded less than $0.1 million loss on the sale for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $2.5 million and $2.9 million of related to L.V. Stabler in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recorded a total of $5.4 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of L.V. Stabler in the years ended 2016 and 2017.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairment of $47.3 million, $291.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively. See - Overview - 2017 Impairment and - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in these years.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we evaluated the fair value of hospitals classified as held for sale and evaluated other hospitals intended for potential divestiture. In connection with this evaluation, we recognized long-lived asset impairment of $25.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of $23.7 million of property and equipment and $2.1 million of intangible assets impairment. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we evaluated the fair value of hospitals classified as held for sale and evaluated other hospitals intended for potential divestiture. In connection with this evaluation, we recognized long-lived asset and goodwill impairment of $5.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017, which consisted of $3.7 million of property and equipment, $1.0 million of intangible assets and $0.6 million of goodwill impairment. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized $12.9 million of impairment to property and equipment of certain hospitals in our Potential Divestitures Group for which we have received letters of intent. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, management made a decision to classify certain additional hospitals as held for sale. In connection with this decision, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of the hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $3.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which consisted of $1.1 million of property and equipment, $0.8 million of intangible assets and $1.4 million of goodwill impairment.\nA summary of our results of operations, both in dollars and as a percentage of net operating revenues, follows (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 demographic changes; \n2016 Impairment\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nThe following table provides information related to interest expense, net (in thousands):\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $0.9 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net operating revenues, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was 0.2% and 0.1% in these respective years.\n \u2022 the failure to comply with governmental regulations; \nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted contractual allowances in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.\n\n\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\nElectronic Health Record Incentive Payments\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to patients at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities. Collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the patient financial responsibility portion of payments due from insured patients, generally deductibles and co-payments. Our policy is to verify the health insurance coverage of a patient prior to the procedure date for all medical treatment scheduled in advance. We do not verify insurance coverage in advance of treatment for walk-in and emergency room patients.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted contractual allowances in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.\n\nThe following table provides information related to our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table provides information related to our supplies expense (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\n\n \u2022 changes in medical or other technology; \nAlthough we believe that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant regulatory, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and may be beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance that our expectations will in fact occur and caution that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this filing. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, CHS made a non-cash capital contribution of $530.6 million and transferred $13.5 million of cash to us on the Spin-off date. The cash transfer consisted of an agreed upon $20.0 million for the initial funding of our working capital, reduced by $6.5 million for the difference in estimated and actual financing fees and expenses incurred at the closing of the Spin-off.\nSupplies expense decreased $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Supplies expense declined $14.7 million related to the Divestitures Group and $3.1 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group. Supplies expense of the Continuing Hospitals Group increased $9.9 million, primarily due to an increase in adjusted admissions of 2.2% for 2017 compared to 2016 which resulted from increased implant costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $291.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill, consisting of $145.6 million to property and equipment, $18.9 million to capitalized software costs, $2.4 million to medical license assets and $125.0 million to goodwill. As a result of management's decision in the second quarter following the Spin-off to divest certain hospitals and evaluate additional hospitals for potential divestiture, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and additionally identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to our hospital operations reporting unit in this quarter. We concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. As a result of all of the above, we recorded impairment in the second quarter of 2016 of $41.0 million related to property and equipment, $4.4 million related to capitalized software costs and $205.0 million related to goodwill, which included a preliminary step two goodwill impairment estimate. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our goodwill impairment estimate by recording a downward adjustment of $80 million, but recorded additional impairment of $71.9 million related to property and equipment and $10.8 million related to capitalized software costs in connection with finalizing our step two goodwill impairment evaluation. Additionally, due to additional indicators of impairment resulting from continued operating losses at certain of our hospitals in the second half of 2016, we recorded further impairment of $32.7 million related to property and equipment, $3.7 million related to capitalized software costs and $2.4 million\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nThe main factors that we consider include:\nWhenever an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets may be impaired, we project the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. If the projections indicate that the carrying values are not expected to be recovered, the assets are reduced to their estimated fair value based on a quoted market price, if available, or an estimated value based on valuation techniques available in the circumstances.\nOn March 1, 2018, we sold 70-bed Vista Medical Center West and its affiliated facilities ( Vista West\u201d), located in Waukegan, Illinois, for proceeds of $1.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax gains (losses) of $(2.3) million, $4.9 million, and $5.7 million respectively, related to Vista West. In addition to the above, we recorded $11.1 million and $4.1 million to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Vista West during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We do not expect the loss on sale of this hospital will be material, after consideration of the impairment recorded.\nThe following table provides information on certain drivers of our net operating revenues:\n \u2022 our ongoing ability to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology and recognize income for the related Medicare or Medicaid incentive payments, to the extent such payments have not expired; \nProvision for Bad Debts\nThe following table provides information on our net operating revenues (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\n \u2022 our ability to maintain certain accreditations at our existing facilities and any future facilities we may acquire; \nDays revenue outstanding. Days revenue outstanding approximates the average collection period for patient accounts receivable. It is calculated by dividing net patient accounts receivable at the end of the period by average net operating revenues per day for the most recent three months. Net patient accounts receivable excludes the amounts reported as due from and to third-party payors related to final cost report settlements and state supplemental payment programs.\nOn December 1, 2016, we sold 64-bed Sandhills Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities ( Sandhills\u201d), located in Hamlet, North Carolina, for $7.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included a pre-tax losses of $0.2 million, $6.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to Sandhills. In addition to the above, we recorded a $1.0 million net loss on the sale in the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $4.8 million related to Sandhills during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe provision for bad debts increased $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the $11.4 million change in estimate recorded as of December 31, 2016, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts. The provision for bad debts decreased $0.1 million related to the Divestitures Group. The remaining increase was due to a decline in the collectability of self-pay accounts receivable indicated by the most recent hindsight model.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $47.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill. In the first quarter of 2017, we classified certain additional hospitals as held for sale. As part of this process, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of all our hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of our hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis. In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded impairment totaling $3.3 million, consisting of $1.1 million related to property and equipment, $0.8 million related to capitalized software costs and $1.4 million related to goodwill. In the second quarter of 2017, we recognized $12.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets of certain hospitals which we have identified as potential divestiture candidates and for which we have received letters of intent. In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized $5.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill of certain hospitals which we have identified as potential divestiture candidates and for which we have received letters of intent, consisting of $3.7 million related to property and equipment and $0.6 million related to goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized $25.8 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill of potential divestiture candidates, consisting of $23.7 million related to property and equipment and $2.1 million related to capitalized software costs. See - Overview - 2017 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2017.\nCharity Care\nThe following table shows the portion of our Medicaid reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs (in thousands):\nSalaries and Benefits\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2016 and subsequent to the Spin-off, management made a decision to classify certain hospitals as held for sale and evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture. As a result, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and recorded $45.4 million of long-lived asset impairment in this quarter. In addition, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals we classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of our hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2015 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $5.0 million of goodwill impairment in this quarter. In this same quarter, we identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to our hospital operations reporting unit and concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. The primary indicators were our declining market capitalization, as compared to the carrying value of equity, and a decrease in estimated future earnings of our hospital operations reporting unit. We performed a calculation of the overall fair value of this reporting unit in step one of the impairment test and concluded that the carrying value of the hospital operations reporting unit as of June 30, 2016 exceeded its estimated fair value. We performed a preliminary step two calculation of goodwill impairment to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of the hospital operations reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimated and recorded additional goodwill impairment of $200 million in the second quarter of 2016.\n \u2022 our ability to obtain adequate levels of professional and general liability and workers' compensation liability insurance; and \n \u2022 the availability and terms of capital to fund acquisitions, replacement facilities or other capital expenditures; \nDuring the second quarter following the Spin-off, we made the decision to classify certain hospitals as held for sale and evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture. Due to the increase in net operating losses associated with these hospitals, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and recorded $45.4 million of long-lived asset impairment in this quarter. In addition, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of the hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2015 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $5.0 million of goodwill impairment in this quarter.

The primary indicators were declining market capitalization, as compared to the carrying value of equity, and a decrease in estimated future earnings of the hospital operations reporting unit. We performed a calculation of the overall fair value of this reporting unit in step one of the impairment test and concluded that the carrying value of our hospital operations reporting unit as of June 30, 2016 exceeded the estimated fair value. We performed a preliminary step two calculation of goodwill impairment to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of the hospital operations reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimated and recorded additional goodwill impairment of $200 million in the second quarter of 2016.\n\n \u2022 general economic and business conditions, both nationally and in the regions in which we operate; \nThe Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. However, there is considerable uncertainty with regard to the future of the Affordable Care Act, as the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the law, its implementation and its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. In addition, several private health insurers have withdrawn from or limited their participation in the healthcare insurance exchanges, and the presidential administration has taken steps, including ending cost-sharing subsidies that were previously available to insurers, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces. Healthcare reform initiatives, including efforts to change, alter the implementation of, or repeal the Affordable Care Act, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nRevenues\nContinuing Hospitals Group. The Continuing Hospitals Group consists of twenty-four hospitals which we currently intend to continue to operate as part of our core business.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, and further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of positive or negative EBITDA of the Potential Divestitures Group. We present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures because management believes this measure provides investors and other users of our financial statements with additional information about how management assesses the results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which was issued to simplify some of the accounting guidance for share-based compensation. Among the areas impacted by the amendments in this ASU are the accounting for income taxes related to share-based payments, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU had no material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOn March 1, 2018, we sold 70-bed Vista Medical Center West and its affiliated facilities, located in Waukegan, Illinois, for proceeds of $1.2 million.\nadjusted to exclude the operating results of Sandhills, Barrow, Cherokee, Trinity, Lock Haven, Sunbury and L.V. Stabler, which we sold on December 1, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and October 31, 2017, respectively.\nRent expense increased $1.2 million to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.3% and 2.2% in these respective years.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record deferred income tax benefits for all tax years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date about the ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets or tax positions. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a future tax benefit will be sustained, our policy is to record the largest amount of income tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that an income tax benefit will not be sustained in the future, we do not recognize a deferred tax benefit in our financial statements. We record interest and penalties, net of any applicable tax benefit, related to income taxes, if any, as a component of the provision for income taxes when applicable.\nIn addition to the above, we experienced a decline in operating results at several hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016. This led management to perform additional testing for impairment using a December 31, 2016 measurement date. As a result of this analysis, we recorded additional impairment of $38.8 million related to long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.\nWe generate revenues by providing healthcare services at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities to patients seeking medical treatment. Hospital revenues depend on, among other factors, inpatient occupancy and acuity levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges and negotiated reimbursement rates for the healthcare services provided. Our primary sources of payment for patient healthcare services are third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs, commercial insurance companies, other managed care programs, workers' compensation carriers and employers. Self-pay revenues are the portion of our revenues generated from providing healthcare services to patients who do not have health insurance coverage as well as the patient responsibility portion of charges that are not covered for an individual by a health insurance program or plan. We generate revenues related to our QHR business when hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services are provided. We report these revenues at their net realizable value. We generate other non-patient revenues primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.\n \u2022 changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including the impacts of adopting newly issued accounting standards; \n2017 Financial Overview\nOn September 30, 2017, we sold 70-bed Sunbury Community Hospital and its affiliated facilities ( Sunbury\u201d), located in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, and 47-bed Lock Haven Hospital and its affiliated facilities ( Lock Haven\u201d) located in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, for combined proceeds of $9.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $8.4 million, $12.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively, related to Sunbury and Lock Haven on a combined basis. In addition to the above, we recorded a $0.1 million loss on the sale for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $1.9 million, $12.7 million and $3.0 million related to Sunbury and Lock Haven during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recorded a total of $26.6 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Sunbury and Lock Haven from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017.\nAs part of the business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we maintain insurance exceeding a self-insured retention level for these types of claims. Our self-insurance reserves reflect the current estimate of all outstanding losses, including incurred but not reported losses, based on actuarial calculations as of period end. The loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future due to updated facts and circumstances. Insurance expense in the statements of income includes the actuarially determined estimates for losses in the current year, including claims incurred but not reported, the changes in estimates for losses in prior years based on actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections, the insurance premiums for losses related to policies obtained to cover amounts in excess of our self-insured retention levels, the administrative costs of the insurance programs, and interest expense related to the discounted portions of these liabilities. Our reserves for workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims are based on semi-annual actuarial calculations, which are discounted to present value and consider historical claims data, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The liabilities for self-insured claims are discounted based on our risk-free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the self-insured claims are incurred and projected to be paid.\nSalaries and benefits decreased $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Salaries and benefits declined $60.4 million related to the Divestitures Group and $1.7 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group. These declines were offset by an increase of $35.8 million in salaries and benefits of the Continuing Hospitals Group primarily resulting from increased salaries at our clinics due to physician recruitment efforts and an increase in corporate salaries of $13.1 million as we had a full year of corporate salaries in 2017 compared to eight months in 2016. For the four months in 2016 prior to the Spin-off, management fees were allocated to QHC for corporate functions of CHS and were included in other operating expenses. The increase in corporate salaries and benefits as a result of the Spin-off was partially offset by a reduction in corporate and QHR salaries and benefits in 2017 due to headcount reductions in November 2016 and May 2017. Included in salaries and benefits expenses related to corporate functions were $10.0 million and $7.4 million of stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nHealthcare Reform\n\nThe provision for bad debts decreased $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease related to the Divestitures Group.\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends the accounting for leases and requires the rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and labilities on the balance sheet. Recognition of these assets and liabilities will have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients. We expect to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019. We are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our policies, procedures, financial disclosures and control framework. We are additionally evaluating any modifications to our leasing strategy in response to the requirements of this standard.\nSupplies\nThe Spin-off\nCost report settlements under reimbursement programs with Medicare, Medicaid and other managed care plans are estimated and recorded in the period patient services are performed and any revisions to estimates of previous program reimbursements are recorded in subsequent periods until the final cost report settlements are determined. We account for cost report settlements in contractual allowances in our statements of income and record these amounts as due from and due to third-party payors on our balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, contractual allowance adjustments related to previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements favorably (unfavorably) impacted our net operating revenues by $2.0 million, $(5.8) million and $(15.1) million, respectively. The 2015 amount included the unfavorable impact of an $11.1 million Illinois cost report settlement in 2014 that was reversed in the second quarter of 2015 due to contract negotiations that were finalized in that quarter. Exclusive of this adjustment, our net operating revenues were favorably (unfavorably) impacted by $(4.0) million in 2015 for all other contractual allowance adjustments related to previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements.\nOur hospital operations business is highly regulated. We are required to comply with extensive, complicated and overlapping governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations govern every aspect of how our hospitals conduct their operations, including the service lines that must be offered for licensure as an acute care hospital, restrictions related to employing physicians, and requirements applicable to eligibility and payment structures under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in severe penalties including criminal penalties, civil sanctions, and the loss of our ability to qualify for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nIn addition to the agreements referenced above, we entered into certain transition services agreements and other ancillary agreements with CHS defining agreed upon services, as specified by each agreement, to be provided by CHS to us commencing on the Spin-off date. The agreements generally have terms of five years.\nNet operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $66.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, consisting of a $58.5 million decrease in net patient revenues and a $7.8 million decrease in non-patient revenues. Our 2016 net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, included an $11.4 million negative impact to contractual allowances resulting from the change in estimate described below. Excluding this impact, net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts decreased $72.2 million, or 3.5%, consisting of a $135.8 million decline from the Divestitures Group, a $16.0 million decline in the Potential Divestitures Group and a $56.8 million increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group. The Continuing Hospitals Group included a $36.3 million increase from volumes, and a $20.5 million increase from payor rates, partially offset by a $15.4 million decrease in net operating revenues related to the California HQAF program. On a consolidated basis, admissions and adjusted admissions declined 7.1% and 7.5%, respectively, when comparing 2017 to 2016. For the Continuing Hospitals Group, admissions and adjusted admissions increased 0.9% and 2.2%, respectively, when comparing 2017 to 2016. Non-patient revenues decreased $7.8 million when comparing 2017 to 2016, primarily related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business.\nOn April 29, 2016, CHS completed the Spin-off of 38 hospitals, including their affiliated outpatient facilities, and QHR to form Quorum Health Corporation through the distribution of 100% of QHC common stock to CHS stockholders of record on April 22, 2016 (the Record Date\u201d). Each CHS stockholder received a distribution of one share of QHC common stock for every four shares of CHS common stock held as of the Record Date, plus cash in lieu of fractional shares. Our common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol QHC\u201d on May 2, 2016.\n \u2022 Shared Services Centers Transition Services Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS related to billing and collections utilizing CHS shared services centers. Services include, but are not limited to, billing and receivables management, statement processing, denials management, cash posting, patient customer service, and credit balance and other account research. In addition, it provides for patient pre-arrival services, including pre-registration, insurance verification, scheduling and charge estimates. Fees are based on a percentage of cash collections each month. \nForward Looking Statements\nFor step two goodwill impairment testing, we engaged a professional valuation firm to perform a hypothetical purchase price valuation of each of our hospitals utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date. The results of the third-party valuation, which was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, indicated that the carrying values of certain of our individual hospitals exceeded their fair values. Considering these results to be an indicator of potential impairment and to assess whether any additional impairment of long-lived assets existed, we utilized a September 30, 2016 measurement date and the same professional valuation firm to perform an analysis of undiscounted cash flows for each hospital in which an indicator of impairment was identified. Based on the results of these analyses, we recorded impairment of $82.7 million related to long-lived assets at certain of our hospitals and a downward adjustment to our previously recorded goodwill impairment estimate of $80.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Our final assessment of goodwill impairment took into consideration the impairment adjustments to the carrying values of the hospital long-lived assets. The net impact to our financial statements was $2.7 million of additional impairment in the fourth quarter of 2016 beyond the initial estimate of $200 million recorded as the preliminary step-two calculation in the second quarter of 2016.\nUnder the asset and liability method, valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. We assess the realization of our deferred tax assets to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required. Based on all available evidence, both positive and negative, and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified, we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized.\nThe following table provides information on certain drivers of our net operating revenues:\nEBITDA. EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that consists of net income (loss) before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\n \u2022 increases in the amount and risk of collectability of patient accounts receivable, including lower collectability levels which may result from, among other things, self-pay growth and difficulties in collecting payments for which patients are responsible, including co-pays and deductibles; \nOn March 31, 2017, we sold 60-bed Cherokee Medical Center and its affiliated facilities ( Cherokee\u201d), located in Centre, Alabama, for $4.3 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $1.0 million, $5.0 million and $5.3 million, respectively, related to Cherokee. In addition to the above, we recorded a $0.2 million gain on the sale in the year ended December 31, 2017. We also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $3.9 million and $2.0 million related to Cherokee during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We have recorded a total of $6.9 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Cherokee from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017.\nContractual allowances are recorded in the period services are performed and the patient's method of payment is verified. Estimates for contractual allowances are subject to change, in large part, due to ongoing contract negotiations and regulatory changes, which is typical in the U.S. healthcare industry. Revisions to estimates for contractual allowances are recorded in the periods in which they become known and may be subject to further revisions. All hospital contractual allowance calculations are reviewed on a monthly basis by management to ensure reasonableness and accuracy.\ncompared to $13.1 million of Illinois income tax credits in 2015. In 2016, we incurred $0.9 million of expenses associated with New Mexico gross receipts tax refunds that were included in purchased services with no comparable fees in 2015. Management fees from Parent, which primarily consisted of costs for corporate salaries and benefits allocated from CHS, decreased in 2016 as it only includes the four months prior to the Spin-off. We entered into transition services agreements with CHS that were initiated on the Spin-off date and are comparable shared services to those received by us from CHS prior to the Spin-off. When comparing 2016 to 2015, our costs associated with the transition services agreements were $6.3 million higher than the comparable allocated costs from CHS.\nOur policy is to write off gross accounts receivable if the balance is under $10.00 or when such amounts are placed with outside collection agencies. We believe this policy accurately reflects our ongoing collection efforts and is consistent with practices within the U.S. healthcare industry. We had $474.3 million and $420.3 million of past due patient account balances at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, being pursued by secondary collection agencies, excluding accounts being pursued by PASI under the transition services agreement. We expect to collect less than 3%, net of estimated collection fees, of the amounts being pursued by these secondary collection agencies. As these amounts have been written-off, they are not included in our gross accounts receivable or our allowance for doubtful accounts. Collections of any account balances previously written off are recognized as a reduction to bad debt expense when received. However, we take into consideration estimated collections of these future amounts written-off in evaluating the reasonableness of our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nRevenues\nThe following table provides information related to interest expense, net (in thousands):\nThe statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, as presented herein, include expense allocations for certain corporate functions provided by CHS to QHC for the periods prior to the Spin-off, including, but not limited to, executive and divisional management, employee benefits administration, treasury, accounting, risk management, audit, legal, procurement, human resources, information technology support and other administrative support services. These expenses were allocated to QHC based on direct usage or benefit where identifiable, with the remainder allocated to QHC using ratios based on revenues, expenses or licensed beds. Following the Spin-off, we began performing corporate functions using internal resources or purchased services, certain of which are being provided by CHS pursuant to the transition services agreements and other ancillary agreements.\nThe following table provides information related to our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 our ability to manage effectively our arrangements with third-party vendors for key non-clinical business functions and services; \non the sale for the year ended December 31, 2017 and remitted $1.2 million of proceeds to the joint venture partners. We also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $33.9 million related to Trinity during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nItem 7.\nThe following table provides information related to our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source (dollars in thousands):\nIn the ordinary course of business, we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for hospital care. The related charges for those patients who are financially unable to pay that otherwise do not qualify for reimbursement from a governmental program are classified as charity care. We determine amounts that qualify for charity care primarily based on the patient's household income relative to the poverty level guidelines established by the federal government. Our policy is not to pursue collections for such amounts; therefore, the related charges are recorded in operating revenues at the standard billing rates and fully offset in contractual allowances in the same period.\nWe recorded total expenses under transition services agreements with CHS following the Spin-off combined with the allocations from CHS for these same services prior to the Spin-off of $63.5 million, $66.4 million, and $60.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNon-patient revenues decreased $8.8 million in 2016 compared to 2015, consisting of $5.0 million related to our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business due to fewer management advisory and consulting services contracts in 2016 when compared to 2015 and $3.8 million of other income. We had other income of $2.2 million related to the receivables facility with CHS in 2015 with no comparable income in 2016. Our hospitals were removed from the CHS receivables facility in November 2015.\nThe following table provides information related to our salaries and benefits expenses (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\n\nBasis of Presentation\n \u2022 the impact of certain outsourcing functions, and the ability of CHS, as provider of our billing and collection services pursuant to the transition services agreements, to timely and appropriately bill and collect; \nThe table above includes an $11.4 million change in estimate we recorded as of December 31, 2016 to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable due to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program. This change in estimate negatively impacted contractual allowances associated with Medicaid revenues. In addition, net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, declined $135.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to the seven hospitals we have divested.\nRevenues\nEmergency room visits. Emergency room visits represent the number of patients registered and treated in our emergency rooms.\nThe benefit from income taxes was $21.9 million and $53.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our effective tax rates were 16.3% and 13.5% for these respective periods. The increase in our effective tax rate in 2017 when compared to 2016 was primarily due to the Tax Act which provided for the recognition of a deferred tax benefit on both the release of valuation allowance related to certain deferred tax assets not previously expected to be realized in addition to statutory rate reduction from 35% to 21%.\nRules, regulations and laws imposed on the U.S. healthcare industry are subject to ongoing and frequent changes with little or no notice and are often interpreted and applied differently by various regulatory agencies with authority to enforce such requirements. Each change or conflicting interpretation may require us to make changes at our hospitals and other healthcare facilities related to aspects such as space usage, equipment, technology, staffing and service lines. We may also be required to revise or implement operating policies and procedures that were previously believed to be compliant. The cost of compliance with governmental laws and regulations is a significant component of our overall operating costs. Furthermore, these costs have been rising in recent years due to new regulatory requirements and increasing enforcement provisions. Management anticipates that compliance costs will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. The U.S. healthcare industry has seen a number of ongoing investigations related to patient referrals, physician recruiting and employment practices, cost reporting and billing practices, medical necessity of inpatient admissions, physician office leasing, laboratory and home healthcare services, physician ownership of hospitals and other healthcare providers, and joint ventures involving hospitals and physicians. Hospitals continue to be one of the primary focus areas of the OIG, DOJ and other governmental fraud and abuse regulatory authorities and programs.\n \u2022 the effects related to outbreaks of infectious diseases; \nRent\nOther operating expenses increased $11.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net operating revenues, other operating expenses were 30.2% and 29.0% in these respective years. Other operating expenses increased $3.2 million related to the Divestitures Group, increased $3.5 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $11.3 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. Medical specialist fees increased in 2016 when compared to 2015 as a result of the renegotiated contracts related to emergency room services and subsidies to various third parties, including hospitalists. Taxes and insurance increased primarily due to a reduction in property tax credits in 2016 when compared to 2015. In 2016, we had $8.0 million of Illinois income tax credits and $3.2 million of New Mexico gross receipts tax refunds, which\nThe table above includes $29.9 million of revenues from the California HQAF program in the 2017 period, of which $22.5 million related to the first three quarters of 2017, and an $11.4 million change in estimate in the 2016 period which impacted contractual allowances. Both of these items impacted Medicaid revenues.\n \u2022 the effects related to the continued implementation of the sequestration spending reductions and the potential for future deficit reduction legislation; \nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $10.7 million to $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $128.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to $45.4 million of impairment to long-lived assets and the reclassification of certain property, equipment and capitalized software costs to held for sale as of June 30, 2016, which reduced depreciation and amortization in the second half of 2016. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 the efforts of healthcare insurers, providers, large employer groups and others to contain healthcare costs, including the trend toward treatment of patients in less acute or specialty healthcare settings and the increased emphasis on value-based purchasing; \n \u2022 the extent to which regulatory and economic changes occur in Illinois, where a material portion of our revenues are concentrated; \nPursuant to the HITECH Act, MACRA and other laws, HHS has established Medicare and Medicaid incentive programs to encourage hospitals and healthcare professionals to adopt certified EHR technology. Eligible hospitals that demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology can receive incentive payments, while hospitals that fail to do so are subject to payment reductions. We incur both capital expenditures and operating expenses in connection with the implementation of EHR technology initiatives. The amount and timing of these expenditures does not directly correlate with the timing of the receipt of EHR payments or the recognition of EHR incentives as earned. We record EHR incentives in our statements of income as a reduction to our operating costs and expenses. As we move toward our full implementation of certified EHR technology, our EHR incentives are declining and will ultimately end. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our EHR incentives earned were $4.7 million, $11.5 million and $25.8 million, respectively. We anticipate that we will earn approximately $1.5 million of EHR incentives in 2018.\n\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nLoss (Gain) on Sale of Hospitals, Net\n \u2022 Receivables Collection Agreement ( PASI\u201d). This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS' wholly-owned subsidiary, PASI, which currently serves as a third-party collection agency to us related to accounts receivable collections of both active and bad debt accounts of QHC hospitals, including both receivables that existed as of the Spin-off date and those that have occurred during the operating period since the Spin-off date. Services include, but are not limited to, self-pay collections, insurance follow-up, collection letters and calls, payment arrangements, payment posting, dispute resolution and credit balance research. Fees are based on the type of service and are calculated based on a percentage of recoveries. \nDivestitures Group. The Divestitures Group, as of December 31, 2017, includes all hospitals that had been divested by us since the Spin-off through December 31, 2017. The Divestitures Group includes Barrow, Sandhills, Cherokee, Trinity, Lock Haven, Sunbury and L.V. Stabler. This group of hospitals has certain ongoing operations during the wind-down period related to the assets and liabilities which were not part of the hospital sale, which typically include accounts receivable and third-party receivables and payables.\nIn connection with the Spin-off and effective as of the Spin-off date, we entered into certain agreements with CHS that at the time of Spin-off governed the allocation to us of various assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) that were previously part of CHS. In addition, these agreements govern certain relationships and activities between QHC and CHS for a definitive period of time after the Spin-off date, as specified by each individual agreement.\n \u2022 Employee Service Center Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS related to payroll processing and human resources information systems ( HRIS\u201d) support. Fees are based on a fixed charge per employee headcount per month. \nWorkers' Compensation and Professional and General Liability Insurance Reserve\n\n \u2022 Eligibility Screening Services Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS for financial and program criteria screening related to Medicaid or other program eligibility for pure self-pay patients. Fees are based on a fixed charge for each hospital receiving services. \n \u2022 the impact of seasonal or severe weather conditions or earthquakes; \nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n\nIn connection with the Spin-off, certain agreements were established by CHS that govern and continue to govern matters related to the Spin-off. These agreements include, among others, a Separation and Distribution Agreement, a Tax Matters Agreement and an Employee Matters Agreement. Various transition services agreements were established by CHS that define agreed upon services to be provided by CHS to QHC. The transition services agreements generally have five-year terms and include, among others, the provision for services related to information technology, payroll processing, certain human resources functions, patient eligibility screening, billing, collections and other revenue management services.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOn January 5, 2018, we announced plans to close Affinity Medical Center ( Affinity\u201d) in Massillon, Ohio. Subsequent to January 5, 2018, our affiliates entered into an agreement with the City of Massillon related to the closure whereby all of the owned real property and a substantial majority of the related tangible assets located at the hospital will be transferred to the City of Massillon in exchange for nominal consideration and the assumption of certain ongoing real property lease obligations and equipment lease obligations. Operations ceased on February 11, 2018 and we currently anticipate the asset transfer to the City of Massillon will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $16.1 million and $20.2 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Affinity during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.\n \u2022 our ability, where appropriate, to enter into, maintain and comply with provider arrangements with payors and the terms of these arrangements, which may be impacted by the increasing consolidation of health insurers and managed care companies and vertical integration efforts involving payors and healthcare providers; \nLoss (Gain) on Sale of Hospitals, Net\nAll references to our financial statements, results of operations, financial condition, financial position, cash flows, liquidity, indebtedness and our business refer to the results of QHC derived from the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and the accompanying notes included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\u201d All references to our financial outlook refer to the anticipated unaudited consolidated results of QHC derived from management's best estimate as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other: Simplifying the Accounting for Goodwill Impairment, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating step two from the goodwill impairment test. This ASU instead permits an entity to recognize goodwill impairment as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, to the extent this amount does not exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The new guidance continues to allow an entity to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill impairment indicators in lieu of a quantitative assessment in certain situations. The ASU is effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact this guidance may have on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 liabilities and other claims asserted against us, including self-insured malpractice claims; \n \u2022 Separation and Distribution Agreement. This agreement governed the principal actions of both QHC and CHS that needed to be taken to effect the Spin-off. It sets forth other agreements that govern certain aspects of our relationship with CHS following the Spin-off. \n \u2022 increases in wages as a result of inflation or competition for highly technical positions and rising medical supply and drug costs due to market pressure from pharmaceutical companies and new product releases; \n\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur estimate of the net realizable amount of our patient revenues due from third-party payors is subject to complexities, including interpretations of governmental regulations and payor-specific contractual agreements that are frequently changing. The Medicare and Medicaid programs, which are the payor sources for a major portion of our patient revenues, are highly complex programs and subject to interpretation of federal and state-specific reimbursement rates, new or changing legislation and final cost report settlements.\n2017 Impairment\nSee Note 12 - Income Taxes in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the use of the separate return method of accounting for income taxes that we used during the carve-out period and for information on the projected impact of the new tax laws.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which provides for a single comprehensive principles-based model for the recognition of revenue across all industries using a five-step model to recognize revenue from customer contracts. The new standard significantly expands disclosures about the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenues and cash flows, as well as certain additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and permits the use of either a full or modified retrospective approach upon adoption. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective approach and during the fourth quarter of 2017 completed our evaluation of the resulting impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. A significant portion of the adoption of this ASU was the process of evaluating the characteristics of patient accounts receivable portfolios to ensure that when evaluated under the new standard it would result in a materially consistent revenue amount for such portfolios as if each patient account was evaluated on a contract-by-contract basis. A component of this evaluation was the estimation of what portion of an insured patient's account will ultimately be due from the patient as a co-payment or deductible and of that amount what will ultimately be collectible. We updated our processes to accommodate this estimate and recorded a change in estimate to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts at December 31, 2017, which is further discussed above in our critical accounting policies on accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts. We completed our evaluation of the impact on our results of operations as of the fourth quarter 2017 and we do not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations on a prospective basis, other than the impact of the presentation of the income statement, as the provision for bad debts will be recorded as a direct reduction to revenues and will not be presented as a separate line item.\nA summary of these agreements follows:\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nMedicare case mix index. Medicare case mix index is a relative value assigned to a diagnosis-related group of patients that is used in determining the allocation of resources necessary to treat the patients in that group. Medicare case mix index is calculated as the average case mix index for all Medicare admissions during the period.\n \u2022 competition; \nElectronic health records incentives earned decreased $14.3 million to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the decrease in activity as we move closer toward full implementation of EHR. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on EHR.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.\n \u2022 Billing and Collection Agreement ( PPSI\u201d). This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS related to collections of certain accounts receivable generated from our outpatient healthcare services, predominately physician clinics. Services include, but are not limited to, self-pay collections, insurance follow-up, collection letters and calls, payment arrangements, payment posting, dispute resolution and credit balance research. Fees are based on the type of service and are calculated based on a percentage of recoveries. \nThird-Party Reimbursements and State Supplemental Payment Programs\nOther Operating Expenses\nLegal, professional and settlement costs decreased $1.3 million to $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our costs in 2017 primarily related to investigation costs incurred by our Board related to litigation related to the Spin-off and the costs in 2016 primarily related to a QHR legal claim. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on legal matters.\nThe breadth of our operations and the complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the amount of income taxes that we will ultimately pay. The amount of income taxes ultimately paid by us is dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions, outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal and state tax audits in the normal course of business.\nRevenues\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $2.2 million net loss on the sale of two hospitals, consisting of $1.2 million related to Barrow and $1.0 million related to Sandhills. We had no comparable hospital sales in 2015. We are committed to our business strategy, which includes actively engaging in initiatives, among others, to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins. See Note 4 - Divestitures in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the sales of these hospitals, which both occurred in the month of December 2016.\nThe following table provides information related to our other operating expenses (dollars in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of positive or negative EBITDA of the Divestitures Group. We present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures because management believes this measure provides investors and other users of our financial statements with additional information about how management assesses the results of operations.\nRent\nOur net operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $66.3 million to $2,072.2 million compared to $2,138.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a 3.1% decrease. Net operating revenues decreased $108.8 million related to the Divestitures Group. Excluding the Divestitures Group, net operating revenues increased $42.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, primarily due to favorable volume and payor rate variances. Net loss attributable to Quorum Health Corporation for the years ended December 31, 2017 were $(114.2) million compared to $(347.7) million for the same period in 2016. The 2017 period included long-lived asset and goodwill impairment of $47.3 million related to hospitals held for sale or identified for divestiture, $21.0 million reduction in net operating revenues as a result of a change in estimate related to the collectability of patient accounts receivable, $0.3 million in transaction costs related to the Spin-off and a net gain of $5.2 million on the sale of hospitals. The 2016 period included $291.9 million of impairment related to our hospital operations business, consisting of $166.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets, $125.0 million of impairment to goodwill, $5.4 million of transaction costs related to the Spin-off, a net loss of $2.2 million on the sale of hospitals and a $22.8 million reduction in net operating revenues as a result of a change in estimate related to the collectability of patient accounts receivable. On a same-facility basis, our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflect a 0.5% decrease in admissions and a 0.4% increase in adjusted admissions compared to the same period in 2016. Excluding the Divestitures Group and Potential Divestitures Group, admissions and adjustment admissions increased 0.9% and 2.2% respectively, for these same periods.\nThe following table provides information on our net operating revenues (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nSeveral states utilize supplemental payment programs, including disproportionate share programs, for the purpose of providing reimbursement to providers to offset a portion of the cost of providing care to Medicaid and indigent patients. The amounts due to us under such programs are included in due from third-party payors on our balance sheets. Some of these programs have participation costs, referred to as fees or provider taxes. We record these costs in due to third-party payors on our balance sheets. After a state supplemental program is approved and fully authorized, we recognize the reimbursement payments due to us from state supplemental payment programs in the periods amounts are estimable and revenue collection is reasonably assured. These amounts are recorded in operating revenues as favorable contractual allowances and the costs we incur under these programs are recorded as other operating expenses. We record the revenues as favorable contractual allowance adjustments in our net operating revenues and the related provider taxes as other operating expenses in our statements of income.\n \u2022 unsettled circumstances that, if unfavorably resolved, would adversely affect future operations and earnings levels; \nInterest expense, net increased $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Following the Spin-off, interest expense is calculated based on the terms of our Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. The effective interest rates for our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes were approximately 8.8% and 12.9%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 and 7.7% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Our Senior Credit Facility was amended on April 11, 2017, which increased the interest rate terms on our Term Loan Facility. Additionally, for the four month period in 2016 prior to the Spin-off, we were charged interest on the amounts due to CHS at various rates ranging from 4% to 7%. Interest computations on this indebtedness were based on the outstanding balance of Due to Parent, net at the end of each month. This debt with CHS was extinguished on April 29, 2016. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below and Note 7 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness.\nWe refer to the seven hospitals that we have divested through December 31, 2017 as the Divestitures Group, the seven remaining hospitals targeted for divestiture as the Potential Divestitures Group and the remaining twenty-four hospitals that we operate as the Continuing Hospitals Group. We believe that a discussion of our operating results that distinguishes between those hospitals that management does not foresee as being part of our ongoing hospital operations business and those hospitals that will become our core hospital operations business, and available to service our debt obligations into the future, is meaningful to our stockholders, investors and other users of our financial statements. See - Overview - Recent Divestiture Activity\u201d below for additional information on our divestitures activities. These hospital groups are also further defined in - Results of Operations\u201d below.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Medicare revenues related to Medicare Advantage Plans were $186.7 million, $170.4 million and $146.9 million, respectively, or 28.4%, 25.3% and 22.4% as a percentage of total Medicare revenues, respectively.\nNet operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $48.9 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, consisting of a $40.1 million decrease in net patient revenues and an $8.8 million decrease in non-patient revenues. Our 2016 net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, included an $11.4 million negative impact to contractual allowances resulting from the change in estimate described below. In addition, our net patient revenues in 2015 were unfavorably impacted by an $11.1 million Illinois cost report settlement reversal that was initially recorded as a favorable adjustment to contractual allowances in 2014 and then reversed in 2015 due to contract negotiations finalized in the second quarter of 2015. Excluding both of these impacts, net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, decreased $17.7 million, or 0.8%, in 2016 when compared to 2015 consisting of a $21.5 million decline from the Divestitures Group and a $3.8 million increase in the Potential Divestitures Group. Net patient revenues, before the provision for bad debts, of the Continuing Hospitals Group decreased $0.1 million, consisting of an $18.3 million decrease from volumes, offset by an $18.2 million increase from payor rates. On a consolidated basis, admissions and adjusted admissions declined 3.1% and 2.3%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the Continuing Hospitals Group, admissions and adjusted admissions decreased 2.6% and 1.3%, respectively, in 2016 when compared to 2015.\nElectronic Health Records Incentives Earned\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized impairment of $13.0 million to reduce the carrying values of certain long-lived assets at seven of our hospitals to their estimated fair values. The impairment for 2015 was identified because of declining operating results and projections of future cash flows at these hospitals, which were caused by competitive and operational challenges specific to the markets in which these hospitals operate.\nElectronic Health Records Incentives Earned\nA summary of our results of operations, both in dollars and as a percentage of net operating revenues, follows (dollars in thousands):\nOn December 31, 2016, we sold 56-bed Barrow Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities ( Barrow\u201d), located in Winder, Georgia, for $6.6 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $1.4 million, $14.5 million and $6.2 million, respectively, related to Barrow. In addition to the above, we recorded a $1.2 million net loss on the sale in the year ended December 31, 2016. We also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $4.0 million related to Barrow during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYou should read the following discussion of our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, together with the audited consolidated and combined financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The financial information discussed may not necessarily reflect what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows would have been if we were a stand-alone company for the entirety of the periods presented herein or what our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be in the future.\nPrior to our separation from CHS, QHC did not operate as a separate company and stand-alone financial statements were not historically prepared; however, QHC was comprised of certain stand-alone legal entities for which discrete financial information was available under CHS' ownership. Our accompanying financial statements include amounts and disclosures for QHC that have been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of CHS for the periods prior to the Spin-off in combination with the amounts and disclosures related to the stand-alone financial statements and accounting records of QHC after the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the carve-out of financial information from CHS.\nFor the periods prior to the Spin-off, CHS used a centralized approach to cash management and to finance its operations, which included the operations of QHC. For these periods, cash and cash equivalents were swept to the CHS corporate accounts and transactions between QHC and CHS were accounted for through Due to Parent, net. This liability to CHS was settled in full on the transaction date, in part by a cash payment to CHS of $1.2 billion funded with net proceeds from the debt issuances that occurred in connection with the Spin-off. The remainder of the liability was extinguished and reclassified as a capital contribution to QHC. See Note 11 - Equity in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on the equity established in connection with the Spin-off. Following the Spin-off, we established our own depository and disbursement cash accounts with various banks and use a centralized approach to cash management.\nSalaries and Benefits\nSupplies\n \u2022 risks associated with our substantial indebtedness, leverage and debt service obligations, including our ability to comply with our debt covenants, including our senior credit facility, as amended; \nLicensed Beds. Licensed beds are the number of beds for which the appropriate state agency licenses a hospital, regardless of whether the beds are actually available for patient use.\nProvision for Bad Debts\nFor self-pay receivables, the total amount of contractual allowances, discounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces these receivables to their net carrying value was $545.8 million and $571.7 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If our self-pay receivables being pursued by outside collection agencies were included in both gross self-pay receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts above, the allowance for doubtful accounts related to self-pay receivables as a percentage of gross self-pay receivables would have been 94.5% and 92.1% at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If our actual collection percentage differed by 1% from our estimated collection percentage as a result of a change in recoveries, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed $5.1 million. If we applied a 1% differential to our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts related to self-pay receivables as of December 31, 2017, our patient accounts receivable, net would have changed by $6.1 million.\nInterest Expense, Net\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The critical accounting estimates and judgments presented below are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies that require estimates, but are limited to those that involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. We believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts in our financial statements are appropriate. If actual results differ from these assumptions and considerations, the resulting impact could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOther operating expenses decreased $22.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net operating revenues, other operating expenses were 29.9% and 30.3% in these respective years. Other operating expenses declined $11.8 million related to management fees from Parent that existed in 2016 with no comparable other operating expenses in 2017. The comparable costs are primarily included in salaries and benefits following the Spin-off. Other\nAdjusted Admissions. Adjusted admissions is computed by multiplying admissions by gross patient revenues and then dividing that number by gross inpatient revenues.\n\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment evaluation in the fourth quarter of each year. For our annual evaluation, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units utilizing two modeling approaches, a discounted cash flow model and an earnings multiple model. The discounted cash flow model applies a discount rate to our cash flow forecasts that is based on our best estimate of our weighted-average cost of capital. The earnings multiple model applies a market supported multiple to EBITDA. Both models are based on our best estimate of future revenues and operating costs and expenses as of the testing date. Additionally, the results of both models are reconciled to our consolidated market capitalization, which considers the amount a potential buyer would be required to pay, in the form of a control premium, to gain sufficient ownership to set policies, direct operations and control management decisions of our company.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $291.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill, consisting of $145.6 million to property and equipment, $18.9 million to capitalized software costs, $2.4 million to medical license assets and $125.0 million to goodwill.\nA portion of our reserves for workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims included on our balance sheets relates to incurred but not reported claims prior to the Spin-off. These claims were fully indemnified by CHS under the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement. As a result, we have a corresponding receivable from CHS related to these claims on our balance sheets. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies - Insurance Reserves in the accompanying financial statements for a table that summarizes the liabilities and receivables associated with our workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims as of December 31, 2017 and 2016.\n \u2022 changes in reimbursement methodologies and rates paid by federal or state healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or commercial payors, and the timeliness of reimbursement payments, including delays in certain states in which we operate; \nWe use a third-party automated contractual allowance system to calculate our contractual allowances each month. Contractual allowances are calculated utilizing historical paid claims data by payor source, which is uploaded into the system each month. The key assumptions used by the system to calculate the current period estimated contractual allowances are derived on a payor-specific basis from the estimated contractual reimbursement percentage and historical paid claims data. The automated contractual allowance system does not include patient account level information, as it estimates an average contractual allowance for each payor source. Due to the complexities involved in the contractual allowance estimates, actual reimbursement payments we receive from third-party payors could be different from the amounts we estimated and recorded. If the actual contractual reimbursement percentages by payor source differed by 1% from our estimated contractual reimbursement percentages, our net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 would have changed by $14.9 million. If we applied a 1% differential to our patient accounts receivable due from governmental, managed care and commercial third-party payors as of December 31, 2017, patient accounts receivable, net would have changed by $18.2 million.\nThe following table provides a summary of the impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\n\n \u2022 the ability to achieve operating and financial targets and to control the costs of providing services if patient volumes are lower than expected; \n \u2022 the risk factors included in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d \nConsolidated and Combined. Our financial statements include amounts and disclosures related to the stand-alone financial statements and accounting records of QHC after the Spin-off ( consolidated\u201d) in combination with amounts and disclosures that have been derived for the businesses comprising QHC from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of CHS for the periods prior to the completion of the Spin-off ( combined\u201d). Any references to our financial statements, financial data and operating data refer to our consolidated and combined financial statements unless otherwise noted.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\n</td> </tr>\nAgreements with CHS Related to the Spin-off\n\nWe perform an ongoing strategic review of our hospitals based on an analysis of financial performance, current competitive conditions, expected demographic trends, joint venture opportunities and capital allocation requirements. We are actively engaging in initiatives to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins, among others. In 2016, we sold two hospitals and their affiliated entities for combined proceeds of $13.8 million. In 2017, we sold five hospitals and their affiliated entities for combined proceeds of $32.1 million. We have targeted an additional seven hospitals that we intend to divest or close within twelve to twenty-four months. We continually evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture which could result in changes to the hospitals included in this group in future periods. The seven targeted potential divestiture hospitals had net operating income (losses) of $(40.7) million, $(17.7) million and $(20.7) million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nA summary of the major transition services agreements follows:\nOn June 30, 2017, we sold 231-bed Trinity Hospital of Augusta and its affiliated facilities ( Trinity\u201d), located in Augusta, Georgia, for $15.9 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $9.7 million, $9.5 million and $2.9 million, respectively, related to Trinity. In addition to the above, we recorded a $5.2 million gain\nThe following table provides information related to our supplies expense (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nThe following table provides information related to our other operating expenses (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nThe following table reconciles the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate (dollars in thousands):\n\n \u2022 the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets and liabilities. \n \u2022 Computer and Data Processing Transition Services Agreement. This agreement defines services to be provided by CHS for information technology infrastructure, support and maintenance. Services include, but are not limited to, operational support for various applications, oversight, maintenance and information technology support services, such as helpdesk, product support, network monitoring, data center operations, service ticket management and vendor relations. Fees are based on both a fixed charge for labor costs, as well as direct charges for all third-party vendor contracts entered into by CHS on QHC's behalf. \n \u2022 the impact of changes made to the Affordable Care Act, the potential for repeal or additional changes to the Affordable Care Act, its implementation or its interpretation, as well as changes in other federal, state or local laws or regulations affecting the healthcare industry; \nThe following table provides information related to our salaries and benefits expenses (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nOn February 1, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to sell 77-bed Clearview Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities ( Clearview'), located in Monroe, Georgia. We currently anticipate completing the sale of this hospital by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $1.2 million of impairment to Medicare licenses of Clearview during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\n\nIn addition to the above, we experienced a decline in operating results at several of our hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016. This led management to perform additional testing for impairment using a December 31, 2016 measurement date. As a result of this analysis, we recorded additional impairment of $38.8 million related to held for use assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. The carrying values of long-lived assets, including those classified as held for sale, are reported in our balance sheet net of impairment as of December 31, 2016.\nA summary of our operating results, both in dollars and as a percentage of net operating revenues, follows (dollars in thousands):\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law. The Tax Act includes a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impact us, most notably a reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% for tax years after December 31, 2017. As a direct result of changes in tax law due to the passage of the Tax Act, we recorded a total tax benefit of $24.0 million during 2017 which is composed of two amounts: a tax benefit of $10.9 million in deferred income tax expense for the net change in our deferred tax liabilities at the new 21% tax rate, and a $13.1 million tax benefit in deferred income tax expense for the reduction in valuation allowance attributable to the change in net realizability of deferred tax assets. The Tax Act also provides for acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017, as well as prospective changes beginning in 2018. These prospective changes include an increased limitation on the deductibility of executive compensation, a limitation on the deductibility of interest expense, new rules surrounding meals and entertainment expense and fines and penalties. Also, while net operating losses generated in the future may by carried forward indefinitely under the new law, there is a limitation on the amount that may be used in any given year. The Tax Act may also have an impact on projected future taxable income that could further affect valuation allowance considerations. In addition to the federal law, we await guidance from the states in which we file on how components of the Tax Act may be treated in these jurisdictions. Those adjustments may materially impact our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made.\nOn January 5, 2018, we announced plans to close Affinity Medical Center ( Affinity\u201d), located in Massillon, Ohio. Subsequent to January 5, 2018, our affiliates entered into an agreement with the City of Massillon related to the closure whereby all of the owned real property and a substantial majority of the related tangible assets located at the hospital will be transferred to the City of Massillon in exchange for nominal consideration and the assumption of certain ongoing real property lease obligations and equipment lease obligations. Operations ceased on February 11, 2018 and we currently anticipate that the asset transfer to the City of Massillon will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2018. We recorded $16.1 million and $20.2 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Affinity during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively.\n \u2022 our ability to attract and retain, at reasonable employment costs, qualified personnel, key management, physicians, nurses and other healthcare workers; \nIn connection with the Spin-off, we issued $400 million in aggregate principal amount of 11.625% Senior Notes due 2023 (the Senior Notes\u201d) on April 22, 2016 and entered into a credit agreement on April 29, 2016, consisting of an $880 million senior secured term loan facility (the Term Loan Facility\u201d) and a $100 million senior secured revolving credit facility (the Revolving Credit Facility\u201d), or on a combined basis referred to as the Senior Credit Facility.\u201d In addition, we entered into a $125 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility. The net offering proceeds of the Senior Notes, together with the net borrowings under the Term Loan Facility, were used to make a $1.2 billion payment from QHC to CHS and to pay our transaction and financing fees and expenses.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 the potential adverse impact of known and unknown government investigations, internal investigations, audits, and federal and state false claims act litigation and other legal proceedings, including the shareholder and creditor litigations against our company and certain of our officers and threats of litigation, as well as the significant costs and attention from management required to address such matters; \nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nWe calculate our provision for income taxes and account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income taxes are recorded to represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. The provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred income taxes during the year. Deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and the enactment of new or amended tax laws.\n</table>\n\nA summary of our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source follows (dollars in thousands):\n\noperating expenses also declined $41.7 million related to the Divestitures Group, and increased $3.8 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and $20.5 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Potential Divestitures Group and the Continuing Hospitals Group was primarily due to a $9.7 million increase in medical specialist fees resulting from contracts related to emergency room services and subsidies to various third parties, including hospitalists and a $8.2 million increase in taxes and insurance primarily related to $3.2 million of New Mexico gross receipts tax refunds received in 2016 with no comparable tax refund in 2017. We are disputing in arbitration, among other issues and actions, certain charges and lack of performance of various obligations under the transition services agreements with our former Parent.\nAmounts we collect for medical treatment of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and non-governmental third-party payors are generally less than our standard billing rates. Our standard charges and reimbursement rates for routine inpatient services vary significantly depending on the type of medical procedure performed and the geographical location of the hospital. Differences in our standard billing rates and the amounts we expect to collect from third-party payors are classified as contractual allowances. The reimbursements we ultimately receive as payments for services are determined for each patient instance of care, based on the contractual terms we negotiate with third-party payors or based on federal and state regulations related to governmental healthcare programs. Our contractual allowances are impacted by the timing and ability of CHS to monitor the classification and collection of our patient accounts receivable. Billings and collections are outsourced to CHS under the transition services agreements that were put in place by CHS in connection with the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on these agreements. Except for emergency department services, our policy is to determine the payment methodology with patients prior to when the services are performed. Self-pay and other payor discounts are incentives offered to uninsured or underinsured patients or other payors to reduce their costs of healthcare services.\n\nResults of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2017, we owned or leased a diversified portfolio of 31 hospitals in rural and mid-sized markets, which are located in 15 states and have a total of 2,979 licensed beds. Our hospitals provide a broad range of hospital and outpatient healthcare services, including general and acute care, emergency room, general and specialty surgery, critical care, internal medicine, obstetrics, diagnostic services, psychiatric and rehabilitation services. For our hospital operations business, we are paid for our services by governmental agencies, private insurers and directly by the patients we serve. We also operate QHR, a leading hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business. For our hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services business, we are paid by the non-affiliated hospitals utilizing our services. Over 95% of our net operating revenues are attributable to our hospital operations business.\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 (Unaudited)\n \u2022 cumulative earnings or losses in recent years, adjusted for certain nonrecurring items; \nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOther Government Regulations\nThe California Department of Health Care Services implemented the HQAF Program, imposing a fee on certain general and acute care California hospitals. Revenues generated from these fees provide funding for the non-federal supplemental payments to California hospitals that serve California's Medi-Cal and uninsured patients. Under Phase IV of the program, covering the period from January 2014 through December 2016, and Phase V of the program, covering the period from January 2017 through June 2019, we recognized $22.0 million, $34.4 million and $31.5 million of operating revenues, net of provider taxes, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs related to hospitals that have been divested decreased $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nRecent Divestiture Activity\nWe have summarized our results of operations, including certain financial and operating data, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and for the sequential quarters ended December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 on a comparative basis below. The definitions of certain terms used throughout the remainder of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d follows:\nRent expense increased $0.3 million to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.4% and 2.3% in these respective years.\nThe following table provides information on certain drivers of our\nInterest expense, net increased $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the new debt structure put in place in connection with the Spin-off. Interest expense for the period following the Spin-off is calculated based on the terms of the Credit Agreements and Senior Notes. The effective interest rates for our Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes were approximately 7.7% and 12.5%, respectively, at December 31, 2016. Prior to the Spin-off, we were charged interest on our indebtedness with CHS at various rates ranging from 4% to 7%. Interest computations on this indebtedness were based on the outstanding balance of Due to Parent, net at the end of each month. This debt with CHS was extinguished on April 29, 2016, the Spin-off date. See Note 7 - Long-Term Debt in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our indebtedness.\nDays revenue outstanding related to patient accounts receivable, excluding amounts recorded as due from and due to third-party payors on our balance sheets, was 63 days and 68 days as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we received $31 million of approximately $50 million of 2015 and 2016 outstanding amounts from the California HQAF program. In this same quarter, we also received a total of $51 million of the approximate $65 million in arrears from Illinois Medicaid and state employee patients. The portion of our allowance for doubtful accounts representing an adjustment for expected recoveries of self-pay receivables aged over 365 days that have been placed with outside collection agencies was 4 days as of December 31, 2017.\nThe following table provides a summary of the sources and uses of cash directly related to our separation from CHS (in thousands):\n \u2022 our ability to utilize our income tax loss carryforwards and risks associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; \nThe following table provides information related to our net operating revenues (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\nThe following table contains a summary of the major transactions to effect the Spin-off of QHC as a newly formed, independent company (dollars in thousands):\n\nOverview\n\n\nElectronic health records incentives earned decreased $6.8 million to $4.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $11.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the decrease in activity as we move closer toward full implementation of EHR. See Note 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies - Revenues in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on EHR.\nFor step two goodwill impairment testing, we engaged a professional valuation firm to perform a hypothetical purchase price valuation of each of our hospitals utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date. The results of the third-party valuation, which were completed in the fourth quarter of 2016, indicated that the carrying values of certain of our individual hospitals exceeded their fair values. Considering these results to be an indicator of potential impairment and to assess whether any additional impairment of long-lived assets existed, we utilized a September 30, 2016 measurement date to perform an analysis of undiscounted cash flows for each hospital in which an indicator of impairment was identified. Based on the results of these analyses, we recorded impairment of $82.7 million related to long-lived assets at certain hospitals and a downward adjustment to our previously recorded goodwill impairment estimate of $80 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The net impact to our financial statements was $2.7 million of additional impairment in the fourth quarter of 2016 beyond the initial estimate of $200 million estimate recorded as the preliminary step-two calculation in the second quarter of 2016.\n \u2022 our ability to successfully make acquisitions or complete divestitures and the timing thereof, our ability to complete any such acquisitions or divestitures on desired terms or at all, and our ability to realize the intended benefits from any such acquisitions or divestitures; \n\n \u2022 the extent to which states support or implement changes to Medicaid programs, utilize healthcare insurance exchanges or alter the provision of healthcare to state residents through regulation or otherwise; \nThe following table provides a summary of the impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016 subsequent to the Spin-off (in thousands):\nWe have a definitive agreement to sell another hospital in the Potential Divestitures Group, 77-bed Clearview Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities, located in Monroe, Georgia. We currently anticipate completing the sale of this hospital in the first quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 the timing and amount of cash flows related to the California HQAF Program, as well as the potential for retroactive adjustments for prior year payments; \nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $1.8 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As a percentage of net operating revenues, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was 0.1% and 0.2% in these respective years. Our noncontrolling interest partnership associated with Trinity was dissolved in connection with the sale of this hospital in the second quarter of 2017.\nOur strategic review process is ongoing and we may be unable to divest or realize proceeds from the sale or closure of any or all hospitals we consider for divestiture. We may also be subject to impairment charges in the future as a result of our ongoing strategic review process.\nefforts in collecting the Company's accounts receivables, economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental healthcare coverage, among other things, could affect our collection levels and are considered in our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts each period. We also continually review our overall allowance adequacy by monitoring historical cash collections experience, revenue trends by payor classification and days revenue outstanding, the composition of self-pay receivables between pure self-pay patients and the patient responsibility portion of third-party insured receivables, and the impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions.\nCollections are impacted by the economic ability of patients to pay and the effectiveness of CHS' billing and collection efforts, including their current policies on billings, accounts receivable payor classifications, collections, and our own efforts to further attempt collection. As previously stated, billings and collections are outsourced to CHS under the transition services agreements that were put in place with the Spin-off. See Note 18 - Related Party Transactions in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on these agreements. Significant changes in payor mix, centralized business office operations, including CHS'\nIncome Taxes\nSome of the matters discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements. Statements that are predictive in nature, that depend upon or refer to future events or conditions or that include words such as expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d thinks,\u201d and similar expressions are forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements.\nProvision for Bad Debts and the Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased $35.1 million to $82.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $117.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Depreciation and amortization decreased $9.3 million related to the Divestitures Group. In addition, depreciation and amortization is lower in 2017 when compared to 2016 due to impairment recorded in 2017 and 2016 reducing the asset bases of our long-lived assets and due to the discontinuation of depreciation and amortization related to long-lived assets classified as held for sale.\n\nLegal, professional and settlement costs of $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily related to $4.6 million of costs associated with a QHR legal matter and $1.9 million of costs primarily associated with litigation related to the Spin-off. We did not have any comparable costs in 2015. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies - Commercial Litigations and Other Lawsuits in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on our legal matters.\nOur income tax benefit was $53.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and our income tax expense was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our effective tax rates were 13.5% and 41.1% for these respective years. The decrease in our effective tax rate in 2016 when compared to 2015 was primarily due to our 2016 pre-tax loss, recording a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be recognized, which we initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016, and the additional impact in 2016 of a greater proportion of non-deductible expenses relative to our pre-tax loss. These non-deductible expenses were primarily the non-deductible portions of our goodwill impairment and Spin-off costs. See Note 12 - Income Taxes in the accompanying financial statements.\nInterest Expense, Net\nPotential Divestitures Group. The Potential Divestitures Group, as of December 31, 2017, includes seven hospitals that management has identified for potential divestiture over the next twelve to twenty-four month period. We continually evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture which could result in changes to the hospitals included in this group in future periods.\n \u2022 any potential impairments in the carrying values of long-lived assets and goodwill or the shortening of the useful lives of long-lived assets; \nAdmissions. Admissions represent the number of patients admitted for inpatient services.\nOur hospital operations and hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services operations meet the criteria to be classified as reporting units for goodwill. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the same time every year and when an event occurs or circumstances change that, more likely than not, reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. There is a two-step method for determining goodwill impairment. Step one is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with the unit's carrying amount, including goodwill. If this test indicates the fair value is less than the carrying value, then step two is required. Step two is to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill. When an indicator of potential impairment is identified in interim periods, we evaluate goodwill for impairment at such date.\n \u2022 the availability, or lack thereof, of taxable income in prior carryback periods that would limit realization of tax benefits; and \nThese factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n \u2022 the success and long-term viability of healthcare insurance exchanges and potential changes to the beneficiary enrollment process; \nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized a $5.2 million net gain on the sale of hospitals primarily related to the $5.3 million gain on the sale of Trinity in the second quarter of 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $2.2 million net loss on the sale of two hospitals, consisting of $1.2 million related to Barrow and $1.0 million related to Sandhills. We are committed to our business strategy, which includes actively engaging in initiatives, among others, to divest underperforming hospitals, reduce our debt and refine our portfolio to a more sustainable group of hospitals with higher operating margins. We have divested a total of seven hospitals in 2017 and 2016. See Note 4 - Divestitures in the accompanying financial statements for additional information on divestitures.\nThe following table provides a summary of the components of due from and due to third-party payors (in thousands):\n \u2022 the impact of cyber-attacks or security breaches; \n \u2022 Employee Matters Agreement. This agreement governs certain compensation and employee benefit obligations with respect to the employees and non-employee directors of QHC and CHS. It also allocated liabilities and responsibilities relating to employment matters, employee compensation, employee benefit plans and other related matters as of the Spin-off date. \n \u2022 Tax Matters Agreement. This agreement governs respective rights, responsibilities and obligations of QHC and CHS after the Spin-off with respect to deferred tax liabilities and benefits, tax attributes, tax contests and other tax sharing regarding U.S. federal, state and local income taxes, other tax matters and related tax returns. \nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts.\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures, to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nThe following table provides a summary of patient accounts receivable, before contractual allowances, discounts and the allowance for doubtful accounts, by payor source (dollars in thousands):\nAdjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is EBITDA adjusted to add back the effect of certain legal, professional and settlement costs, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill, net gain (loss) on sale of hospitals, transaction costs related to the Spin-off, post-spin headcount reductions and change in estimate related to collectability of patient accounts receivable. We use Adjusted EBITDA as a measure of financial performance. Adjusted EBITDA is a key measure used by our management to assess the operating performance of our hospital operations business and to make decisions on the allocation of resources. Additionally, management utilizes Adjusted EBITDA in assessing our consolidated results of operations and in comparing our results of operations between periods.\n\nSame-facility. Same-facility financial and operating data, as presented in the comparative discussions herein, excludes hospitals that were sold prior to and as of the end of the current reporting period. Our same-facility operating results for the three months and years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and the three months ended September 30, 2017, which are reported herein, have been\nrelated to medical licenses associated with our hospital operations business in the fourth quarter of 2017. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.\nWe are currently engaged in preliminary discussions with CHS related to the transition of certain of our transition services agreements related to billing and collections and eligibility screening services. We are seeking to bring these services in-house; however, we are unable to provide any assurances as to the timing of such an agreement or whether such agreement will be reached.\nSalaries and benefits increased $40.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to $29.2 million of corporate salaries and benefits in the eight month period following the Spin-off, which included $7.4 million of stock-based compensation. Prior to the Spin-off, management fees were allocated to QHC for corporate functions of CHS and were included in other operating expenses. Salaries and benefits declined $0.9 million related to the Divestitures Group, declined $2.2 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $9.6 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group primarily related to increased costs related to our self-insurance health claims and costs related to our clinic operations as a result of our physician recruiting efforts.\n \u2022 expected earnings or losses in future years; \nSupplies expense increased $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Supplies expense increased $0.7 million related to the Divestitures Group, declined $0.8 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group and increased $8.8 million related to the Continuing Hospitals Group. The increase in the Continuing Hospitals Group was primarily due to the renegotiated contract with our group purchasing organization following the Spin-off, which resulted in a reduction in rebates and administrative fee reimbursements of $5.3 million in 2016 when compared to 2015.\nHospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission. Hospital operations man-hours per adjusted admission is calculated as total paid employed and contract labor hours at both our hospitals and affiliated outpatient facilities divided by adjusted admissions. It is used by management as a measurement of productivity.\nWe estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts by reserving a percentage of all self-pay patient receivables without regard to aging category, based on collection history. The allowance percentage is based on a model that considers historical write-off activity and is adjusted for expected recoveries and any anticipated changes in trends. Our ability to estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts is not significantly impacted by the aging of accounts receivable as management believes that substantially all of the risk exists at the point in time such accounts are identified as self-pay. For our insured receivables, which are non-self-pay receivables, we estimate the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical collection rates for the uncontractualized portion of all accounts aging over 365 days from the date of patient discharge, reduced by an estimate for expected recoveries. Generally, these non-self-pay accounts receivable aged over 365 days represent an immaterial percentage of our total patient accounts receivable on our balance sheets. We believe that we collect substantially all of our third-party insured receivables, which include receivables from governmental agencies.\nThe following table reconciles the differences between the statutory federal income tax rate and our effective tax rate (dollars in thousands):\nOther Operating Expenses\nOn October 31, 2017, we sold 72-bed L.V. Stabler Memorial Hospital and its affiliated facilities ( L.V. Stabler\u201d), located in Greenville, Alabama, for proceeds of $2.8 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $4.8 million, $5.8 million and $5.0 million, respectively, related to L.V. Stabler. In addition to the above, we recorded less than $0.1 million loss on the sale for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $2.5 million and $2.9 million of related to L.V. Stabler in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recorded a total of $5.4 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of L.V. Stabler in the years ended 2016 and 2017.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded impairment of $47.3 million, $291.9 million and $13.0 million, respectively. See - Overview - 2017 Impairment and - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in these years.\nDuring the three months ended December 31, 2017, we evaluated the fair value of hospitals classified as held for sale and evaluated other hospitals intended for potential divestiture. In connection with this evaluation, we recognized long-lived asset impairment of $25.8 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, which consisted of $23.7 million of property and equipment and $2.1 million of intangible assets impairment. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we evaluated the fair value of hospitals classified as held for sale and evaluated other hospitals intended for potential divestiture. In connection with this evaluation, we recognized long-lived asset and goodwill impairment of $5.3 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017, which consisted of $3.7 million of property and equipment, $1.0 million of intangible assets and $0.6 million of goodwill impairment. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we recognized $12.9 million of impairment to property and equipment of certain hospitals in our Potential Divestitures Group for which we have received letters of intent. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, management made a decision to classify certain additional hospitals as held for sale. In connection with this decision, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of the hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $3.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill during the three months ended March 31, 2017, which consisted of $1.1 million of property and equipment, $0.8 million of intangible assets and $1.4 million of goodwill impairment.\nA summary of our results of operations, both in dollars and as a percentage of net operating revenues, follows (dollars in thousands):\n \u2022 demographic changes; \n2016 Impairment\nNet Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nThe following table provides information related to interest expense, net (in thousands):\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $0.9 million to $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $3.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net operating revenues, net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was 0.2% and 0.1% in these respective years.\n \u2022 the failure to comply with governmental regulations; \nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted contractual allowances in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.\n\n\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\nElectronic Health Record Incentive Payments\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable are related to providing healthcare services to patients at our hospitals and outpatient service facilities. Collection of these accounts receivable is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance. Our primary collection risks relate to uninsured patients and the patient financial responsibility portion of payments due from insured patients, generally deductibles and co-payments. Our policy is to verify the health insurance coverage of a patient prior to the procedure date for all medical treatment scheduled in advance. We do not verify insurance coverage in advance of treatment for walk-in and emergency room patients.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Goodwill\nAs of December 31, 2016, we recorded a change in estimate of $11.4 million to reduce the net realizable value of our patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted contractual allowances in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to increasing delays associated with collections on accounts receivable under the Illinois Medicaid program.\n\nThe following table provides information related to our net operating revenues, before the provision for bad debts, by payor source (dollars in thousands):\nThe following table provides information related to our supplies expense (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\n\n \u2022 changes in medical or other technology; \nAlthough we believe that these forward-looking statements are based upon reasonable assumptions, these assumptions are inherently subject to significant regulatory, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and may be beyond our control. Accordingly, we cannot give any assurance that our expectations will in fact occur and caution that actual results may differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. Given these uncertainties, prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this filing. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, or to make any other forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2017, we analyzed our self-pay patient accounts receivable at a more comprehensive and disaggregated level and refined our estimate of the collectability of the portion of self-pay accounts receivable related to insured patients, primarily co-pays and deductibles. Our analysis also included an evaluation of patient accounts receivable retained in the divestitures of six of our seven divested hospitals. As a result of these efforts, we recorded a change in estimate of $21.0 million to reduce the net realizable value of patient accounts receivable, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nPursuant to the terms of the Separation and Distribution Agreement, CHS made a non-cash capital contribution of $530.6 million and transferred $13.5 million of cash to us on the Spin-off date. The cash transfer consisted of an agreed upon $20.0 million for the initial funding of our working capital, reduced by $6.5 million for the difference in estimated and actual financing fees and expenses incurred at the closing of the Spin-off.\nSupplies expense decreased $8.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Supplies expense declined $14.7 million related to the Divestitures Group and $3.1 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group. Supplies expense of the Continuing Hospitals Group increased $9.9 million, primarily due to an increase in adjusted admissions of 2.2% for 2017 compared to 2016 which resulted from increased implant costs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $291.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill, consisting of $145.6 million to property and equipment, $18.9 million to capitalized software costs, $2.4 million to medical license assets and $125.0 million to goodwill. As a result of management's decision in the second quarter following the Spin-off to divest certain hospitals and evaluate additional hospitals for potential divestiture, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and additionally identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to our hospital operations reporting unit in this quarter. We concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. As a result of all of the above, we recorded impairment in the second quarter of 2016 of $41.0 million related to property and equipment, $4.4 million related to capitalized software costs and $205.0 million related to goodwill, which included a preliminary step two goodwill impairment estimate. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we revised our goodwill impairment estimate by recording a downward adjustment of $80 million, but recorded additional impairment of $71.9 million related to property and equipment and $10.8 million related to capitalized software costs in connection with finalizing our step two goodwill impairment evaluation. Additionally, due to additional indicators of impairment resulting from continued operating losses at certain of our hospitals in the second half of 2016, we recorded further impairment of $32.7 million related to property and equipment, $3.7 million related to capitalized software costs and $2.4 million\nThe following table reconciles Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures and Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures to net income (loss), the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure (in thousands):\nThe main factors that we consider include:\nWhenever an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain long-lived assets may be impaired, we project the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets. If the projections indicate that the carrying values are not expected to be recovered, the assets are reduced to their estimated fair value based on a quoted market price, if available, or an estimated value based on valuation techniques available in the circumstances.\nOn March 1, 2018, we sold 70-bed Vista Medical Center West and its affiliated facilities ( Vista West\u201d), located in Waukegan, Illinois, for proceeds of $1.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax gains (losses) of $(2.3) million, $4.9 million, and $5.7 million respectively, related to Vista West. In addition to the above, we recorded $11.1 million and $4.1 million to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Vista West during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We do not expect the loss on sale of this hospital will be material, after consideration of the impairment recorded.\nThe following table provides information on certain drivers of our net operating revenues:\n \u2022 our ongoing ability to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology and recognize income for the related Medicare or Medicaid incentive payments, to the extent such payments have not expired; \nProvision for Bad Debts\nThe following table provides information on our net operating revenues (dollars in thousands, except per adjusted admission amounts):\n \u2022 our ability to maintain certain accreditations at our existing facilities and any future facilities we may acquire; \nDays revenue outstanding. Days revenue outstanding approximates the average collection period for patient accounts receivable. It is calculated by dividing net patient accounts receivable at the end of the period by average net operating revenues per day for the most recent three months. Net patient accounts receivable excludes the amounts reported as due from and to third-party payors related to final cost report settlements and state supplemental payment programs.\nOn December 1, 2016, we sold 64-bed Sandhills Regional Medical Center and its affiliated facilities ( Sandhills\u201d), located in Hamlet, North Carolina, for $7.2 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included a pre-tax losses of $0.2 million, $6.9 million and $2.0 million, respectively, related to Sandhills. In addition to the above, we recorded a $1.0 million net loss on the sale in the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $4.8 million related to Sandhills during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nThe provision for bad debts increased $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the $11.4 million change in estimate recorded as of December 31, 2016, which negatively impacted the provision for bad debts in our statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. This change in estimate related to our assessment of the collectability of our managed care and commercial accounts receivable aged greater than one year based on a review of historical cash collections for these accounts. The provision for bad debts decreased $0.1 million related to the Divestitures Group. The remaining increase was due to a decline in the collectability of self-pay accounts receivable indicated by the most recent hindsight model.\n\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $47.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill. In the first quarter of 2017, we classified certain additional hospitals as held for sale. As part of this process, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of all our hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of our hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2016 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis. In the first quarter of 2017, we recorded impairment totaling $3.3 million, consisting of $1.1 million related to property and equipment, $0.8 million related to capitalized software costs and $1.4 million related to goodwill. In the second quarter of 2017, we recognized $12.9 million of impairment to long-lived assets of certain hospitals which we have identified as potential divestiture candidates and for which we have received letters of intent. In the third quarter of 2017, we recognized $5.3 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill of certain hospitals which we have identified as potential divestiture candidates and for which we have received letters of intent, consisting of $3.7 million related to property and equipment and $0.6 million related to goodwill. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized $25.8 million of impairment to long-lived assets and goodwill of potential divestiture candidates, consisting of $23.7 million related to property and equipment and $2.1 million related to capitalized software costs. See - Overview - 2017 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2017.\nCharity Care\nThe following table shows the portion of our Medicaid reimbursements attributable to state supplemental payment programs (in thousands):\nSalaries and Benefits\nLegal, Professional and Settlement Costs\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2016 and subsequent to the Spin-off, management made a decision to classify certain hospitals as held for sale and evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture. As a result, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and recorded $45.4 million of long-lived asset impairment in this quarter. In addition, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals we classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of our hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2015 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $5.0 million of goodwill impairment in this quarter. In this same quarter, we identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to our hospital operations reporting unit and concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. The primary indicators were our declining market capitalization, as compared to the carrying value of equity, and a decrease in estimated future earnings of our hospital operations reporting unit. We performed a calculation of the overall fair value of this reporting unit in step one of the impairment test and concluded that the carrying value of the hospital operations reporting unit as of June 30, 2016 exceeded its estimated fair value. We performed a preliminary step two calculation of goodwill impairment to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of the hospital operations reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimated and recorded additional goodwill impairment of $200 million in the second quarter of 2016.\n \u2022 our ability to obtain adequate levels of professional and general liability and workers' compensation liability insurance; and \n \u2022 the availability and terms of capital to fund acquisitions, replacement facilities or other capital expenditures; \nDuring the second quarter following the Spin-off, we made the decision to classify certain hospitals as held for sale and evaluate other hospitals for potential divestiture. Due to the increase in net operating losses associated with these hospitals, we analyzed the long-lived assets of all of our hospitals to test for impairment and recorded $45.4 million of long-lived asset impairment in this quarter. In addition, we evaluated the estimated relative fair value of the hospitals classified as held for sale in relation to the overall fair value of the hospital operations reporting unit utilizing a September 30, 2015 measurement date, which was the measurement date of our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis, and recognized $5.0 million of goodwill impairment in this quarter. In this same quarter, we identified certain indicators of goodwill impairment related to the hospital operations reporting unit and concluded that such indicators necessitated an interim goodwill impairment evaluation. The primary indicators were declining market capitalization, as compared to the carrying value of equity, and a decrease in estimated future earnings of the hospital operations reporting unit. We performed a calculation of the overall fair value of this reporting unit in step one of the impairment test and concluded that the carrying value of our hospital operations reporting unit as of June 30, 2016 exceeded the estimated fair value. We performed a preliminary step two calculation of goodwill impairment to determine the implied fair value of goodwill of the hospital operations reporting unit in a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Based on this preliminary analysis, we estimated and recorded additional goodwill impairment of $200 million in the second quarter of 2016.\n\n \u2022 general economic and business conditions, both nationally and in the regions in which we operate; \nThe Affordable Care Act, as currently structured, mandates that substantially all U.S. citizens maintain health insurance coverage, while expanding access to coverage through a combination of private sector health insurance reforms and public program expansion. However, there is considerable uncertainty with regard to the future of the Affordable Care Act, as the presidential administration and certain members of Congress have expressed their intent to repeal or make significant changes to the law, its implementation and its interpretation. For example, in 2017, Congress eliminated the financial penalties associated with the individual mandate, effective January 1, 2019, which may result in fewer individuals electing to purchase health insurance. In addition, several private health insurers have withdrawn from or limited their participation in the healthcare insurance exchanges, and the presidential administration has taken steps, including ending cost-sharing subsidies that were previously available to insurers, which may threaten the long-term viability of those marketplaces. Healthcare reform initiatives, including efforts to change, alter the implementation of, or repeal the Affordable Care Act, may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial position, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.\nRevenues\nContinuing Hospitals Group. The Continuing Hospitals Group consists of twenty-four hospitals which we currently intend to continue to operate as part of our core business.\nAdjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures. Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures, also a non-GAAP financial measure, is Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Divestitures, and further retrospectively adjusted to exclude the effect of positive or negative EBITDA of the Potential Divestitures Group. We present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted for Potential Divestitures because management believes this measure provides investors and other users of our financial statements with additional information about how management assesses the results of operations.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation, which was issued to simplify some of the accounting guidance for share-based compensation. Among the areas impacted by the amendments in this ASU are the accounting for income taxes related to share-based payments, accounting for forfeitures, classification of awards as equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2017. The adoption of this ASU had no material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nOn March 1, 2018, we sold 70-bed Vista Medical Center West and its affiliated facilities, located in Waukegan, Illinois, for proceeds of $1.2 million.\nadjusted to exclude the operating results of Sandhills, Barrow, Cherokee, Trinity, Lock Haven, Sunbury and L.V. Stabler, which we sold on December 1, 2016, December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, June 30, 2017, September 30, 2017, September 30, 2017 and October 31, 2017, respectively.\nRent expense increased $1.2 million to $49.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $48.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. As a percentage of net operating revenues, rent expense was 2.3% and 2.2% in these respective years.\nIn the ordinary course of business, there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. We assess our income tax positions and record deferred income tax benefits for all tax years subject to examination based upon management's evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date about the ability to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets or tax positions. For those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a future tax benefit will be sustained, our policy is to record the largest amount of income tax benefit with a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that an income tax benefit will not be sustained in the future, we do not recognize a deferred tax benefit in our financial statements. We record interest and penalties, net of any applicable tax benefit, related to income taxes, if any, as a component of the provision for income taxes when applicable.\nIn addition to the above, we experienced a decline in operating results at several hospitals in the fourth quarter of 2016. This led management to perform additional testing for impairment using a December 31, 2016 measurement date. As a result of this analysis, we recorded additional impairment of $38.8 million related to long-lived assets in the fourth quarter of 2016. See - Overview - 2016 Impairment\u201d for a table and additional information on the impairment recorded in 2016.\nWe generate revenues by providing healthcare services at our hospitals and affiliated outpatient service facilities to patients seeking medical treatment. Hospital revenues depend on, among other factors, inpatient occupancy and acuity levels, the volume of outpatient procedures and the charges and negotiated reimbursement rates for the healthcare services provided. Our primary sources of payment for patient healthcare services are third-party payors, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, Medicare and Medicaid managed care programs, commercial insurance companies, other managed care programs, workers' compensation carriers and employers. Self-pay revenues are the portion of our revenues generated from providing healthcare services to patients who do not have health insurance coverage as well as the patient responsibility portion of charges that are not covered for an individual by a health insurance program or plan. We generate revenues related to our QHR business when hospital management advisory and healthcare consulting services are provided. We report these revenues at their net realizable value. We generate other non-patient revenues primarily from rental income and hospital cafeteria sales.\n \u2022 changes in U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, including the impacts of adopting newly issued accounting standards; \n2017 Financial Overview\nOn September 30, 2017, we sold 70-bed Sunbury Community Hospital and its affiliated facilities ( Sunbury\u201d), located in Sunbury, Pennsylvania, and 47-bed Lock Haven Hospital and its affiliated facilities ( Lock Haven\u201d) located in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, for combined proceeds of $9.1 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our operating results included pre-tax losses of $8.4 million, $12.9 million and $18.7 million, respectively, related to Sunbury and Lock Haven on a combined basis. In addition to the above, we recorded a $0.1 million loss on the sale for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also recorded impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of $1.9 million, $12.7 million and $3.0 million related to Sunbury and Lock Haven during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recorded a total of $26.6 million of impairment to property, equipment and capitalized software costs of Sunbury and Lock Haven from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2017.\nAs part of the business of owning and operating hospitals, we are subject to legal actions alleging liability on our part. To mitigate a portion of this risk, we maintain insurance exceeding a self-insured retention level for these types of claims. Our self-insurance reserves reflect the current estimate of all outstanding losses, including incurred but not reported losses, based on actuarial calculations as of period end. The loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future due to updated facts and circumstances. Insurance expense in the statements of income includes the actuarially determined estimates for losses in the current year, including claims incurred but not reported, the changes in estimates for losses in prior years based on actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections, the insurance premiums for losses related to policies obtained to cover amounts in excess of our self-insured retention levels, the administrative costs of the insurance programs, and interest expense related to the discounted portions of these liabilities. Our reserves for workers' compensation and professional and general liability claims are based on semi-annual actuarial calculations, which are discounted to present value and consider historical claims data, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The liabilities for self-insured claims are discounted based on our risk-free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the self-insured claims are incurred and projected to be paid.\nSalaries and benefits decreased $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Salaries and benefits declined $60.4 million related to the Divestitures Group and $1.7 million related to the Potential Divestitures Group. These declines were offset by an increase of $35.8 million in salaries and benefits of the Continuing Hospitals Group primarily resulting from increased salaries at our clinics due to physician recruitment efforts and an increase in corporate salaries of $13.1 million as we had a full year of corporate salaries in 2017 compared to eight months in 2016. For the four months in 2016 prior to the Spin-off, management fees were allocated to QHC for corporate functions of CHS and were included in other operating expenses. The increase in corporate salaries and benefits as a result of the Spin-off was partially offset by a reduction in corporate and QHR salaries and benefits in 2017 due to headcount reductions in November 2016 and May 2017. Included in salaries and benefits expenses related to corporate functions were $10.0 million and $7.4 million of stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nHealthcare Reform\n\nThe provision for bad debts decreased $25.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a $28.7 million decrease related to the Divestitures Group.\n\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, which amends the accounting for leases and requires the rights and obligations arising from lease contracts, including existing and new arrangements, to be recognized as assets and labilities on the balance sheet. Recognition of these assets and liabilities will have a material impact to our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Under ASU 2016-02, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach, which includes a number of optional practical expedients. We expect to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019. We are still evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our policies, procedures, financial disclosures and control framework. We are additionally evaluating any modifications to our leasing strategy in response to the requirements of this standard.\nSupplies\nThe Spin-off\nCost report settlements under reimbursement programs with Medicare, Medicaid and other managed care plans are estimated and recorded in the period patient services are performed and any revisions to estimates of previous program reimbursements are recorded in subsequent periods until the final cost report settlements are determined. We account for cost report settlements in contractual allowances in our statements of income and record these amounts as due from and due to third-party payors on our balance sheets. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, contractual allowance adjustments related to previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements favorably (unfavorably) impacted our net operating revenues by $2.0 million, $(5.8) million and $(15.1) million, respectively. The 2015 amount included the unfavorable impact of an $11.1 million Illinois cost report settlement in 2014 that was reversed in the second quarter of 2015 due to contract negotiations that were finalized in that quarter. Exclusive of this adjustment, our net operating revenues were favorably (unfavorably) impacted by $(4.0) million in 2015 for all other contractual allowance adjustments related to previous program reimbursements and final cost report settlements.\nOur hospital operations business is highly regulated. We are required to comply with extensive, complicated and overlapping governmental laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations govern every aspect of how our hospitals conduct their operations, including the service lines that must be offered for licensure as an acute care hospital, restrictions related to employing physicians, and requirements applicable to eligibility and payment structures under the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in severe penalties including criminal penalties, civil sanctions, and the loss of our ability to qualify for participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nIn addition to the agreements referenced above, we entered into certain transition services agreements and other ancillary agreements with CHS defining agreed upon services, as specified by each agreement, to be provided by CHS to us commencing on the Spin-off date. The agreements generally have terms of five years.\nNet operating
