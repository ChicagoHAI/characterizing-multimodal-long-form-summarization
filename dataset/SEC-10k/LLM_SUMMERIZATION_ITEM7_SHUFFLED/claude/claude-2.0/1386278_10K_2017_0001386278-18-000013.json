We employ a unique products and platform\u201d operating model whereby we use our banking and technology assets to design, build and distribute our branded financial services products directly to consumers through a large-scale omni-channel national distribution platform; while also allowing qualified third party partners to access those same banking and technology assets to design, build and distribute their own bespoke financial services directly to their consumers through their own distribution platforms. Through our six revenue divisions and our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, we are a leading provider of prepaid cards, debit cards, checking accounts, secured credit cards, payroll debit cards, consumer cash processing services, wage disbursements and tax refund processing services. With approximately 100,000 major name U.S. retail stores selling our products, several leading direct-to-consumer websites, thousands of tax preparation offices, several apps available in the two leading app stores and distribution through several enterprise-scale Banking as a Service,\u201dor \"BaaS,\" partnerships, we are one of the most broadly distributed banking franchises in the United States. We are headquartered in Pasadena, California, with additional facilities throughout the United States and in Shanghai, China.\nAs the regulated entity and issuing bank for substantially all products and services we provide, whether our own or on behalf of a BaaS platform partner, we are directly accountable for all aspects of each program's integrity, inclusive of ensuring the program's compliance with all applicable banking regulations, applicable state and federal law and our various internal governance policies and procedures related to all areas of risk and compliance, in addition to deploying enterprise-class risk management practices and procedures to ensure each program's initial and ongoing safety and soundness.\n2017 Six Step Plan\nIn February 2017, we announced our 2017 Six Step Plan (the \"2017 Plan\") outlining our strategy to grow revenue, reduce expenses and appropriately allocate capital, all with the objective of driving EPS growth. The following describes each of the six steps within the 2017 Plan.\nStep 1: Deploy new acquisition and retention strategies to reduce the year-over-year sequential quarterly loss in active cards and return to active card growth in 2018.\nStep 2: Secure additional shelf space for the new MoneyPak and launch at least one unique and compelling new MoneyPak use case to expand the total available market.\nStep 3: Make investments in growing the successful new initiatives launched in 2016, while making modest investments in a new crop of high-potential initiatives that can drive future growth.\nStep 4: Drive incremental platform savings across the enterprise and achieve savings from integrating the UniRush acquisition over the course of 2017.\nStep 5: Continue to look for new acquisitions that are strategic, synergistic and accretive.\nStep 6: Return capital to shareholders through share buy-backs.\nWe successfully completed and exceeded our expectations for each of the six steps by the end of 2017.\nFinancial Results and Trends\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>890,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>791,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>655,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>85,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal operating revenues\nTotal operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 23.8% over the prior year. This is a result of double digit organic revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2017 and our acquisition of UniRush, which closed on February 28, 2017. In our Account Services segment, organic revenue growth was driven in part by the continued trend of an improving mix in our active card portfolio toward higher revenue generating customers as compared to the prior year, improved unit economics on our new suite of prepaid card products, a higher proportion of cards that are loaded by direct deposit, and a return to year-over-year growth in the number of active cards in our organic portfolio during the second half of 2017. These factors contributed to an improvement in the quality of our active card portfolio, as evidenced by greater customer engagement through increased gross dollar volume and purchase volume on a year-over-year basis. In our Processing and Settlement Services segment, organic revenues also increased due to a) increased transactions and higher revenue per transaction in our Tax Processing revenue division, b) increased transactions and higher revenue per transaction in our Money Processing revenue division and c) substantially increased transaction volume from our Simply Paid product line.\nTotal operating expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 20.8% over the prior year. This is principally a result of the acquisition of UniRush and higher sales and marketing expenses attributable to the year-over-year increase in organic operating revenues generated from products that are subject to revenue share payments to our distributors. Additionally, processing expenses increased as a result of higher transactional usage per active card within our organic portfolio, as processing fees are generally charged on a per transaction basis.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $9.4 million of processing expenses related to the processor conversion challenges encountered in 2016 that resulted in incremental processing charges in excess of our normalized rate. We resolved this matter during the first half of 2017 and did not incur material incremental processing expenses in excess of our normalized rate after June 30, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received approximately $6.5 million as a partial recovery of these costs, which has been recorded as an offset to processing expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $7.5 million reduction to our contingent consideration liability associated with an earn-out provision contained in the definitive merger agreement for the acquisition of our tax refund processing business. We recorded the change in fair value as a component of other general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. The third and final performance period under the earn-out provision ended on June 30, 2017. The reduction represents our firm belief that our tax refund processing business did not achieve its earn-out performance target for the fiscal period ending June 30, 2017, and therefore the total potential payout of $26 million has not been accrued on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The parties to the acquisition are attempting to resolve the final earn-out calculation according to the process provided for in the definitive merger agreement, and will likely require a neutral third party to make a final determination. To the extent there is an unfavorable resolution for the earn-out payment, we may be required to make a final earn-out payment of up to $26 million.\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $2.4 million from the prior year as a result of a lower effective tax rate. The decline in our rate was primarily due to excess tax benefits as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09 and one-time favorable adjustments to our deferred taxes assets and liabilities, including $6.3 million due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\").\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, eliminates certain deductions and enhances and extends through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. Although we have not completed our analysis of the tax effects of the Tax Act, we expect our annual effective tax rate will be lower in 2018 as a result of the Tax Act. Our annual effective rate for 2018 is difficult to predict due to a number of factors, including excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, which will vary from quarter to quarter depending on fluctuations in our stock price in each period.\nRefer to Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information about our adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the impact of the Tax Act.\nKey Metrics\nWe review a number of metrics to help us monitor the performance of, and identify trends affecting, our business. We believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual revenues.\nNumber of Active Cards - represents the total number of GPR cards and checking accounts in our portfolio that had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period. We had 5.26 million, 4.13 million, and 4.50 million active cards outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the overall size and scale of our GPR card portfolio and an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services. The increase in the number of active cards of 27% was driven by our acquisition of UniRush, as well as a 4% year-over-year increase in the number of active cards in our organic portfolio. The fourth quarter of 2017 marks the second consecutive quarter in which we have achieved year-over-year growth in organic active cards since the discontinuation of the original MoneyPak PIN product in the first quarter of 2015.\nGross Dollar Volume - represents the total dollar volume of funds processed and settled by our consolidated enterprise, excluding tax refunds processed. Our gross dollar volume was $31.8 billion, $23.0 billion, and $22.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our processing infrastructure and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services. The increase in gross dollar volume of 39% during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable prior year period was principally driven by our acquisition of UniRush and higher average gross dollar volume per organic actives during the periods.\nPurchase Volume - represents the total dollar volume of purchase transactions made by customers using our GPR, checking account and gift card products. This metric excludes the dollar volume of ATM withdrawals. Our purchase volume was $21.6 billion, $16.3 billion, and $16.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We use this metric to analyze interchange revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. The increase in purchase volume of 32% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable prior year period was driven by an increase in gross dollar volume, as described above, our acquisition of UniRush and higher purchase volume per number of active cards as a result of the increasing quality of customers within our active card base.\nNumber of Cash Transfers - represents the total number of reload transactions that we conducted through our retail distributors in a specified period. We processed 38.60 million, 37.79 million, and 38.88 million reload transactions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our retail cash reload network, as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services, and to analyze cash transfer revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. Our cash transfers increased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year primarily due to year-over-year growth in our updated MoneyPak PIN product we began selling in Q2 2016 and our swipe reload service which was driven by the increase in active cards, partially offset by an increase in direct deposit penetration in our active card portfolio as direct deposit customers, on average, perform fewer cash reloads.\nNumber of Tax Refunds Processed - represents the total number of tax refunds processed in a specified period. We processed 11.17 million, 10.52 million and 10.68 million tax refund transactions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our tax refund processing platform and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services.\nKey components of our results of operations\nOperating Revenues\nWe classify our operating revenues into the following three categories:\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues consist of monthly maintenance fees, ATM fees, new card fees and other revenues. We charge maintenance fees on GPR cards, checking accounts and certain cash transfer products, such as MoneyPak, pursuant to the terms and conditions in our customer agreements. We charge ATM fees to cardholders when they withdraw money at certain ATMs in accordance with the terms and conditions in our cardholder agreements. We charge new card fees, if applicable, when a consumer purchases a GPR card, gift card, or a checking account product. Other revenues consist primarily of revenue associated with our gift card program, annual fees associated with our secured credit card portfolio, transaction-based fees and fees associated with optional products or services, which we offer to cardholders from time to time.\nOur aggregate monthly maintenance fee revenues vary primarily based upon the number of active cards in our portfolio and the average fee assessed per account. Our average monthly maintenance fee per active card depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and upon the extent to which fees are waived based on various incentives provided to customers in an effort to encourage higher usage and retention. Our aggregate ATM fee revenues vary based upon the number of cardholder ATM transactions and the average fee per ATM transaction. The average fee per ATM transaction depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and the extent to which cardholders use ATMs within our free network that carry no fee for cash withdrawal transactions. Our aggregate new card fee revenues vary based upon the number of GPR cards and checking accounts activated and the average new card fee. The average new card fee depends primarily upon the mix of products that we sell since there are variations in new account fees based on the product and/or the location or source where our products are purchased. Our aggregate other fees vary primarily based upon account sales of all types, gift card sales, purchase transactions and the number of active accounts in our portfolio.\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues consist of cash transfer revenues, tax refund processing service revenues and Simply Paid disbursement revenues. We earn cash transfer revenues when consumers fund their cards through a reload transaction at a Green Dot Network retail location. Our aggregate cash transfer revenues vary based upon the mix of locations where reload transactions occur, since reload fees vary by location. We earn tax refund processing service revenues when a customer of a third party tax preparation company chooses to pay their tax preparation fee through the use of our tax refund processing services. We earn Simply Paid disbursement fees from our business partners as payment disbursements are made.\nInterchange Revenues - We earn interchange revenues from fees remitted by the merchant's bank, which are based on rates established by the payment networks, when customers make purchase transactions using our products. Our aggregate interchange revenues vary based primarily on the number of active cards in our portfolio, the average transactional volume of the active cards in our portfolio and on the mix of cardholder purchases between those using signature identification technologies and those using personal identification numbers and the corresponding rates.\nOperating Expenses\nWe classify our operating expenses into the following four categories:\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the commissions we pay to our retail distributors, brokers and platform partners, advertising and marketing expenses, and the costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages, placards and promotional materials to our retail distributors and personalized GPR and GoBank cards to consumers who have activated their cards. We generally establish commission percentages in long-term distribution agreements with our retail distributors and platform partners. Aggregate commissions with our retail distributors are determined by the number of prepaid cards, checking account products and cash transfers sold at their respective retail stores. Commissions with our platform partners and, in certain cases, our retail distributors are determined by the revenue generated from the ongoing use of the associated card programs. We incur advertising and marketing expenses for television, sponsorships, online and in-store promotions. Advertising and marketing expenses are recognized as incurred and typically deliver a benefit over an extended period of time. For this reason, these expenses do not always track changes in our operating revenues. Our manufacturing and distribution costs vary primarily based on the number of GPR and GoBank accounts activated by consumers.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses - Compensation and benefits expenses represent the compensation and benefits that we provide to our employees and the payments we make to third-party contractors. While we have an in-house customer service function, we employ third-party contractors to conduct call center operations, handle routine customer service inquiries and provide consulting support in the area of IT operations and elsewhere. Compensation and benefits expenses associated with our customer service and loss management functions generally vary in line with the size of our active card portfolio, while the expenses associated with other functions do not.\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses consist primarily of the fees charged to us by the payment networks, which process transactions for us, the third-party card processors that maintains the records of our customers' accounts and processes transaction authorizations and postings for us and the third-party banks that issue our accounts. These costs generally vary based on the total number of active accounts in our portfolio and gross dollar volume transacted by those accounts. Also included in processing expenses are bank fees associated with our tax refund processing services and gateway and network fees associated with our Simply Paid disbursement services. Bank fees generally vary based on the total number of tax refund transfers processed and gateway and network fees vary based on the numbers of disbursements made.\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional service fees, telephone and communication costs, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in contingent consideration, transaction losses (losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud), rent and utilities, and insurance. We incur telephone and communication costs primarily from customers contacting us through our toll-free telephone numbers. These costs vary with the total number of active cards in our portfolio, as do losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud. Costs associated with professional services, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment, amortization of our acquired intangible assets, rent and utilities vary based upon our investment in infrastructure, business development, risk management and internal controls and are generally not correlated with our operating revenues or other transaction metrics.\nIncome Tax Expense\nOur income tax expense consists of the federal and state corporate income taxes accrued on income resulting from the sale of our products and services.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, current circumstances and various other assumptions that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product is sold or the service is performed, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\nWe defer and recognize new card fee revenues on a straight-line basis over the period commensurate with our service obligation to our customers. We consider the service obligation period to be the average card lifetime. We determine the average card lifetime for each pool of homogeneous products (e.g., products that exhibit the same characteristics such as nature of service and terms and conditions) based on company-specific historical data. Currently, we determine the average card lifetime separately for our GPR cards and gift cards. For our GPR cards, we measure the card lifetime as the period of time, inclusive of reload activity, between sale (or activation) of a card and the date of the last positive balance on that card. We analyze GPR cards activated between six and thirty months prior to each balance sheet date. We use this historical look-back period as a basis for determining our average card lifetime because it provides sufficient time for meaningful behavioral trends to develop. Currently, our GPR cards have an average card lifetime of five months. The usage of gift cards is limited to the initial funds loaded to the card. Therefore, we measure these gift cards' lifetime as the redemption period over which cardholders initiate the substantial majority of their\ntransactions. Currently, gift cards have an average lifetime of six months. We reassess average card lifetime quarterly. Average card lifetimes may vary in the future as cardholder behavior changes relative to historical experience because customers are influenced by changes in the pricing of our services, the availability of substitute products, and other factors.\nWe also defer and expense commissions paid to retail distributors related to new card sales ratably over the average card lifetime, which is currently five months for our GPR cards and six months for gift cards.\nWe report our different types of revenues on a gross or net basis based on our assessment of whether we act as a principal or an agent in the transaction. To the extent we act as a principal in the transaction, we report revenues on a gross basis. In concluding whether or not we act as a principal or an agent, we evaluate whether we have the substantial risks and rewards under the terms of the revenue-generating arrangements, whether we are the party responsible for fulfillment of the services purchased by the cardholders, and other factors. For most of our significant revenue-generating arrangements, including GPR and gift cards, we recognize revenues on a gross basis. As it relates to our tax refund processing services, we act as an agent in these transactions and record revenues on a net basis.\nGenerally, customers have limited rights to a refund of the new card fee or a cash transfer fee. We have elected to recognize revenues prior to the expiration of the refund period, but reduce revenues by the amount of expected refunds, which we estimate based on actual historical refunds.\nOn occasion, we enter into incentive agreements with our retail distributors with the goal of increasing unit sales of our products to consumers. Additionally, we offer various cash-back programs to consumers on select debit and prepaid card programs with the goal of encouraging longer retention and high utilization of those products. We record these incentives, including the issuance of equity instruments, as a reduction of revenues and recognize them over the period the related revenues are recognized or as services are rendered, as applicable.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe record employee stock-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value. For stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, we base compensation expense on fair values estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For stock awards, including restricted stock units, we base compensation expense on the fair value of our Class A common stock at the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for awards with only service conditions that have graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. Vesting is based upon continued service to our company.\nFor performance based awards, we recognize compensation cost for the restricted stock units if and when we conclude it is probable that the performance will be satisfied, over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of the stock. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compensation expense based on the probability assessment. For market based restricted stock units, we base compensation expense on the fair value estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation or similar lattice model. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period regardless of the market condition being satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided, since the estimated grant date fair value already incorporates the probability of outcomes that the market condition will be achieved.\nWe measure the fair value of equity instruments issued to non-employees as of the earlier of the date a performance commitment has been reached by the counterparty or the date performance is completed by the counterparty. We determine the fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or the fair value of our Class A common stock, as applicable, and recognize related expense in the same periods that the goods or services are received.\nReserve for Uncollectible Overdrawn Accounts\nOur cardholder accounts may become overdrawn as a result of maintenance fee assessments or from purchase transactions that we honor, in each case in excess of the funds in the cardholder's account. While we decline authorization attempts for amounts that exceed the available balance in a cardholder's account, the application of card association rules, the timing of the settlement of transactions and the assessment of the card's monthly maintenance fee, among other things, can result in overdrawn accounts. Overdrawn account balances are deemed to be our receivables due from cardholders, and we include them as a component of accounts receivable, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally recover overdrawn account balances from those cardholders that perform a reload transaction. In addition, we recover some overdrawn account balances related to purchase transaction through enforcement of payment network rules, which allow us to recover the amounts from the merchant where the purchase transaction was conducted. However, we are exposed to losses from any unrecovered overdrawn account balances. The probability of recovering these amounts is primarily related to the number of days that have elapsed since an account had activity, such as a purchase, ATM transaction or fee assessment. Generally, we recover 50-60% of\noverdrawn account balances in accounts that have had activity in the last 30 days, less than 15% in accounts that have had activity in the last 30 to 60 days, and less than 10% when more than 60 days have elapsed.\nWe establish a reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts. We classify overdrawn accounts into age groups based on the number of days since the account last had activity. We then calculate a reserve factor for each age group based on the average recovery rate for the most recent six months. These factors are applied to these age groups to estimate our overall reserve. We rely on these historical rates because they have remained relatively consistent for several years. When more than 90 days have passed without any activity in an account, we consider recovery to be remote and charge off the full amount of the overdrawn account balance against the reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts. Our actual recovery rates and related estimates thereof may change in the future in response to factors such as customer behavior, product pricing and features that impact the frequency and velocity of reloads and other deposits to such accounts.\nWe include our provision for uncollectible overdrawn accounts related to maintenance fees and purchase transactions as an offset to card revenues and other fees and in other general and administrative expenses, respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe review the recoverability of goodwill at least annually or whenever significant events or changes occur, which might impair the recovery of recorded costs. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, declines in the market conditions of our products, reductions in our future cash flow estimates, and significant adverse industry or economic market trends, amongst others. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, as necessary. In the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable, we would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections, which could include, but would not be limited to, future revenues, earnings and the probability of certain outcomes.\nIntangible and other long lived-assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of the underlying assets; and significant adverse industry or market economic trends. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable, we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections, which could include, but would not be limited to, future revenues, earnings and the probability of certain outcomes. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2017. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for each of our reporting units as their fair values exceeded their carrying values indicating there was no impairment. No impairment charges were recognized related to goodwill or intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, processing and settlement service revenues and interchange revenues:\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Card revenues and other fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>414,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing and settlement service revenues\n</td> <td>217,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange revenues\n</td> <td>257,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>890,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>718,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues and other fees totaled $414.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $77.0 million, or 23%, from the comparable prior year period. We believe this increase in revenue reflects the increasing quality of customers within our active card base and improved unit economics on our suite of prepaid card products, which increased monthly maintenance fees and ATM fees earned within our Account Services segment, as well as our acquisition of UniRush on February 28, 2017.\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues totaled $217.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $33.2 million, or 18%, from the comparable prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by a higher volume and revenues earned per cash transfer and tax refund processed, as well as a year-over-year increase in disbursement revenues associated with our Simply Paid Uber program.\nInterchange Revenues - Interchange revenues totaled $257.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $61.3 million or 31%, from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to year-over-year growth in purchase volume, driven by our acquisition of UniRush and higher purchase volume per number of active cards as a result of the increasing quality of customers within our active card base.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>280,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>194,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>159,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing expenses\n</td> <td>161,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>155,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>139,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>791,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>89.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>655,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses totaled $280.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $31.5 million, or 13% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was the result of an increase of $26.1 million in sales commissions principally associated with higher organic revenues year-over-year generated from products that are subject to revenue-sharing agreements and an increase of $13.2 million in marketing expenses primarily driven by the acquisition of UniRush, partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in cost of materials. The decline in costs of materials relates to our 2016 roll out of our new suite of Green Dot branded prepaid and gift card products at our retailer distributors resulting in incremental costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages; there were no such roll out expenses in 2017.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses - Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $35.2 million or 22%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of higher salaries and wages and third-party contractor expenses of $16.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, driven by our acquisition of UniRush, and a $12.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses totaled $161.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $53.4 million, or 50%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was principally the result of our acquisition of UniRush, a higher volume of purchase and ATM transactions initiated by our cardholders and a higher volume of disbursement services, partially offset by a $6.5 million repayment of incremental processing expenses incurred during the first half of 2017 associated with our need to continue to support customer accounts on our legacy third-party card processor as discussed above.\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses totaled $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $16.2 million, or 12%, from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases of $8.3 million of professional fees, $8.1 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets driven by the acquisition of UniRush, $5.8 million in transaction losses correlated with the increase in purchase volume, a $3.5 million expense in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit, $2.3 million of telecommunication expenses and $1.2 million of impairment charges related to internal-use software. These increases were partially offset by a year-over-year increase of $7.2 million in gains associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration, principally related to acquisition of our tax refund processing business, and a decrease of $6.0 million in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our effective tax rate among federal, state and other:\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. federal statutory tax rate\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General business credits\n</td> <td>(2.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>(12.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax Cuts and Jobs Act remeasurement\n</td> <td>(5.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur income tax expense decreased by $2.4 million to $17.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the prior year due to a decrease in our effective tax rate from 32.4% to 17.0%. This decrease is primarily due to the impact of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act, and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions upon the completion of tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations with certain taxing jurisdictions. Under ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock compensation are now recognized as income tax benefit or expense, respectively, in the income state instead of additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information about our adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the impact of the Tax Act.\nThe \"Other\" category in our effective tax rate consists of a variety of permanent differences, none of which were individually significant.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nInformation with respect to the results of operations for each of our reportable segments may be found under Note 23 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, processing and settlement service revenues and interchange revenues, as well as contra-revenue items:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Card revenues and other fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing and settlement service revenues\n</td> <td>184,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange revenues\n</td> <td>196,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based retailer incentive compensation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>718,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues and other fees totaled $337.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $19.7 million, or 6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was driven by a shift in the mix of our active card portfolio toward higher revenue generating customers as compared to 2015 and improved unit economics on our new suite of prepaid card products, which increased monthly maintenance fees and ATM fees earned, partially offset by lower new card fees for the comparable periods. These factors have contributed to the year-over-year growth in revenue per active card, which we define as operating revenues for our Account Services segment divided by the number of active cards in each case for or as of the applicable period end, despite a 8% decline in the number of active cards from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues totaled $184.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.7 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The number of cash transfers sold and tax refund transfers processed each decreased year-over-year. In each case, the decline in transactions was partially offset by higher revenue per transaction. The number of cash transfers sold decreased year-over-year due to the suspension of our MoneyPak PIN product, which was discontinued in the first quarter of 2015 and reintroduced in a different format in April 2016.\nInterchange Revenues - Interchange revenues totaled $196.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Despite year-over-year growth of 2% in purchase volume, we earned a lower effective interchange rate on purchase volume due to a mix shift of purchase volume routed by certain merchants to lower revenue generating payment networks than in the prior year.\nStock-based Retailer Incentive Compensation - As a result of our repurchase right lapsing in May 2015, we had no stock-based retailer incentive compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn May 2010, we issued to Walmart 2,208,552 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to our right to repurchase them at $0.01 per share upon a qualifying termination of our prepaid card program agreement with Walmart. Prior to May 2015, we recognized each month the fair value of the 36,810 shares issued to Walmart as to which our right to repurchase lapsed using the then-current fair market value of our Class A common stock. We recorded the fair value recognized as stock-based retailer incentive compensation, a contra-revenue component of our total operating revenues. Beginning in May 2015, we no longer record stock-based retailer compensation as a result of our repurchase right lapsing completely.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses:\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>230,441\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation and benefits expenses\n</td> <td>159,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>168,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing expenses\n</td> <td>107,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102,144\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>139,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>655,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>635,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses totaled $249.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $18.7 million, or 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of $11.4 million of incremental costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages as a result of the continued introduction of our new suite of prepaid card products with improved unit economics at our retail distributors. Sales and marketing expenses also increased due to an increase in sales commission expenses due in part to the impact of the increased sales commission rate we pay Walmart under the new agreement executed in May 2015 being applied to sales for the entire year ended December 31, 2016 compared to eight months of the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses - Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $159.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $8.7 million or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Salaries and wages decreased by approximately $5.4 million and third party contractor expenses decreased by approximately $3.8 million, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses totaled $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.5 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to our growth in period-over-period purchase volume of 2%, higher fees charged to us by our payment networks for ATM and purchase transactions and lower bonus incentives received from our payment networks compared to the prior year. As discussed under \"Financial Results and Trends,\" we incurred additional processing expenses during the second half of the year ended December 31, 2016 due to delays in the planned migration schedule to our new third party processor.\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses totaled $139.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.8 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Other general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to year-over-year increases in cardholder transaction losses of $3.6 million, and a year-over-year decrease of $5.7 million in gains associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration. These increases were offset by an absence in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we recorded $5.7 million associated with the write down of certain internal-use software during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our effective tax rate among federal, state and other:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. federal statutory tax rate\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State income taxes, net of federal tax benefit\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General business credits\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur income tax expense increased by $0.3 million to $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in income before income taxes. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 from 33.9% to 32.4% is primarily attributable to the reversal of previously accrued tax positions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of statute of limitations and settlement with certain taxing jurisdictions.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nInformation with respect to the results of operations for each of our reportable segments may be found under Note 23 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nCapital Requirements for Bank Holding Companies\nOur subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and our primary regulators are the Federal Reserve Board and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators approved final rules regarding new risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards, known as Basel III.\u201d The Basel III rules, which became effective for us and our bank on January 1, 2015, are subject to certain phase-in periods that occur over several years. The U.S. Basel III rules contain new capital standards that change the composition of capital, increase minimum capital ratios and strengthen counter-party credit risk capital requirements. The Basel III rules also include a new definition of common equity Tier 1 capital and require that certain levels of such common equity Tier 1 capital be maintained. The rules also include a new capital conservation buffer, which impose a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress, and could result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses under certain circumstances, as well as a new standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Under the Basel III rules, we must maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were categorized as \"well capitalized\" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as \"well capitalized,\" we must maintain specific total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since December 31, 2017 which management believes would have changed our category as \"well capitalized.\"\nThe definitions associated with the amounts and ratios below are as follows:\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Definition\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 leverage ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tier 1 capital divided by average total assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Common equity Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Tier 1 capital divided by risk-weighted assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total risk-based capital ratio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total capital divided by risk-weighted assets\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Definition\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital and\nCommon equity Tier 1 capital\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Primarily includes common stock, retained earnings and accumulated OCI, net of deductions and adjustments primarily related to goodwill, deferred tax assets and intangibles.

year-over-year decline in the capital ratios of Green Dot Corporation was primarily driven by the acquisition of UniRush in February 2017 as goodwill and intangible assets acquired reduce common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital. Additionally, our regulatory capital decreased as a result of our $50 million ASR completed in 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>218,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(223,930\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78,291\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(175,718\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>192,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(75,677\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>66,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>186,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(39,453\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we financed our operations primarily through our cash flows provided by operating activities. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we financed certain investing activities through our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, our primary source of liquidity was unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $919.2 million. We also consider our $153.5 million of investment securities available-for-sale to be highly-liquid instruments.\nWe use trend and variance analysis as well as our detailed budgets and forecasts to project future cash needs, making adjustments to the projections when needed. We believe that our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service requirements and any other capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur $218.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 principally resulted from $85.9 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $102.8 million and an increase in our net changes in working capital assets and liabilities of $29.6 million, driven principally by the timing of payments of our accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our $114.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 principally resulted from $41.6 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $92.6 million, offset by a decrease in our net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $19.7 million, driven primarily by a decrease in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in tax payments made during the year. Our $156.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 principally resulted from $38.4 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $91.2 million, and an increase in our net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $27.3 million, driven primarily by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and income taxes receivable.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur $223.9 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflects payment for our acquisition of UniRush, LLC of $141.5 million, net of cash acquired, and an increase of $78.8 million in our restricted cash balances associated with the timing of funds required at year end to collateralize a prefunding obligation with a business partner and payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $44.1 million, offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale investment securities, net of purchases, of $53.0 million. Our $78.3 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflects payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $43.3 million, and purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, of $28.9 million. Our $175.7 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects payments for business acquisitions of $65.2 million, net of cash acquired, payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $47.8 million, and purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of $62.7 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur $192.2 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of a $284.8 million net increase in deposits associated with our card programs and $24.2 million from stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds, offset by $52.0 million used for our stock repurchase program, $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable, $18.1 million in taxes paid from net settled equity awards, and a $20.9 million decrease in obligations to our customers. Our $75.7 million of net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of an $83.4 million decrease in obligations to customers, $59.0 million used for our stock repurchase program, $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable, and $8.2 million in taxes paid from net settled equity awards, offset by increases of $85.3 million in deposits to customers associated\nwith our GPR card program and $14.9 million from stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds. Our $66.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of increases of $86.7 million of deposits to customers associated with our GPR card program and $45.4 million in obligations to customers, offset by $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable and $41.0 million used for our stock repurchase program.\nCommitments\nWe anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment as necessary in the normal course of our business. The amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees, the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook. During 2018, we intend to continue to invest in new products and programs, new features for our existing products and IT infrastructure to scale and operate effectively to meet our strategic objectives. We expect these capital expenditures will exceed the amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 as we reinvest a portion of the incremental cash flow we expect to generate as a result of the Tax Act and the expected lower effective tax rate.\nWe have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies and we anticipate that we may continue to do so in the future. The nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements. We may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions. As discussed above in Note 3-Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, on February 28, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all the membership interests of UniRush for $142.2 million plus a minimum $4 million annual earn-out payment for five years following the closing. The earn-out payments will be made each year, with the minimum payment potentially becoming greater if certain revenue growth targets for the RushCard GPR card program are met in a given year, although any potential increase is not expected to be material to the overall purchase price.\nAdditionally, we may make periodic cash contributions to our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, to maintain its capital, leverage and other financial commitments at levels we have agreed to with our regulators.\nSenior Credit Facility\nIn October 2014, we entered into a $225 million credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and other lenders party thereto. The agreement provides for (i) a $75 million five-year revolving facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year $150 million term loan facility (the Term Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Facility, the Senior Credit Facility\u201d). At our election, loans made under the credit agreement bear interest at (1) a LIBOR rate or (2) a base rate as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin (4.32% as of December 31, 2017). The balance outstanding on the Term Facility was $79.6 million at December 31, 2017, net of deferred financing fees. Quarterly principal payments of $5.6 million are payable on the loans under the Term Facility. The loans made under the Term Facility mature and all amounts then outstanding thereunder are payable on October 23, 2019. There were no borrowings on the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017. We are also subject to certain financial covenants, which include maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter, as defined in the agreement, as amended. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn June 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $150 million of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we have completed our commitment to repurchase shares under this repurchase program authorization.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (\"ASR\") with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our common stock as part of our repurchase program. Under the ASR agreement, we purchased $40 million of our Class A common stock at an average price of $17.08 per share, resulting in approximately 2.4 million shares. We also entered into a $10 million agreement to repurchase shares under a Rule10b5-1 plan during the year ended December 31, 2015. Under this agreement, we received approximately 0.6 million shares at an average price of $16.15.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution for the purchase of an additional $50 million of our Class A common stock. Under this ASR agreement, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of $22.54 per share.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution for the remaining $50 million of our Class A common stock authorized for repurchase. Under this ASR agreement, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares at an average price of $38.64.\nIn May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized, subject to regulatory approval, expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $150 million. In light of the number of new enterprise-level programs now planned to launch in early 2018 that may require additional capital to support our internal and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, management and our Board of Directors do not intend to seek regulatory approval until such time we believe capital levels are ample to support a repurchase program, which we believe would be, at the earliest, in the latter part of 2018.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations, including both on and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations, at December 31, 2017. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances.\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>32,233\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td>42,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,123\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>157,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Primarily future minimum payments under agreements with vendors and our retail distributors.

Business, we became a bank holding company in December 2011. This section presents information required by the SEC's Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.\u201d The tables in this section include Green Dot Bank information

had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period. We had 5.26 million, 4.13 million, and 4.50 million active cards outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the overall size and scale of our GPR card portfolio and an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services. The increase in the number of active cards of 27% was driven by our acquisition of UniRush, as well as a 4% year-over-year increase in the number of active cards in our organic portfolio. The fourth quarter of 2017 marks the second consecutive quarter in which we have achieved year-over-year growth in organic active cards since the discontinuation of the original MoneyPak PIN product in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn October 2014, we entered into a $225 million credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and other lenders party thereto. The agreement provides for (i) a $75 million five-year revolving facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year $150 million term loan facility (the Term Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Facility, the Senior Credit Facility\u201d). At our election, loans made under the credit agreement bear interest at (1) a LIBOR rate or (2) a base rate as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin (4.32% as of December 31, 2017). The balance outstanding on the Term Facility was $79.6 million at December 31, 2017, net of deferred financing fees. Quarterly principal payments of $5.6 million are payable on the loans under the Term Facility. The loans made under the Term Facility mature and all amounts then outstanding thereunder are payable on October 23, 2019. There were no borrowings on the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017. We are also subject to certain financial covenants, which include maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter, as defined in the agreement, as amended.

To the extent we act as a principal in the transaction, we report revenues on a gross basis. In concluding whether or not we act as a principal or an agent, we evaluate whether we have the substantial risks and rewards under the terms of the revenue-generating arrangements, whether we are the party responsible for fulfillment of the services purchased by the cardholders, and other factors. For most of our significant revenue-generating arrangements, including GPR and gift cards, we recognize revenues on a gross basis. As it relates to our tax refund processing services, we act as an agent in these transactions and record revenues on a net basis.\n\nStep 6: Return capital to shareholders through share buy-backs.\n\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>890,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>718,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>791,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>655,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>85,887\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Due in one year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after one year through five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after five years through ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Due after ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate bonds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>92,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>121,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Municipal bonds\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>742\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total fixed-income securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,952\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>93,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>143,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average yield\n</td> <td>1.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.55\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur $192.2 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of a $284.8 million net increase in deposits associated with our card programs and $24.2 million from stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds, offset by $52.0 million used for our stock repurchase program, $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable, $18.1 million in taxes paid from net settled equity awards, and a $20.9 million decrease in obligations to our customers.

The increase was driven by a shift in the mix of our active card portfolio toward higher revenue generating customers as compared to 2015 and improved unit economics on our new suite of prepaid card products, which increased monthly maintenance fees and ATM fees earned, partially offset by lower new card fees for the comparable periods. These factors have contributed to the year-over-year growth in revenue per active card, which we define as operating revenues for our Account Services segment divided by the number of active cards in each case for or as of the applicable period end, despite a 8% decline in the number of active cards from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of Green Dot Bank's investment portfolio at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% of Total\nOperating Revenues\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Card revenues and other fees\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>337,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>318,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Processing and settlement service revenues\n</td> <td>184,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>182,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interchange revenues\n</td> <td>196,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,523\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based retailer incentive compensation\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>718,774\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>694,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs the regulated entity and issuing bank for substantially all products and services we provide, whether our own or on behalf of a BaaS platform partner, we are directly accountable for all aspects of each program's integrity, inclusive of ensuring the program's compliance with all applicable banking regulations, applicable state and federal law and our various internal governance policies and procedures related to all areas of risk and compliance, in addition to deploying enterprise-class risk management practices and procedures to ensure each program's initial and ongoing safety and soundness.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nThe following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data for our banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and average balance data for the period ended December 31, 2015:\n\nStatistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses totaled $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $16.2 million, or 12%, from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases of $8.3 million of professional fees, $8.1 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets driven by the acquisition of UniRush, $5.8 million in transaction losses correlated with the increase in purchase volume, a $3.5 million expense in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit, $2.3 million of telecommunication expenses and $1.2 million of impairment charges related to internal-use software. These increases were partially offset by a year-over-year increase of $7.2 million in gains associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration, principally related to acquisition of our tax refund processing business, and a decrease of $6.0 million in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment.\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, processing and settlement service revenues and interchange revenues:\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses:\nIn May 2010, we issued to Walmart 2,208,552 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to our right to repurchase them at $0.01 per share upon a qualifying termination of our prepaid card program agreement with Walmart. Prior to May 2015, we recognized each month the fair value of the 36,810 shares issued to Walmart as to which our right to repurchase lapsed using the then-current fair market value of our Class A common stock. We recorded the fair value recognized as stock-based retailer incentive compensation, a contra-revenue component of our total operating revenues. Beginning in May 2015, we no longer record stock-based retailer compensation as a result of our repurchase right lapsing completely.\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses totaled $139.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.8 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Other general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to year-over-year increases in cardholder transaction losses of $3.6 million, and a year-over-year decrease of $5.7 million in gains associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration. These increases were offset by an absence in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we recorded $5.7 million associated with the write down of certain internal-use software during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our effective tax rate among federal, state and other:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n (1) Primarily future minimum payments under agreements with vendors and our retail distributors. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition to the above contractual obligations, our definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests of UniRush provides for a minimum $4 million annual earn-out payment for five years following the closing.\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses totaled $249.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $18.7 million, or 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of $11.4 million of incremental costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages as a result of the continued introduction of our new suite of prepaid card products with improved unit economics at our retail distributors. Sales and marketing expenses also increased due to an increase in sales commission expenses due in part to the impact of the increased sales commission rate we pay Walmart under the new agreement executed in May 2015 being applied to sales for the entire year ended December 31, 2016 compared to eight months of the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized, subject to regulatory approval, expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $150 million. In light of the number of new enterprise-level programs now planned to launch in early 2018 that may require additional capital to support our internal and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, management and our Board of Directors do not intend to seek regulatory approval until such time we believe capital levels are ample to support a repurchase program, which we believe would be, at the earliest, in the latter part of 2018.\nWe review a number of metrics to help us monitor the performance of, and identify trends affecting, our business. We believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual revenues.\nInformation with respect to the results of operations for each of our reportable segments may be found under Note 23 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nCapital Requirements for Bank Holding Companies\nKey Financial Ratios\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution for the remaining $50 million of our Class A common stock authorized for repurchase. Under this ASR agreement, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares at an average price of $38.64.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nPurchase Volume - represents the total dollar volume of purchase transactions made by customers using our GPR, checking account and gift card products. This metric excludes the dollar volume of ATM withdrawals. Our purchase volume was $21.6 billion, $16.3 billion, and $16.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We use this metric to analyze interchange revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. The increase in purchase volume of 32% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable prior year period was driven by an increase in gross dollar volume, as described above, our acquisition of UniRush and higher purchase volume per number of active cards as a result of the increasing quality of customers within our active card base.\n\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the commissions we pay to our retail distributors, brokers and platform partners, advertising and marketing expenses, and the costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages, placards and promotional materials to our retail distributors and personalized GPR and GoBank cards to consumers who have activated their cards. We generally establish commission percentages in long-term distribution agreements with our retail distributors and platform partners. Aggregate commissions with our retail distributors are determined by the number of prepaid cards, checking account products and cash transfers sold at their respective retail stores. Commissions with our platform partners and, in certain cases, our retail distributors are determined by the revenue generated from the ongoing use of the associated card programs. We incur advertising and marketing expenses for television, sponsorships, online and in-store promotions. Advertising and marketing expenses are recognized as incurred and typically deliver a benefit over an extended period of time. For this reason, these expenses do not always track changes in our operating revenues. Our manufacturing and distribution costs vary primarily based on the number of GPR and GoBank accounts activated by consumers.\nOur aggregate monthly maintenance fee revenues vary primarily based upon the number of active cards in our portfolio and the average fee assessed per account. Our average monthly maintenance fee per active card depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and upon the extent to which fees are waived based on various incentives provided to customers in an effort to encourage higher usage and retention. Our aggregate ATM fee revenues vary based upon the number of cardholder ATM transactions and the average fee per ATM transaction. The average fee per ATM transaction depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and the extent to which cardholders use ATMs within our free network that carry no fee for cash withdrawal transactions. Our aggregate new card fee revenues vary based upon the number of GPR cards and checking accounts activated and the average new card fee. The average new card fee depends primarily upon the mix of products that we sell since there are variations in new account fees based on the product and/or the location or source where our products are purchased. Our aggregate other fees vary primarily based upon account sales of all types, gift card sales, purchase transactions and the number of active accounts in our portfolio.\n\nFinancial Results and Trends\n (1) Non-performing loans and leases are included in the respective average loan and lease balances. Income, if any, on such loans and leases is recognized on a cash basis. \nWe recognize revenue when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product is sold or the service is performed, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\nKey components of our results of operations\n\nStep 1: Deploy new acquisition and retention strategies to reduce the year-over-year sequential quarterly loss in active cards and return to active card growth in 2018.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 20.8% over the prior year. This is principally a result of the acquisition of UniRush and higher sales and marketing expenses attributable to the year-over-year increase in organic operating revenues generated from products that are subject to revenue share payments to our distributors. Additionally, processing expenses increased as a result of higher transactional usage per active card within our organic portfolio, as processing fees are generally charged on a per transaction basis.\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues totaled $217.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $33.2 million, or 18%, from the comparable prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by a higher volume and revenues earned per cash transfer and tax refund processed, as well as a year-over-year increase in disbursement revenues associated with our Simply Paid Uber program.\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses consist primarily of the fees charged to us by the payment networks, which process transactions for us, the third-party card processors that maintains the records of our customers' accounts and processes transaction authorizations and postings for us and the third-party banks that issue our accounts. These costs generally vary based on the total number of active accounts in our portfolio and gross dollar volume transacted by those accounts. Also included in processing expenses are bank fees associated with our tax refund processing services and gateway and network fees associated with our Simply Paid disbursement services. Bank fees generally vary based on the total number of tax refund transfers processed and gateway and network fees vary based on the numbers of disbursements made.\nInformation with respect to the results of operations for each of our reportable segments may be found under Note 23 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\n (1) The change in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns.  Investment Portfolio\nStep 2: Secure additional shelf space for the new MoneyPak and launch at least one unique and compelling new MoneyPak use case to expand the total available market.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses:\n\nIn February 2017, we announced our 2017 Six Step Plan (the \"2017 Plan\") outlining our strategy to grow revenue, reduce expenses and appropriately allocate capital, all with the objective of driving EPS growth. The following describes each of the six steps within the 2017 Plan.\nAdditionally, we may make periodic cash contributions to our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, to maintain its capital, leverage and other financial commitments at levels we have agreed to with our regulators.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we financed our operations primarily through our cash flows provided by operating activities. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we financed certain investing activities through our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, our primary source of liquidity was unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $919.2 million. We also consider our $153.5 million of investment securities available-for-sale to be highly-liquid instruments.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators approved final rules regarding new risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards, known as Basel III.\u201d The Basel III rules, which became effective for us and our bank on January 1, 2015, are subject to certain phase-in periods that occur over several years. The U.S. Basel III rules contain new capital standards that change the composition of capital, increase minimum capital ratios and strengthen counter-party credit risk capital requirements. The Basel III rules also include a new definition of common equity Tier 1 capital and require that certain levels of such common equity Tier 1 capital be maintained. The rules also include a new capital conservation buffer, which impose a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress, and could result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses under certain circumstances, as well as a new standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Under the Basel III rules, we must maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.\n\nSenior Credit Facility\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses - Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $35.2 million or 22%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of higher salaries and wages and third-party contractor expenses of $16.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, driven by our acquisition of UniRush, and a $12.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nWe have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies and we anticipate that we may continue to do so in the future. The nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements. We may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions. As discussed above in Note 3-Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, on February 28, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all the membership interests of UniRush for $142.2 million plus a minimum $4 million annual earn-out payment for five years following the closing. The earn-out payments will be made each year, with the minimum payment potentially becoming greater if certain revenue growth targets for the RushCard GPR card program are met in a given year, although any potential increase is not expected to be material to the overall purchase price.\nWe also defer and expense commissions paid to retail distributors related to new card sales ratably over the average card lifetime, which is currently five months for our GPR cards and six months for gift cards.\nWe successfully completed and exceeded our expectations for each of the six steps by the end of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nStep 5: Continue to look for new acquisitions that are strategic, synergistic and accretive.\nRevenue Recognition\nRefer to Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information about our adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the impact of the Tax Act.\nStock-Based Compensation\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses totaled $161.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $53.4 million, or 50%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was principally the result of our acquisition of UniRush, a higher volume of purchase and ATM transactions initiated by our cardholders and a higher volume of disbursement services, partially offset by a $6.5 million repayment of incremental processing expenses incurred during the first half of 2017 associated with our need to continue to support customer accounts on our legacy third-party card processor as discussed above.\n2017 Six Step Plan\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nStep 3: Make investments in growing the successful new initiatives launched in 2016, while making modest investments in a new crop of high-potential initiatives that can drive future growth.\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues consist of monthly maintenance fees, ATM fees, new card fees and other revenues. We charge maintenance fees on GPR cards, checking accounts and certain cash transfer products, such as MoneyPak, pursuant to the terms and conditions in our customer agreements. We charge ATM fees to cardholders when they withdraw money at certain ATMs in accordance with the terms and conditions in our cardholder agreements. We charge new card fees, if applicable, when a consumer purchases a GPR card, gift card, or a checking account product. Other revenues consist primarily of revenue associated with our gift card program, annual fees associated with our secured credit card portfolio, transaction-based fees and fees associated with optional products or services, which we offer to cardholders from time to time.\nCommitments\nOur $223.9 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflects payment for our acquisition of UniRush, LLC of $141.5 million, net of cash acquired, and an increase of $78.8 million in our restricted cash balances associated with the timing of funds required at year end to collateralize a prefunding obligation with a business partner and payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $44.1 million, offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale investment securities, net of purchases, of $53.0 million. Our $78.3 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflects payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $43.3 million, and purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, of $28.9 million. Our $175.7 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects payments for business acquisitions of $65.2 million, net of cash acquired, payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $47.8 million, and purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of $62.7 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nTotal operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 23.8% over the prior year. This is a result of double digit organic revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2017 and our acquisition of UniRush, which closed on February 28, 2017. In our Account Services segment, organic revenue growth was driven in part by the continued trend of an improving mix in our active card portfolio toward higher revenue generating customers as compared to the prior year, improved unit economics on our new suite of prepaid card products, a higher proportion of cards that are loaded by direct deposit, and a return to year-over-year growth in the number of active cards in our organic portfolio during the second half of 2017. These factors contributed to an improvement in the quality of our active card portfolio, as evidenced by greater customer engagement through increased gross dollar volume and purchase volume on a year-over-year basis. In our Processing and Settlement Services segment, organic revenues also increased due to a) increased transactions and higher revenue per transaction in our Tax Processing revenue division, b) increased transactions and higher revenue per transaction in our Money Processing revenue division and c) substantially increased transaction volume from our Simply Paid product line.\nThe following table shows certain of Green Dot Bank's key financial ratios for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nWe establish a reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts. We classify overdrawn accounts into age groups based on the number of days since the account last had activity. We then calculate a reserve factor for each age group based on the average recovery rate for the most recent six months. These factors are applied to these age groups to estimate our overall reserve. We rely on these historical rates because they have remained relatively consistent for several years. When more than 90 days have passed without any activity in an account, we consider recovery to be remote and charge off the full amount of the overdrawn account balance against the reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts. Our actual recovery rates and related estimates thereof may change in the future in response to factors such as customer behavior, product pricing and features that impact the frequency and velocity of reloads and other deposits to such accounts.\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nGreen Dot Corporation is a pro-consumer bank holding company and financial technology innovator with a mission to reinvent personal banking for the masses. We employ a unique products and platform\u201d operating model whereby we use our banking and technology assets to design, build and distribute our branded financial services products directly to consumers through a large-scale omni-channel national distribution platform; while also allowing qualified third party partners to access those same banking and technology assets to design, build and distribute their own bespoke financial services directly to their consumers through their own distribution platforms. Through our six revenue divisions and our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, we are a leading provider of prepaid cards, debit cards, checking accounts, secured credit cards, payroll debit cards, consumer cash processing services, wage disbursements and tax refund processing services. With approximately 100,000 major name U.S. retail stores selling our products, several leading direct-to-consumer websites, thousands of tax preparation offices, several apps available in the two leading app stores and distribution through several enterprise-scale Banking as a Service,\u201dor \"BaaS,\" partnerships, we are one of the most broadly distributed banking franchises in the United States. We are headquartered in Pasadena, California, with additional facilities throughout the United States and in Shanghai, China.\nThe definitions associated with the amounts and ratios below are as follows:\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional service fees, telephone and communication costs, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in contingent consideration, transaction losses (losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud), rent and utilities, and insurance. We incur telephone and communication costs primarily from customers contacting us through our toll-free telephone numbers. These costs vary with the total number of active cards in our portfolio, as do losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud. Costs associated with professional services, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment, amortization of our acquired intangible assets, rent and utilities vary based upon our investment in infrastructure, business development, risk management and internal controls and are generally not correlated with our operating revenues or other transaction metrics.\nThe actual amounts and ratios, and required \"well capitalized\" minimum capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2017 and 2016, were as follows:\nDeposits\nKey Metrics\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues consist of cash transfer revenues, tax refund processing service revenues and Simply Paid disbursement revenues. We earn cash transfer revenues when consumers fund their cards through a reload transaction at a Green Dot Network retail location. Our aggregate cash transfer revenues vary based upon the mix of locations where reload transactions occur, since reload fees vary by location. We earn tax refund processing service revenues when a customer of a third party tax preparation company chooses to pay their tax preparation fee through the use of our tax refund processing services. We earn Simply Paid disbursement fees from our business partners as payment disbursements are made.\nTotal operating expenses\n___________\nNumber of Tax Refunds Processed - represents the total number of tax refunds processed in a specified period. We processed 11.17 million, 10.52 million and 10.68 million tax refund transactions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our tax refund processing platform and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services.\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations, including both on and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations, at December 31, 2017. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances.\nOur $218.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 principally resulted from $85.9 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $102.8 million and an increase in our net changes in working capital assets and liabilities of $29.6 million, driven principally by the timing of payments of our accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our $114.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 principally resulted from $41.6 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $92.6 million, offset by a decrease in our net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $19.7 million, driven primarily by a decrease in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in tax payments made during the year. Our $156.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 principally resulted from $38.4 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $91.2 million, and an increase in our net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $27.3 million, driven primarily by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and income taxes receivable.\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOn occasion, we enter into incentive agreements with our retail distributors with the goal of increasing unit sales of our products to consumers. Additionally, we offer various cash-back programs to consumers on select debit and prepaid card programs with the goal of encouraging longer retention and high utilization of those products. We record these incentives, including the issuance of equity instruments, as a reduction of revenues and recognize them over the period the related revenues are recognized or as services are rendered, as applicable.\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses totaled $280.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $31.5 million, or 13% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was the result of an increase of $26.1 million in sales commissions principally associated with higher organic revenues year-over-year generated from products that are subject to revenue-sharing agreements and an increase of $13.2 million in marketing expenses primarily driven by the acquisition of UniRush, partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in cost of materials. The decline in costs of materials relates to our 2016 roll out of our new suite of Green Dot branded prepaid and gift card products at our retailer distributors resulting in incremental costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages; there were no such roll out expenses in 2017.\nOperating Revenues\n\nIncome taxes\nIn June 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $150 million of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we have completed our commitment to repurchase shares under this repurchase program authorization.\nFor performance based awards, we recognize compensation cost for the restricted stock units if and when we conclude it is probable that the performance will be satisfied, over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of the stock. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compensation expense based on the probability assessment. For market based restricted stock units, we base compensation expense on the fair value estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation or similar lattice model. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period regardless of the market condition being satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided, since the estimated grant date fair value already incorporates the probability of outcomes that the market condition will be achieved.\nIn this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, Green Dot,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to Green Dot Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business, we became a bank holding company in December 2011. This section presents information required by the SEC's Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.\u201d The tables in this section include Green Dot Bank information only.\nThe \"Other\" category in our effective tax rate consists of a variety of permanent differences, none of which were individually significant.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were categorized as \"well capitalized\" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as \"well capitalized,\" we must maintain specific total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since December 31, 2017 which management believes would have changed our category as \"well capitalized.\"\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our effective tax rate among federal, state and other:\nwith our GPR card program and $14.9 million from stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds. Our $66.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of increases of $86.7 million of deposits to customers associated with our GPR card program and $45.4 million in obligations to customers, offset by $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable and $41.0 million used for our stock repurchase program.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, processing and settlement service revenues and interchange revenues, as well as contra-revenue items:\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturities for Green Dot Bank's time deposits portfolio greater than $100,000 at December 31, 2017:\nOperating Revenues\nInterchange Revenues - We earn interchange revenues from fees remitted by the merchant's bank, which are based on rates established by the payment networks, when customers make purchase transactions using our products. Our aggregate interchange revenues vary based primarily on the number of active cards in our portfolio, the average transactional volume of the active cards in our portfolio and on the mix of cardholder purchases between those using signature identification technologies and those using personal identification numbers and the corresponding rates.\n___________\nInterchange Revenues - Interchange revenues totaled $257.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $61.3 million or 31%, from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to year-over-year growth in purchase volume, driven by our acquisition of UniRush and higher purchase volume per number of active cards as a result of the increasing quality of customers within our active card base.\nWe defer and recognize new card fee revenues on a straight-line basis over the period commensurate with our service obligation to our customers. We consider the service obligation period to be the average card lifetime. We determine the average card lifetime for each pool of homogeneous products (e.g., products that exhibit the same characteristics such as nature of service and terms and conditions) based on company-specific historical data. Currently, we determine the average card lifetime separately for our GPR cards and gift cards. For our GPR cards, we measure the card lifetime as the period of time, inclusive of reload activity, between sale (or activation) of a card and the date of the last positive balance on that card. We analyze GPR cards activated between six and thirty months prior to each balance sheet date. We use this historical look-back period as a basis for determining our average card lifetime because it provides sufficient time for meaningful behavioral trends to develop. Currently, our GPR cards have an average card lifetime of five months. The usage of gift cards is limited to the initial funds loaded to the card. Therefore, we measure these gift cards' lifetime as the redemption period over which cardholders initiate the substantial majority of their\nWe anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment as necessary in the normal course of our business. The amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees, the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook. During 2018, we intend to continue to invest in new products and programs, new features for our existing products and IT infrastructure to scale and operate effectively to meet our strategic objectives. We expect these capital expenditures will exceed the amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 as we reinvest a portion of the incremental cash flow we expect to generate as a result of the Tax Act and the expected lower effective tax rate.\n\nOverview\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe year-over-year decline in the capital ratios of Green Dot Corporation was primarily driven by the acquisition of UniRush in February 2017 as goodwill and intangible assets acquired reduce common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital. Additionally, our regulatory capital decreased as a result of our $50 million ASR completed in 2017.\nThe following table presents the rate/volume variance in interest income and expense for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nOperating Expenses\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues totaled $184.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.7 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The number of cash transfers sold and tax refund transfers processed each decreased year-over-year. In each case, the decline in transactions was partially offset by higher revenue per transaction. The number of cash transfers sold decreased year-over-year due to the suspension of our MoneyPak PIN product, which was discontinued in the first quarter of 2015 and reintroduced in a different format in April 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $7.5 million reduction to our contingent consideration liability associated with an earn-out provision contained in the definitive merger agreement for the acquisition of our tax refund processing business. We recorded the change in fair value as a component of other general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. The third and final performance period under the earn-out provision ended on June 30, 2017. The reduction represents our firm belief that our tax refund processing business did not achieve its earn-out performance target for the fiscal period ending June 30, 2017, and therefore the total potential payout of $26 million has not been accrued on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The parties to the acquisition are attempting to resolve the final earn-out calculation according to the process provided for in the definitive merger agreement, and will likely require a neutral third party to make a final determination. To the extent there is an unfavorable resolution for the earn-out payment, we may be required to make a final earn-out payment of up to $26 million.\nOur income tax expense increased by $0.3 million to $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in income before income taxes. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 from 33.9% to 32.4% is primarily attributable to the reversal of previously accrued tax positions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of statute of limitations and settlement with certain taxing jurisdictions.\nReserve for Uncollectible Overdrawn Accounts\nOur cardholder accounts may become overdrawn as a result of maintenance fee assessments or from purchase transactions that we honor, in each case in excess of the funds in the cardholder's account. While we decline authorization attempts for amounts that exceed the available balance in a cardholder's account, the application of card association rules, the timing of the settlement of transactions and the assessment of the card's monthly maintenance fee, among other things, can result in overdrawn accounts. Overdrawn account balances are deemed to be our receivables due from cardholders, and we include them as a component of accounts receivable, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally recover overdrawn account balances from those cardholders that perform a reload transaction. In addition, we recover some overdrawn account balances related to purchase transaction through enforcement of payment network rules, which allow us to recover the amounts from the merchant where the purchase transaction was conducted. However, we are exposed to losses from any unrecovered overdrawn account balances. The probability of recovering these amounts is primarily related to the number of days that have elapsed since an account had activity, such as a purchase, ATM transaction or fee assessment. Generally, we recover 50-60% of\nWe use trend and variance analysis as well as our detailed budgets and forecasts to project future cash needs, making adjustments to the projections when needed. We believe that our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service requirements and any other capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act\u201d). All statements other than statements of historical facts are statements that could be deemed to be forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industries in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management. Words such as expects,\u201d anticipates,\u201d targets,\u201d goals,\u201d projects,\u201d intends,\u201d plans,\u201d believes,\u201d seeks,\u201d estimates,\u201d continues,\u201d endeavors,\u201d strives,\u201d may\u201d and assumes,\u201d variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. In addition, any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance, our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses, and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward-looking statements. Readers are cautioned that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict, including those identified below, under Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and elsewhere herein. Therefore, actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nGenerally, customers have limited rights to a refund of the new card fee or a cash transfer fee. We have elected to recognize revenues prior to the expiration of the refund period, but reduce revenues by the amount of expected refunds, which we estimate based on actual historical refunds.\nWe record employee stock-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value. For stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, we base compensation expense on fair values estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For stock awards, including restricted stock units, we base compensation expense on the fair value of our Class A common stock at the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for awards with only service conditions that have graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. Vesting is based upon continued service to our company.\nInterchange Revenues - Interchange revenues totaled $196.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Despite year-over-year growth of 2% in purchase volume, we earned a lower effective interchange rate on purchase volume due to a mix shift of purchase volume routed by certain merchants to lower revenue generating payment networks than in the prior year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution for the purchase of an additional $50 million of our Class A common stock. Under this ASR agreement, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of $22.54 per share.\nTotal operating revenues\nNumber of Cash Transfers - represents the total number of reload transactions that we conducted through our retail distributors in a specified period. We processed 38.60 million, 37.79 million, and 38.88 million reload transactions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our retail cash reload network, as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services, and to analyze cash transfer revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. Our cash transfers increased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year primarily due to year-over-year growth in our updated MoneyPak PIN product we began selling in Q2 2016 and our swipe reload service which was driven by the increase in active cards, partially offset by an increase in direct deposit penetration in our active card portfolio as direct deposit customers, on average, perform fewer cash reloads.\nGross Dollar Volume - represents the total dollar volume of funds processed and settled by our consolidated enterprise, excluding tax refunds processed. Our gross dollar volume was $31.8 billion, $23.0 billion, and $22.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our processing infrastructure and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services. The increase in gross dollar volume of 39% during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable prior year period was principally driven by our acquisition of UniRush and higher average gross dollar volume per organic actives during the periods.\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses totaled $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.5 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to our growth in period-over-period purchase volume of 2%, higher fees charged to us by our payment networks for ATM and purchase transactions and lower bonus incentives received from our payment networks compared to the prior year. As discussed under \"Financial Results and Trends,\" we incurred additional processing expenses during the second half of the year ended December 31, 2016 due to delays in the planned migration schedule to our new third party processor.\nIntangible and other long lived-assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of the underlying assets; and significant adverse industry or market economic trends. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable, we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections, which could include, but would not be limited to, future revenues, earnings and the probability of certain outcomes. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2017. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for each of our reporting units as their fair values exceeded their carrying values indicating there was no impairment. No impairment charges were recognized related to goodwill or intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $9.4 million of processing expenses related to the processor conversion challenges encountered in 2016 that resulted in incremental processing charges in excess of our normalized rate. We resolved this matter during the first half of 2017 and did not incur material incremental processing expenses in excess of our normalized rate after June 30, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received approximately $6.5 million as a partial recovery of these costs, which has been recorded as an offset to processing expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.\n___________\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturities, by amortized cost, and average yields for Green Dot Bank's investment portfolio at December 31, 2017:\nWe review the recoverability of goodwill at least annually or whenever significant events or changes occur, which might impair the recovery of recorded costs. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, declines in the market conditions of our products, reductions in our future cash flow estimates, and significant adverse industry or economic market trends, amongst others. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, as necessary. In the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable, we would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections, which could include, but would not be limited to, future revenues, earnings and the probability of certain outcomes.\nWe classify our operating expenses into the following four categories:\nWe measure the fair value of equity instruments issued to non-employees as of the earlier of the date a performance commitment has been reached by the counterparty or the date performance is completed by the counterparty. We determine the fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or the fair value of our Class A common stock, as applicable, and recognize related expense in the same periods that the goods or services are received.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nStep 4: Drive incremental platform savings across the enterprise and achieve savings from integrating the UniRush acquisition over the course of 2017.\nThe following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\ntransactions. Currently, gift cards have an average lifetime of six months. We reassess average card lifetime quarterly. Average card lifetimes may vary in the future as cardholder behavior changes relative to historical experience because customers are influenced by changes in the pricing of our services, the availability of substitute products, and other factors.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (\"ASR\") with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our common stock as part of our repurchase program. Under the ASR agreement, we purchased $40 million of our Class A common stock at an average price of $17.08 per share, resulting in approximately 2.4 million shares. We also entered into a $10 million agreement to repurchase shares under a Rule10b5-1 plan during the year ended December 31, 2015. Under this agreement, we received approximately 0.6 million shares at an average price of $16.15.\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues and other fees totaled $414.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $77.0 million, or 23%, from the comparable prior year period. We believe this increase in revenue reflects the increasing quality of customers within our active card base and improved unit economics on our suite of prepaid card products, which increased monthly maintenance fees and ATM fees earned within our Account Services segment, as well as our acquisition of UniRush on February 28, 2017.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, current circumstances and various other assumptions that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nOur subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and our primary regulators are the Federal Reserve Board and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nOperating Expenses\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, eliminates certain deductions and enhances and extends through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. Although we have not completed our analysis of the tax effects of the Tax Act, we expect our annual effective tax rate will be lower in 2018 as a result of the Tax Act. Our annual effective rate for 2018 is difficult to predict due to a number of factors, including excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, which will vary from quarter to quarter depending on fluctuations in our stock price in each period.\nWe classify our operating revenues into the following three categories:\n", "item_7_text": "Our income tax expense decreased by $2.4 million to $17.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 from the prior year due to a decrease in our effective tax rate from 32.4% to 17.0%. This decrease is primarily due to the impact of our adoption of ASU 2016-09, the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Act, and the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions upon the completion of tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations with certain taxing jurisdictions. Under ASU 2016-09, all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies related to stock compensation are now recognized as income tax benefit or expense, respectively, in the income state instead of additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information about our adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the impact of the Tax Act.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table shows Green Dot Bank's average deposits and the annualized average rate paid on those deposits for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses - Compensation and benefits expenses represent the compensation and benefits that we provide to our employees and the payments we make to third-party contractors. While we have an in-house customer service function, we employ third-party contractors to conduct call center operations, handle routine customer service inquiries and provide consulting support in the area of IT operations and elsewhere. Compensation and benefits expenses associated with our customer service and loss management functions generally vary in line with the size of our active card portfolio, while the expenses associated with other functions do not.\nWe include our provision for uncollectible overdrawn accounts related to maintenance fees and purchase transactions as an offset to card revenues and other fees and in other general and administrative expenses, respectively, in our consolidated statements of operations.\noverdrawn account balances in accounts that have had activity in the last 30 days, less than 15% in accounts that have had activity in the last 30 to 60 days, and less than 10% when more than 60 days have elapsed.\n\nOur income tax expense consists of the federal and state corporate income taxes accrued on income resulting from the sale of our products and services.\nNumber of Active Cards - represents the total number of GPR cards and checking accounts in our portfolio that had a purchase, reload or ATM withdrawal transaction during the previous 90-day period. We had 5.26 million, 4.13 million, and 4.50 million active cards outstanding as of December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the overall size and scale of our GPR card portfolio and an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services. The increase in the number of active cards of 27% was driven by our acquisition of UniRush, as well as a 4% year-over-year increase in the number of active cards in our organic portfolio. The fourth quarter of 2017 marks the second consecutive quarter in which we have achieved year-over-year growth in organic active cards since the discontinuation of the original MoneyPak PIN product in the first quarter of 2015.\nIn October 2014, we entered into a $225 million credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and other lenders party thereto. The agreement provides for (i) a $75 million five-year revolving facility (the Revolving Facility\u201d) and (ii) a five-year $150 million term loan facility (the Term Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Facility, the Senior Credit Facility\u201d). At our election, loans made under the credit agreement bear interest at (1) a LIBOR rate or (2) a base rate as defined in the agreement, plus an applicable margin (4.32% as of December 31, 2017). The balance outstanding on the Term Facility was $79.6 million at December 31, 2017, net of deferred financing fees. Quarterly principal payments of $5.6 million are payable on the loans under the Term Facility. The loans made under the Term Facility mature and all amounts then outstanding thereunder are payable on October 23, 2019. There were no borrowings on the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2017. We are also subject to certain financial covenants, which include maintaining a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter, as defined in the agreement, as amended. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all such covenants.\nWe report our different types of revenues on a gross or net basis based on our assessment of whether we act as a principal or an agent in the transaction. To the extent we act as a principal in the transaction, we report revenues on a gross basis. In concluding whether or not we act as a principal or an agent, we evaluate whether we have the substantial risks and rewards under the terms of the revenue-generating arrangements, whether we are the party responsible for fulfillment of the services purchased by the cardholders, and other factors. For most of our significant revenue-generating arrangements, including GPR and gift cards, we recognize revenues on a gross basis. As it relates to our tax refund processing services, we act as an agent in these transactions and record revenues on a net basis.\n\nStep 6: Return capital to shareholders through share buy-backs.\n\n\nOur $192.2 million of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily the result of a $284.8 million net increase in deposits associated with our card programs and $24.2 million from stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds, offset by $52.0 million used for our stock repurchase program, $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable, $18.1 million in taxes paid from net settled equity awards, and a $20.9 million decrease in obligations to our customers. Our $75.7 million of net cash used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily the result of an $83.4 million decrease in obligations to customers, $59.0 million used for our stock repurchase program, $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable, and $8.2 million in taxes paid from net settled equity awards, offset by increases of $85.3 million in deposits to customers associated\nContractual Obligations\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased $2.4 million from the prior year as a result of a lower effective tax rate. The decline in our rate was primarily due to excess tax benefits as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09 and one-time favorable adjustments to our deferred taxes assets and liabilities, including $6.3 million due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\").\n\nStock-based Retailer Incentive Compensation - As a result of our repurchase right lapsing in May 2015, we had no stock-based retailer incentive compensation for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $2.5 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated organizations or financial partnerships, such as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses - Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $159.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $8.7 million or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Salaries and wages decreased by approximately $5.4 million and third party contractor expenses decreased by approximately $3.8 million, partially offset by an increase of $1.3 million in stock-based compensation expense.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities and Stockholders' Equity\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues and other fees totaled $337.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $19.7 million, or 6%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was driven by a shift in the mix of our active card portfolio toward higher revenue generating customers as compared to 2015 and improved unit economics on our new suite of prepaid card products, which increased monthly maintenance fees and ATM fees earned, partially offset by lower new card fees for the comparable periods. These factors have contributed to the year-over-year growth in revenue per active card, which we define as operating revenues for our Account Services segment divided by the number of active cards in each case for or as of the applicable period end, despite a 8% decline in the number of active cards from the year ended December 31, 2015 to the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe following table presents the amortized cost and fair value of Green Dot Bank's investment portfolio at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nAs the regulated entity and issuing bank for substantially all products and services we provide, whether our own or on behalf of a BaaS platform partner, we are directly accountable for all aspects of each program's integrity, inclusive of ensuring the program's compliance with all applicable banking regulations, applicable state and federal law and our various internal governance policies and procedures related to all areas of risk and compliance, in addition to deploying enterprise-class risk management practices and procedures to ensure each program's initial and ongoing safety and soundness.\n\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\n\nThe following table presents average balance data and interest income and expense data for our banking operations, as well as the related interest yields and rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 and average balance data for the period ended December 31, 2015:\n\nStatistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses totaled $155.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $16.2 million, or 12%, from the comparable prior year period, primarily due to increases of $8.3 million of professional fees, $8.1 million in amortization of acquired intangible assets driven by the acquisition of UniRush, $5.8 million in transaction losses correlated with the increase in purchase volume, a $3.5 million expense in connection with the settlement of a lawsuit, $2.3 million of telecommunication expenses and $1.2 million of impairment charges related to internal-use software. These increases were partially offset by a year-over-year increase of $7.2 million in gains associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration, principally related to acquisition of our tax refund processing business, and a decrease of $6.0 million in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment.\nOperating Revenues\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, processing and settlement service revenues and interchange revenues:\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses:\nIn May 2010, we issued to Walmart 2,208,552 shares of our Class A common stock, subject to our right to repurchase them at $0.01 per share upon a qualifying termination of our prepaid card program agreement with Walmart. Prior to May 2015, we recognized each month the fair value of the 36,810 shares issued to Walmart as to which our right to repurchase lapsed using the then-current fair market value of our Class A common stock. We recorded the fair value recognized as stock-based retailer incentive compensation, a contra-revenue component of our total operating revenues. Beginning in May 2015, we no longer record stock-based retailer compensation as a result of our repurchase right lapsing completely.\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses totaled $139.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $4.8 million, or 4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Other general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to year-over-year increases in cardholder transaction losses of $3.6 million, and a year-over-year decrease of $5.7 million in gains associated with the change in fair value of contingent consideration. These increases were offset by an absence in impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2016, as we recorded $5.7 million associated with the write down of certain internal-use software during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our effective tax rate among federal, state and other:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n (1) Primarily future minimum payments under agreements with vendors and our retail distributors. See Note 19 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.  In addition to the above contractual obligations, our definitive agreement to acquire all of the equity interests of UniRush provides for a minimum $4 million annual earn-out payment for five years following the closing.\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses totaled $249.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $18.7 million, or 8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily the result of $11.4 million of incremental costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages as a result of the continued introduction of our new suite of prepaid card products with improved unit economics at our retail distributors. Sales and marketing expenses also increased due to an increase in sales commission expenses due in part to the impact of the increased sales commission rate we pay Walmart under the new agreement executed in May 2015 being applied to sales for the entire year ended December 31, 2016 compared to eight months of the year ended December 31, 2015.\nIn May 2017, our Board of Directors authorized, subject to regulatory approval, expansion of our stock repurchase program by an additional $150 million. In light of the number of new enterprise-level programs now planned to launch in early 2018 that may require additional capital to support our internal and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements, management and our Board of Directors do not intend to seek regulatory approval until such time we believe capital levels are ample to support a repurchase program, which we believe would be, at the earliest, in the latter part of 2018.\nWe review a number of metrics to help us monitor the performance of, and identify trends affecting, our business. We believe the following measures are the primary indicators of our quarterly and annual revenues.\nInformation with respect to the results of operations for each of our reportable segments may be found under Note 23 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\nCapital Requirements for Bank Holding Companies\nKey Financial Ratios\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution for the remaining $50 million of our Class A common stock authorized for repurchase. Under this ASR agreement, we repurchased approximately 1.3 million shares at an average price of $38.64.\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nPurchase Volume - represents the total dollar volume of purchase transactions made by customers using our GPR, checking account and gift card products. This metric excludes the dollar volume of ATM withdrawals. Our purchase volume was $21.6 billion, $16.3 billion, and $16.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We use this metric to analyze interchange revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. The increase in purchase volume of 32% during the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable prior year period was driven by an increase in gross dollar volume, as described above, our acquisition of UniRush and higher purchase volume per number of active cards as a result of the increasing quality of customers within our active card base.\n\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of the commissions we pay to our retail distributors, brokers and platform partners, advertising and marketing expenses, and the costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages, placards and promotional materials to our retail distributors and personalized GPR and GoBank cards to consumers who have activated their cards. We generally establish commission percentages in long-term distribution agreements with our retail distributors and platform partners. Aggregate commissions with our retail distributors are determined by the number of prepaid cards, checking account products and cash transfers sold at their respective retail stores. Commissions with our platform partners and, in certain cases, our retail distributors are determined by the revenue generated from the ongoing use of the associated card programs. We incur advertising and marketing expenses for television, sponsorships, online and in-store promotions. Advertising and marketing expenses are recognized as incurred and typically deliver a benefit over an extended period of time. For this reason, these expenses do not always track changes in our operating revenues. Our manufacturing and distribution costs vary primarily based on the number of GPR and GoBank accounts activated by consumers.\nOur aggregate monthly maintenance fee revenues vary primarily based upon the number of active cards in our portfolio and the average fee assessed per account. Our average monthly maintenance fee per active card depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and upon the extent to which fees are waived based on various incentives provided to customers in an effort to encourage higher usage and retention. Our aggregate ATM fee revenues vary based upon the number of cardholder ATM transactions and the average fee per ATM transaction. The average fee per ATM transaction depends upon the mix of products in our portfolio at any given point in time and the extent to which cardholders use ATMs within our free network that carry no fee for cash withdrawal transactions. Our aggregate new card fee revenues vary based upon the number of GPR cards and checking accounts activated and the average new card fee. The average new card fee depends primarily upon the mix of products that we sell since there are variations in new account fees based on the product and/or the location or source where our products are purchased. Our aggregate other fees vary primarily based upon account sales of all types, gift card sales, purchase transactions and the number of active accounts in our portfolio.\n\nFinancial Results and Trends\n (1) Non-performing loans and leases are included in the respective average loan and lease balances. Income, if any, on such loans and leases is recognized on a cash basis. \nWe recognize revenue when the price is fixed or determinable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the product is sold or the service is performed, and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\nKey components of our results of operations\n\nStep 1: Deploy new acquisition and retention strategies to reduce the year-over-year sequential quarterly loss in active cards and return to active card growth in 2018.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 20.8% over the prior year. This is principally a result of the acquisition of UniRush and higher sales and marketing expenses attributable to the year-over-year increase in organic operating revenues generated from products that are subject to revenue share payments to our distributors. Additionally, processing expenses increased as a result of higher transactional usage per active card within our organic portfolio, as processing fees are generally charged on a per transaction basis.\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues totaled $217.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $33.2 million, or 18%, from the comparable prior year period. The increase was driven primarily by a higher volume and revenues earned per cash transfer and tax refund processed, as well as a year-over-year increase in disbursement revenues associated with our Simply Paid Uber program.\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses consist primarily of the fees charged to us by the payment networks, which process transactions for us, the third-party card processors that maintains the records of our customers' accounts and processes transaction authorizations and postings for us and the third-party banks that issue our accounts. These costs generally vary based on the total number of active accounts in our portfolio and gross dollar volume transacted by those accounts. Also included in processing expenses are bank fees associated with our tax refund processing services and gateway and network fees associated with our Simply Paid disbursement services. Bank fees generally vary based on the total number of tax refund transfers processed and gateway and network fees vary based on the numbers of disbursements made.\nInformation with respect to the results of operations for each of our reportable segments may be found under Note 23 - Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which information is incorporated herein by reference.\n (1) The change in interest income and expense not solely due to changes in volume or rate has been allocated on a pro-rata basis to the volume and rate columns.  Investment Portfolio\nStep 2: Secure additional shelf space for the new MoneyPak and launch at least one unique and compelling new MoneyPak use case to expand the total available market.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses among sales and marketing, compensation and benefits, processing, and other general and administrative expenses:\n\nIn February 2017, we announced our 2017 Six Step Plan (the \"2017 Plan\") outlining our strategy to grow revenue, reduce expenses and appropriately allocate capital, all with the objective of driving EPS growth. The following describes each of the six steps within the 2017 Plan.\nAdditionally, we may make periodic cash contributions to our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, to maintain its capital, leverage and other financial commitments at levels we have agreed to with our regulators.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 we financed our operations primarily through our cash flows provided by operating activities. Additionally, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we financed certain investing activities through our borrowings under our Senior Credit Facility. At December 31, 2017, our primary source of liquidity was unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling $919.2 million. We also consider our $153.5 million of investment securities available-for-sale to be highly-liquid instruments.\nIn July 2013, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators approved final rules regarding new risk-based capital, leverage and liquidity standards, known as Basel III.\u201d The Basel III rules, which became effective for us and our bank on January 1, 2015, are subject to certain phase-in periods that occur over several years. The U.S. Basel III rules contain new capital standards that change the composition of capital, increase minimum capital ratios and strengthen counter-party credit risk capital requirements. The Basel III rules also include a new definition of common equity Tier 1 capital and require that certain levels of such common equity Tier 1 capital be maintained. The rules also include a new capital conservation buffer, which impose a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress, and could result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses under certain circumstances, as well as a new standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets. Under the Basel III rules, we must maintain a ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8% and a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%.\n\nSenior Credit Facility\nCompensation and Benefits Expenses - Compensation and benefits expenses totaled $194.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $35.2 million or 22%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily the result of higher salaries and wages and third-party contractor expenses of $16.2 million and $3.7 million, respectively, driven by our acquisition of UniRush, and a $12.4 million increase in stock-based compensation expense.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nWe have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies and we anticipate that we may continue to do so in the future. The nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements. We may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions. As discussed above in Note 3-Business Acquisitions to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, on February 28, 2017, we completed our acquisition of all the membership interests of UniRush for $142.2 million plus a minimum $4 million annual earn-out payment for five years following the closing. The earn-out payments will be made each year, with the minimum payment potentially becoming greater if certain revenue growth targets for the RushCard GPR card program are met in a given year, although any potential increase is not expected to be material to the overall purchase price.\nWe also defer and expense commissions paid to retail distributors related to new card sales ratably over the average card lifetime, which is currently five months for our GPR cards and six months for gift cards.\nWe successfully completed and exceeded our expectations for each of the six steps by the end of 2017.\nIncome Tax Expense\nStep 5: Continue to look for new acquisitions that are strategic, synergistic and accretive.\nRevenue Recognition\nRefer to Note 13 - Income Taxes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information about our adoption of ASU 2016-09 and the impact of the Tax Act.\nStock-Based Compensation\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses totaled $161.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $53.4 million, or 50%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was principally the result of our acquisition of UniRush, a higher volume of purchase and ATM transactions initiated by our cardholders and a higher volume of disbursement services, partially offset by a $6.5 million repayment of incremental processing expenses incurred during the first half of 2017 associated with our need to continue to support customer accounts on our legacy third-party card processor as discussed above.\n2017 Six Step Plan\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nStep 3: Make investments in growing the successful new initiatives launched in 2016, while making modest investments in a new crop of high-potential initiatives that can drive future growth.\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues consist of monthly maintenance fees, ATM fees, new card fees and other revenues. We charge maintenance fees on GPR cards, checking accounts and certain cash transfer products, such as MoneyPak, pursuant to the terms and conditions in our customer agreements. We charge ATM fees to cardholders when they withdraw money at certain ATMs in accordance with the terms and conditions in our cardholder agreements. We charge new card fees, if applicable, when a consumer purchases a GPR card, gift card, or a checking account product. Other revenues consist primarily of revenue associated with our gift card program, annual fees associated with our secured credit card portfolio, transaction-based fees and fees associated with optional products or services, which we offer to cardholders from time to time.\nCommitments\nOur $223.9 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily reflects payment for our acquisition of UniRush, LLC of $141.5 million, net of cash acquired, and an increase of $78.8 million in our restricted cash balances associated with the timing of funds required at year end to collateralize a prefunding obligation with a business partner and payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $44.1 million, offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of available-for-sale investment securities, net of purchases, of $53.0 million. Our $78.3 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily reflects payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $43.3 million, and purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities, of $28.9 million. Our $175.7 million of net cash used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects payments for business acquisitions of $65.2 million, net of cash acquired, payments for acquisition of property and equipment of $47.8 million, and purchases of available-for-sale investment securities, net of proceeds from sales and maturities of $62.7 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nTotal operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased 23.8% over the prior year. This is a result of double digit organic revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2017 and our acquisition of UniRush, which closed on February 28, 2017. In our Account Services segment, organic revenue growth was driven in part by the continued trend of an improving mix in our active card portfolio toward higher revenue generating customers as compared to the prior year, improved unit economics on our new suite of prepaid card products, a higher proportion of cards that are loaded by direct deposit, and a return to year-over-year growth in the number of active cards in our organic portfolio during the second half of 2017. These factors contributed to an improvement in the quality of our active card portfolio, as evidenced by greater customer engagement through increased gross dollar volume and purchase volume on a year-over-year basis. In our Processing and Settlement Services segment, organic revenues also increased due to a) increased transactions and higher revenue per transaction in our Tax Processing revenue division, b) increased transactions and higher revenue per transaction in our Money Processing revenue division and c) substantially increased transaction volume from our Simply Paid product line.\nThe following table shows certain of Green Dot Bank's key financial ratios for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\nWe establish a reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts. We classify overdrawn accounts into age groups based on the number of days since the account last had activity. We then calculate a reserve factor for each age group based on the average recovery rate for the most recent six months. These factors are applied to these age groups to estimate our overall reserve. We rely on these historical rates because they have remained relatively consistent for several years. When more than 90 days have passed without any activity in an account, we consider recovery to be remote and charge off the full amount of the overdrawn account balance against the reserve for uncollectible overdrawn accounts. Our actual recovery rates and related estimates thereof may change in the future in response to factors such as customer behavior, product pricing and features that impact the frequency and velocity of reloads and other deposits to such accounts.\nOur results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:\nGreen Dot Corporation is a pro-consumer bank holding company and financial technology innovator with a mission to reinvent personal banking for the masses. We employ a unique products and platform\u201d operating model whereby we use our banking and technology assets to design, build and distribute our branded financial services products directly to consumers through a large-scale omni-channel national distribution platform; while also allowing qualified third party partners to access those same banking and technology assets to design, build and distribute their own bespoke financial services directly to their consumers through their own distribution platforms. Through our six revenue divisions and our subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, we are a leading provider of prepaid cards, debit cards, checking accounts, secured credit cards, payroll debit cards, consumer cash processing services, wage disbursements and tax refund processing services. With approximately 100,000 major name U.S. retail stores selling our products, several leading direct-to-consumer websites, thousands of tax preparation offices, several apps available in the two leading app stores and distribution through several enterprise-scale Banking as a Service,\u201dor \"BaaS,\" partnerships, we are one of the most broadly distributed banking franchises in the United States. We are headquartered in Pasadena, California, with additional facilities throughout the United States and in Shanghai, China.\nThe definitions associated with the amounts and ratios below are as follows:\nOther General and Administrative Expenses - Other general and administrative expenses consist primarily of professional service fees, telephone and communication costs, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment and intangible assets, changes in contingent consideration, transaction losses (losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud), rent and utilities, and insurance. We incur telephone and communication costs primarily from customers contacting us through our toll-free telephone numbers. These costs vary with the total number of active cards in our portfolio, as do losses from customer disputed transactions, unrecovered customer purchase transaction overdrafts and fraud. Costs associated with professional services, depreciation and amortization of our property and equipment, amortization of our acquired intangible assets, rent and utilities vary based upon our investment in infrastructure, business development, risk management and internal controls and are generally not correlated with our operating revenues or other transaction metrics.\nThe actual amounts and ratios, and required \"well capitalized\" minimum capital amounts and ratios at December 31, 2017 and 2016, were as follows:\nDeposits\nKey Metrics\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues consist of cash transfer revenues, tax refund processing service revenues and Simply Paid disbursement revenues. We earn cash transfer revenues when consumers fund their cards through a reload transaction at a Green Dot Network retail location. Our aggregate cash transfer revenues vary based upon the mix of locations where reload transactions occur, since reload fees vary by location. We earn tax refund processing service revenues when a customer of a third party tax preparation company chooses to pay their tax preparation fee through the use of our tax refund processing services. We earn Simply Paid disbursement fees from our business partners as payment disbursements are made.\nTotal operating expenses\n___________\nNumber of Tax Refunds Processed - represents the total number of tax refunds processed in a specified period. We processed 11.17 million, 10.52 million and 10.68 million tax refund transactions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our tax refund processing platform and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services.\nOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations, including both on and off-balance sheet transactions that represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations, at December 31, 2017. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances.\nOur $218.3 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 principally resulted from $85.9 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $102.8 million and an increase in our net changes in working capital assets and liabilities of $29.6 million, driven principally by the timing of payments of our accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Our $114.5 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 principally resulted from $41.6 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $92.6 million, offset by a decrease in our net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $19.7 million, driven primarily by a decrease in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities and an increase in tax payments made during the year. Our $156.9 million of net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 principally resulted from $38.4 million of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash operating expenses of $91.2 million, and an increase in our net changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $27.3 million, driven primarily by an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and income taxes receivable.\nComparison of Consolidated Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOn occasion, we enter into incentive agreements with our retail distributors with the goal of increasing unit sales of our products to consumers. Additionally, we offer various cash-back programs to consumers on select debit and prepaid card programs with the goal of encouraging longer retention and high utilization of those products. We record these incentives, including the issuance of equity instruments, as a reduction of revenues and recognize them over the period the related revenues are recognized or as services are rendered, as applicable.\nSales and Marketing Expenses - Sales and marketing expenses totaled $280.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $31.5 million, or 13% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was the result of an increase of $26.1 million in sales commissions principally associated with higher organic revenues year-over-year generated from products that are subject to revenue-sharing agreements and an increase of $13.2 million in marketing expenses primarily driven by the acquisition of UniRush, partially offset by a decrease of $7.9 million in cost of materials. The decline in costs of materials relates to our 2016 roll out of our new suite of Green Dot branded prepaid and gift card products at our retailer distributors resulting in incremental costs of manufacturing and distributing card packages; there were no such roll out expenses in 2017.\nOperating Revenues\n\nIncome taxes\nIn June 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors had authorized a stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $150 million of common stock. As of December 31, 2017, we have completed our commitment to repurchase shares under this repurchase program authorization.\nFor performance based awards, we recognize compensation cost for the restricted stock units if and when we conclude it is probable that the performance will be satisfied, over the requisite service period based on the grant-date fair value of the stock. We reassess the probability of vesting at each reporting period and adjust compensation expense based on the probability assessment. For market based restricted stock units, we base compensation expense on the fair value estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation or similar lattice model. We recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period regardless of the market condition being satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided, since the estimated grant date fair value already incorporates the probability of outcomes that the market condition will be achieved.\nIn this Annual Report, unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires, Green Dot,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our\u201d refer to Green Dot Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nIncome Tax Expense\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1. Business, we became a bank holding company in December 2011. This section presents information required by the SEC's Industry Guide 3, Statistical Disclosure by Bank Holding Companies.\u201d The tables in this section include Green Dot Bank information only.\nThe \"Other\" category in our effective tax rate consists of a variety of permanent differences, none of which were individually significant.\nAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we were categorized as \"well capitalized\" under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as \"well capitalized,\" we must maintain specific total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since December 31, 2017 which management believes would have changed our category as \"well capitalized.\"\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our effective tax rate among federal, state and other:\nwith our GPR card program and $14.9 million from stock option exercise and employee stock purchase plan proceeds. Our $66.3 million of net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily the result of increases of $86.7 million of deposits to customers associated with our GPR card program and $45.4 million in obligations to customers, offset by $22.5 million in repayments of our note payable and $41.0 million used for our stock repurchase program.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of our operating revenues among card revenues and other fees, processing and settlement service revenues and interchange revenues, as well as contra-revenue items:\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturities for Green Dot Bank's time deposits portfolio greater than $100,000 at December 31, 2017:\nOperating Revenues\nInterchange Revenues - We earn interchange revenues from fees remitted by the merchant's bank, which are based on rates established by the payment networks, when customers make purchase transactions using our products. Our aggregate interchange revenues vary based primarily on the number of active cards in our portfolio, the average transactional volume of the active cards in our portfolio and on the mix of cardholder purchases between those using signature identification technologies and those using personal identification numbers and the corresponding rates.\n___________\nInterchange Revenues - Interchange revenues totaled $257.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $61.3 million or 31%, from the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily due to year-over-year growth in purchase volume, driven by our acquisition of UniRush and higher purchase volume per number of active cards as a result of the increasing quality of customers within our active card base.\nWe defer and recognize new card fee revenues on a straight-line basis over the period commensurate with our service obligation to our customers. We consider the service obligation period to be the average card lifetime. We determine the average card lifetime for each pool of homogeneous products (e.g., products that exhibit the same characteristics such as nature of service and terms and conditions) based on company-specific historical data. Currently, we determine the average card lifetime separately for our GPR cards and gift cards. For our GPR cards, we measure the card lifetime as the period of time, inclusive of reload activity, between sale (or activation) of a card and the date of the last positive balance on that card. We analyze GPR cards activated between six and thirty months prior to each balance sheet date. We use this historical look-back period as a basis for determining our average card lifetime because it provides sufficient time for meaningful behavioral trends to develop. Currently, our GPR cards have an average card lifetime of five months. The usage of gift cards is limited to the initial funds loaded to the card. Therefore, we measure these gift cards' lifetime as the redemption period over which cardholders initiate the substantial majority of their\nWe anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment as necessary in the normal course of our business. The amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees, the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook. During 2018, we intend to continue to invest in new products and programs, new features for our existing products and IT infrastructure to scale and operate effectively to meet our strategic objectives. We expect these capital expenditures will exceed the amount of our capital expenditures in 2017 as we reinvest a portion of the incremental cash flow we expect to generate as a result of the Tax Act and the expected lower effective tax rate.\n\nOverview\nShare Repurchase Program\nThe year-over-year decline in the capital ratios of Green Dot Corporation was primarily driven by the acquisition of UniRush in February 2017 as goodwill and intangible assets acquired reduce common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital. Additionally, our regulatory capital decreased as a result of our $50 million ASR completed in 2017.\nThe following table presents the rate/volume variance in interest income and expense for the year ended December 31, 2017:\nOperating Expenses\nProcessing and Settlement Service Revenues - Processing and settlement service revenues totaled $184.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $1.7 million, or 1%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The number of cash transfers sold and tax refund transfers processed each decreased year-over-year. In each case, the decline in transactions was partially offset by higher revenue per transaction. The number of cash transfers sold decreased year-over-year due to the suspension of our MoneyPak PIN product, which was discontinued in the first quarter of 2015 and reintroduced in a different format in April 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a $7.5 million reduction to our contingent consideration liability associated with an earn-out provision contained in the definitive merger agreement for the acquisition of our tax refund processing business. We recorded the change in fair value as a component of other general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. The third and final performance period under the earn-out provision ended on June 30, 2017. The reduction represents our firm belief that our tax refund processing business did not achieve its earn-out performance target for the fiscal period ending June 30, 2017, and therefore the total potential payout of $26 million has not been accrued on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. The parties to the acquisition are attempting to resolve the final earn-out calculation according to the process provided for in the definitive merger agreement, and will likely require a neutral third party to make a final determination. To the extent there is an unfavorable resolution for the earn-out payment, we may be required to make a final earn-out payment of up to $26 million.\nOur income tax expense increased by $0.3 million to $20.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due to an increase in income before income taxes. The decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 from 33.9% to 32.4% is primarily attributable to the reversal of previously accrued tax positions on uncertain tax positions that were no longer necessary due to the expiration of statute of limitations and settlement with certain taxing jurisdictions.\nReserve for Uncollectible Overdrawn Accounts\nOur cardholder accounts may become overdrawn as a result of maintenance fee assessments or from purchase transactions that we honor, in each case in excess of the funds in the cardholder's account. While we decline authorization attempts for amounts that exceed the available balance in a cardholder's account, the application of card association rules, the timing of the settlement of transactions and the assessment of the card's monthly maintenance fee, among other things, can result in overdrawn accounts. Overdrawn account balances are deemed to be our receivables due from cardholders, and we include them as a component of accounts receivable, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally recover overdrawn account balances from those cardholders that perform a reload transaction. In addition, we recover some overdrawn account balances related to purchase transaction through enforcement of payment network rules, which allow us to recover the amounts from the merchant where the purchase transaction was conducted. However, we are exposed to losses from any unrecovered overdrawn account balances. The probability of recovering these amounts is primarily related to the number of days that have elapsed since an account had activity, such as a purchase, ATM transaction or fee assessment. Generally, we recover 50-60% of\nWe use trend and variance analysis as well as our detailed budgets and forecasts to project future cash needs, making adjustments to the projections when needed. We believe that our current unrestricted cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital, capital expenditure, debt service requirements and any other capital needs for at least the next 12 months.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events and our future results that are subject to the safe harbors created under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act\u201d).

We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements for any reason.\nGenerally, customers have limited rights to a refund of the new card fee or a cash transfer fee. We have elected to recognize revenues prior to the expiration of the refund period, but reduce revenues by the amount of expected refunds, which we estimate based on actual historical refunds.\nWe record employee stock-based compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value. For stock options and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan, we base compensation expense on fair values estimated at the grant date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. For stock awards, including restricted stock units, we base compensation expense on the fair value of our Class A common stock at the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for awards with only service conditions that have graded vesting schedules on a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the award. Vesting is based upon continued service to our company.\nInterchange Revenues - Interchange revenues totaled $196.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $0.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Despite year-over-year growth of 2% in purchase volume, we earned a lower effective interchange rate on purchase volume due to a mix shift of purchase volume routed by certain merchants to lower revenue generating payment networks than in the prior year.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution for the purchase of an additional $50 million of our Class A common stock. Under this ASR agreement, we repurchased approximately 2.2 million shares at an average price of $22.54 per share.\nTotal operating revenues\nNumber of Cash Transfers - represents the total number of reload transactions that we conducted through our retail distributors in a specified period. We processed 38.60 million, 37.79 million, and 38.88 million reload transactions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our retail cash reload network, as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services, and to analyze cash transfer revenue, which is a key component of our financial performance. Our cash transfers increased 2% during the year ended December 31, 2017 over the prior year primarily due to year-over-year growth in our updated MoneyPak PIN product we began selling in Q2 2016 and our swipe reload service which was driven by the increase in active cards, partially offset by an increase in direct deposit penetration in our active card portfolio as direct deposit customers, on average, perform fewer cash reloads.\nGross Dollar Volume - represents the total dollar volume of funds processed and settled by our consolidated enterprise, excluding tax refunds processed. Our gross dollar volume was $31.8 billion, $23.0 billion, and $22.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We review this metric as a measure of the size and scale of our processing infrastructure and as an indicator of customer engagement and usage of our products and services. The increase in gross dollar volume of 39% during the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable prior year period was principally driven by our acquisition of UniRush and higher average gross dollar volume per organic actives during the periods.\nProcessing Expenses - Processing expenses totaled $107.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.5 million, or 5%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was due to our growth in period-over-period purchase volume of 2%, higher fees charged to us by our payment networks for ATM and purchase transactions and lower bonus incentives received from our payment networks compared to the prior year. As discussed under \"Financial Results and Trends,\" we incurred additional processing expenses during the second half of the year ended December 31, 2016 due to delays in the planned migration schedule to our new third party processor.\nIntangible and other long lived-assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Certain factors which may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include, but are not limited to the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of use of the underlying assets; and significant adverse industry or market economic trends. In reviewing for impairment, we compare the carrying value of such assets to the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition. In the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable, we would estimate the fair value of the assets and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections, which could include, but would not be limited to, future revenues, earnings and the probability of certain outcomes. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2017. Based on the results of step one of the annual goodwill impairment test, we determined that step two was not required for each of our reporting units as their fair values exceeded their carrying values indicating there was no impairment. No impairment charges were recognized related to goodwill or intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred approximately $9.4 million of processing expenses related to the processor conversion challenges encountered in 2016 that resulted in incremental processing charges in excess of our normalized rate. We resolved this matter during the first half of 2017 and did not incur material incremental processing expenses in excess of our normalized rate after June 30, 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received approximately $6.5 million as a partial recovery of these costs, which has been recorded as an offset to processing expenses on our consolidated statement of operations.\n___________\nThe following table shows the scheduled maturities, by amortized cost, and average yields for Green Dot Bank's investment portfolio at December 31, 2017:\nWe review the recoverability of goodwill at least annually or whenever significant events or changes occur, which might impair the recovery of recorded costs. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill may not be recoverable, include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, declines in the market conditions of our products, reductions in our future cash flow estimates, and significant adverse industry or economic market trends, amongst others. We test for impairment of goodwill by assessing various qualitative factors with respect to developments in our business and the overall economy and calculating the fair value of a reporting unit using the discounted cash flow method, as necessary. In the event that the carrying value of assets is determined to be unrecoverable, we would estimate the fair value of the reporting unit and record an impairment charge for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. The estimate of fair value requires management to make a number of assumptions and projections, which could include, but would not be limited to, future revenues, earnings and the probability of certain outcomes.\nWe classify our operating expenses into the following four categories:\nWe measure the fair value of equity instruments issued to non-employees as of the earlier of the date a performance commitment has been reached by the counterparty or the date performance is completed by the counterparty. We determine the fair value using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or the fair value of our Class A common stock, as applicable, and recognize related expense in the same periods that the goods or services are received.\nResults of Operations by Segment\nStep 4: Drive incremental platform savings across the enterprise and achieve savings from integrating the UniRush acquisition over the course of 2017.\nThe following table summarizes our major sources and uses of cash for the periods presented:\ntransactions. Currently, gift cards have an average lifetime of six months. We reassess average card lifetime quarterly. Average card lifetimes may vary in the future as cardholder behavior changes relative to historical experience because customers are influenced by changes in the pricing of our services, the availability of substitute products, and other factors.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (\"ASR\") with a financial institution to repurchase shares of our common stock as part of our repurchase program. Under the ASR agreement, we purchased $40 million of our Class A common stock at an average price of $17.08 per share, resulting in approximately 2.4 million shares. We also entered into a $10 million agreement to repurchase shares under a Rule10b5-1 plan during the year ended December 31, 2015. Under this agreement, we received approximately 0.6 million shares at an average price of $16.15.\nCard Revenues and Other Fees - Card revenues and other fees totaled $414.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $77.0 million, or 23%, from the comparable prior year period. We believe this increase in revenue reflects the increasing quality of customers within our active card base and improved unit economics on our suite of prepaid card products, which increased monthly maintenance fees and ATM fees earned within our Account Services segment, as well as our acquisition of UniRush on February 28, 2017.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, current circumstances and various other assumptions that our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. In many instances, we could reasonably use different accounting estimates, and in some instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management's judgments and estimates.\nOur subsidiary bank, Green Dot Bank, is a member bank of the Federal Reserve System and our primary regulators are the Federal Reserve Board and the Utah Department of Financial Institutions. We are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the banking agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on our financial statements. Under capital adequacy guidelines, we must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the assets, liabilities and certain off-balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors.\nOperating Expenses\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings and certain related-party payments, eliminates certain deductions and enhances and extends through 2026 the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions on qualified property. Although we have not completed our analysis of the tax effects of the Tax Act, we expect our annual effective tax rate will be lower in 2018 as a result of the Tax Act. Our annual effective rate for 2018 is difficult to predict due to a number of factors, including excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, which will vary from quarter to quarter depending on fluctuations in our stock price in each period.\nWe classify our operating revenues into the following three categories:\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 128: <table><tr><td> </td>

to 2016 primarily due to lower effective tax rate as a result of adopting ASU 2016-09, remeasurement of deferred tax assets/liabilities due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and release of tax reserves. \n\n- Net income increased by $44.3 million or 106.5% in 2017 compared to 2016, driven by 23.8% increase in total operating revenues and 20.8% increase in total operating expenses. Revenue growth was due to acquisition of UniRush and higher organic revenues. Expenses increased due to UniRush acquisition and higher sales/marketing costs.\n\n- Operating revenues increased due to growth in card revenues, processing revenues, and interchange revenues. This was driven by acquisition of UniRush, improving quality of active card portfolio, and higher purchase volume.\n\n- Operating expenses increased primarily due to UniRush acquisition, higher sales commissions, and increase in processing expenses due to higher transaction volumes. \n\n- Cash flows from operating activities were $218.3 million in 2017, driven by net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and changes in working capital.\n\n- Cash used in investing activities was $223.9 million in 2017, primarily for UniRush acquisition and purchases of property and equipment. \n\n- Cash from financing activities was $192.2 million in 2017, mainly due to increase in card program deposits, offset by stock repurchases and debt repayments.\n\n- At December 31, 2017, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaled $919.2 million."}
