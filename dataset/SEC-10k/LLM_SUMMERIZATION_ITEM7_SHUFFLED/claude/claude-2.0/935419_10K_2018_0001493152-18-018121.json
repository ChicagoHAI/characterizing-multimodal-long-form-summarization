Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOVERVIEW\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Our Business - a general description of our business and the adult nightclub industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Operations Review - an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Liquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of cash flows, aggregate contractual obligations, and an overview of financial position. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOUR BUSINESS\nThe following are our operating segments:\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td>Nightclubs </td> <td> </td> <td>Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and/or operate upscale adult nightclubs serving primarily businessmen and professionals. These nightclubs are in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Beaumont, Longview, Harlingen, Edinburg, Tye, Lubbock, El Paso and Odessa, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Miami Gardens and Pembroke Park, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington Park, Kappa and Chicago, Illinois. No sexual contact is permitted at any of our locations.

We also own an industry trade show, an industry trade publication and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur revenues are derived from the sale of liquor, beer, wine, food, merchandise; service revenues such as cover charges, membership fees, and facility use fees; and other revenues such as commissions from vending and ATM machines, real estate rental, valet parking, and other products and services for both nightclub and restaurant/sports bar operations. Media Group revenues include the sale of advertising content and revenues from our annual Expo convention. Our fiscal year-end is September 30.\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe calculate same-store sales by comparing year-over-year revenues from nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars operating at least 12 full months. We exclude from a particular month's calculation units previously included in the same-store sales base that have closed temporarily for more than 15 days until its next full month of operations. We also exclude from the same-store sales base units that are being reconcepted or are closed due to renovations or remodels. Acquired units are included in the same-store sales calculation as long as they qualify based on the definition stated above. Revenues outside of our Nightclubs and Bombshells reportable segments are excluded from same-store sales calculation.\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets-our brands, financial strength, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and employees-to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareholders.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, we evaluate these accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material.\nA full discussion of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset included in the asset group. If the asset group is not recoverable, the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We define our asset group as an operating club or restaurant location, which is also our reporting unit or the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include management's estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins. If fair value is used to determine an impairment loss, an additional key assumption is the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we impaired one club and one Bombshells by a total of $1.6 million; during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we impaired one club by $385,000; and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we impaired one property held for sale by $1.4 million.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur impairment calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to impairments that could be material. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the estimates or assumptions we used that could cause a material change in our calculated impairment charges.\nFor our goodwill impairment review, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This assessment is based on several factors, including industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, including an assessment of cash flows in comparison to actual and projected results of prior periods. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on our qualitative analysis, or if we elect to skip this step, we perform a Step 1 quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value is determined using market-related valuation models, including earnings multiples, discounted cash flows, and comparable asset market values. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include management's estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins, along with the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. We recognize goodwill impairment in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, based on the results of our Step 1 analysis. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we identified four reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling $4.7 million. No goodwill impairment was recorded in fiscal 2018 and 2016.\nFor indefinite-lived intangibles, specifically SOB licenses, we determine fair value by estimating the multiperiod excess earnings of the asset with key assumptions being similar to those used in the goodwill impairment valuation model. For indefinite-lived tradename, we determine fair value by using the relief from royalty method. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We recorded impairment charges for SOB licenses amounting to $3.1 million in 2018 related to three clubs, $1.4 million in 2017 related to two clubs, and $2.1 million in 2016 related to one club.\nInvestment\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we also fully impaired our remaining investment in Drink Robust amounting to $1.2 million. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. These estimates include depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes, and the deductibility of certain other items, among others. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, additional limitations on the tax deductibility of interest, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. Our federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 24.5% percent and represents a blended income tax rate for the current fiscal year. For fiscal 2019, our federal corporate income tax rate will be 21%.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nAs mentioned in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and in a more detailed discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various suits and claims in the normal course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, the Company's consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\nHighlights from fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 include:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Free cash flow* of $23.2 million compared to $19.3 million, a 20.5% increase </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Revenues of $165.7 million compared to $144.9 million, a 14.4% increase (Nightclubs revenue of $140.1 million compared to $124.7 million, a 12.3% increase; and Bombshells revenue of $24.1 million compared to $18.8 million, a 28.0% increase) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Consolidated same-store sales increase of 4.6% (5.8% increase for Nightclubs and 3.3% decrease for Bombshells) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $2.23 compared to $0.85, a 162.4% increase (non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $2.18 compared to $1.43, a 52.4% increase) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr> <td>* </td> <td>Reconciliation and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures are included under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of this Item.

Other revenues included revenues from Drink Robust in 2018 and 2016, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2016. Drink Robust was later reacquired in March 2018 (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Drink Robust sales were $141,000, $0, and $1.0 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which excludes intercompany sales to Nightclubs and Bombshells units. Media business revenues were $1.4 million, $1.2 million, and $1.0 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, were 82.9%, 84.0%, and 84.7% for the fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Significant contributors to the change in operating expenses as a percent of revenues are explained below.\nCost of goods sold includes cost of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, food, cigars and cigarettes, merchandise, media printing/binding and media. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated cost of goods sold was 13.8%, 14.3%, and 15.2% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See above for breakdown of percentages for each line item of consolidated cost of goods sold as it relates to the respective consolidated revenue line. For the Nightclubs segment, cost of goods sold was 11.8%, 12.7%, and 13.1% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which was primarily caused by the increase in higher-margin service revenue and sales of alcoholic beverages in the sales mix, which partly came from newly acquired clubs. Bombshells cost of goods sold of 24.6%, 24.8%, and 25.3% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was flatter and was not much of a contributor to the consolidated change in cost of goods sold rate.\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated salaries and wages increased by $4.5 million, or 11.3% from 2017 to 2018 and by $2.6 million, or 6.9%, from 2016 to 2017.

The dollar increase from 2016 to 2017 was mainly due to additional corporate headcount to support the commencement of our then-planned timing of franchising effort and a shift to employee status of certain entertainers in Phoenix (as discussed in the Business section above). As a percentage of revenues, consolidated salaries and wages has been decreasing at 26.9%, 27.6%, and 27.8% for fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Nightclubs operating margin was 31.7%, 28.2%, and 29.1% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the closure of underperforming units, fixed expense leverage on increasing same-store sales, and impairment of assets of $3.6 million, $6.5 million, and $2.1 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Bombshells operating margin was 8.5%, 16.4%, and 6.2% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, mainly due to increasing sales partially offset by increasing depreciation expense from higher unit count and impairment of assets of $1.1 million in 2018.\nExcluding the impact of settlement of lawsuits, impairment of assets, gain on patron tax settlement and gain on sale of assets, operating margin for the Nightclub segment would have been 35.1%, 33.1%, and 32.3% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Excluding the impact of impairment of assets, loss on sale of assets and settlement of claims, Bombshells segment operating margin would have been 15.1%, 16.4%, and 13.5% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Refer to discussion on Non-GAAP Measures on page 21.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense increased by $1.2 million from 2017 to 2018, and by $782,000 from 2016 to 2017. The increase in interest expense is due to higher average debt balance partially offset by lower weighted average interest rate.\nWe consider rent plus interest expense as our occupancy costs since most of our debts are for real property where our clubs and restaurants are located. For occupancy cost purposes, we exclude non-real-estate-related interest expense. As a percentage of revenues, total occupancy costs, with its components, are shown below.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total occupancy cost </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes were a benefit of $3.1 million in 2018, an expense of $6.4 million in 2017, and an expense of $2.4 million in 2016.

The Company has a fiscal year end of September 30, so the change to the statutory corporate tax rate results in a blended federal statutory rate of 24.5% for its fiscal year 2018. The increase in state tax effective rate from 2017 to 2018 was mainly caused by the impact of return-to-provision true-up, which has an expense impact in 2018 while having a benefit in 2017.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, due to higher income before tax, our income tax rate has increased to 37%, of which has impacted the fourth quarter with the change in rate from 35% in the first nine months of the year and in prior years. A full year impact in the change in rate of our deferred tax liability has also been recognized in the fourth quarter. The change in deferred tax liability rate for 2017 is due to the 1% increase in our effective tax rate from the increase in the federal rate and also an increase in the states rate. This amount results from increasing by 2% the rate applied to our entire deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the year. The reserve for uncertain tax positions results from an audit of the returns of one of the states in which we operate. As a result of the items discussed above which affected the fiscal year, the fourth quarter effective tax rate rose to 99.6% expense on a pre-tax loss.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recognized a $2.0 million tax benefit representing the net amount to be realized from fiscal 2016 and from amending certain prior year federal tax returns to take available FICA tip tax credits, which were not taken in prior years.\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor non-GAAP financial measures because it describes the operating performance of the Company and helps management and investors gauge our ability to generate cash flow, excluding (or including) some items that management believes are not representative of the ongoing business operations of the Company, but are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Relative to each of the non-GAAP financial measures, we further set forth our rationale as follows:\nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. We calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin by excluding the following items from income from operations and operating margin: amortization of intangibles, gain on settlement of patron tax case, gains or losses on sale of assets, impairment of assets, stock-based compensation, settlement of lawsuits, and gain on insurance. We believe that excluding these items assists investors in evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating income and operating margin without the impact of items that are not a result of our day-to-day business and operations.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share. We calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share by excluding or including certain items to net income attributable to RCIHH common shareholders and diluted earnings per share. Excluded items are: amortization of intangibles, gain on settlement of patron tax case, income tax expense (benefit), impairment charges, gains or losses on sale of assets, stock-based compensation, settlement of lawsuits, costs and charges related to debt refinancing, and gain on insurance. Included item is the non-GAAP provision for current and deferred income taxes, calculated as the tax effect at 24.5%, 37%, and 35% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, effective tax rate of the pre-tax non-GAAP income before taxes. We believe that excluding and including such items help management and investors better understand our operating activities.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by excluding the following items from net income attributable to RCIHH common shareholders: depreciation expense, amortization of intangibles, impairment of assets, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, interest income, gains or losses on sale of assets, settlement of lawsuits, gain on settlement of patron tax case, and gain on insurance. We believe that adjusting for such items helps management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal, state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions. The results are, therefore, without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed. We use adjusted EBITDA as one guideline to assess the unleveraged performance return on our investments. Adjusted EBITDA is also the target benchmark for our acquisitions of nightclubs.\nWe also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td>

In the calculation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we take into consideration the adjustment to net income from assumed conversion of debentures (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. The near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in fiscal 2019. As a result of our expected cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. The Company has not recently raised capital through the issuance of equity securities. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on stockholders' equity. We have a history of borrowing funds in private transactions and from sellers in acquisition transactions and continue to have the ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates in that manner. We also have historically utilized these cash flows to invest in property and equipment, adult nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands):\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September 30, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,031 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,339 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,524 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24,100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,975 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,376 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,405 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,307 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe require capital principally for the acquisition of new clubs, construction of new Bombshells, renovation of older units, and investments in technology. We also utilize capital to repurchase our common stock as part of our share repurchase program based on our capital allocation strategy guidelines and to pay our quarterly dividends.\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had a working capital of $55,000 (excluding the impact of assets held for sale amounting to $2.9 million) compared to negative working capital of $10.6 million as of September 30, 2017 (excluding the impact of assets held for sale amounting to $5.8 million). The increase in working capital is principally due to the following items:\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Operating cash flow for the year; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Net increase in current assets, excluding cash, mainly from prepaid insurance and construction advances; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Partially offset by an increase in current portion of long-term debt. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the seasonality of our businesses and the timing of the balloon payments on our long-term debt, we expect to have low cash levels during fiscal 2019, although we do not expect levels that would compromise our ability to service our debts and maintain normal operating activity. We believe that our current sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth plans not only within the next 12 months, but for the next 18 to 24 months.

The notes pay interest-only in equal monthly installments, with a lump sum principal payment at maturity. Among the promissory notes are two notes with a principal of $450,000 and $200,000. The $450,000 note was in exchange for a $300,000 12% note and the $200,000 note was in exchange for a $100,000 note, both of which were included in the May 1, 2017 financing discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Also included in the $2.35 million borrowing is a $500,000 note borrowed from a related party. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOn December 6, 2018, the Company amended the $5.0 million short-term note payable related to the Scarlett's acquisition, which had a remaining balance of $3.0 million as of December 6, 2018, extending the maturity date from May 8, 2019, as previously amended, to May 8, 2020. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nOther than the debt refinancing and other notes payable financing described in Notes 7 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any event or trend that would potentially significantly affect liquidity. In the event such a trend develops, we believe our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be adequately met by cash flows from operations. In our opinion, working capital is not a true indicator of our financial status. Typically, businesses in our industry carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because businesses in our industry receive substantially immediate payment for sales, with nominal receivables, while inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. Vendors and purveyors often remain flexible with payment terms, providing businesses in our industry with opportunities to adjust to short-term business down turns. We consider the primary indicators of financial status to be the long-term trend of revenue growth, the mix of sales revenues, overall cash flow, profitability from operations, and the level of long-term debt.\nThe following table presents a summary of such indicators (dollars in thousands):\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales of alcoholic beverages </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>57,216 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Sales of food and merchandise </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Service revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,276 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,069 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,468 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>165,748 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>144,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,860 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-8.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,031 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA* </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,348 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,531 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Free cash flow* </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,513 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* See definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow under Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have not established financing other than the notes payable discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise.\nShare Repurchase\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, we buy back shares in the open market or through negotiated purchases, as authorized by our Board of Directors. During fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, we paid for treasury stock amounting to $0, $1.1 million, and $7.3 million representing 0 shares, 89,685 shares, and 747,081 shares, respectively. We have $3.1 million remaining to purchase additional shares as of September 30, 2018.\nFor additional details regarding our Board approved share repurchase plans, please refer to Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nWe have not experienced a material overall impact from inflation in our operations during the past several years. To the extent permitted by competition, we have managed to recover increased costs through price increases and may continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nSEASONALITY\nOur nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September (our fiscal third and fourth quarters) with the strongest operating results occurring during October through March (our fiscal first and second quarters). Our revenues in certain markets are also affected by sporting events that cause unusual changes in sales from year to year.\nGROWTH STRATEGY\nWe believe that our nightclub operations can continue to grow organically and through careful entry into markets and demographic segments with high growth potential. Our growth strategy involves the following: (i) to acquire existing units in locations that are consistent with our growth and income targets and which appear receptive to the upscale club formula we have developed; (ii) to open new units after market analysis; (iii) to franchise our Bombshells brand; (iv) to form joint ventures or partnerships to reduce start-up and operating costs, with us contributing equity in the form of our brand name and management expertise; (v) to develop new club concepts that are consistent with our management and marketing skills; (vi) to develop and open our restaurant concepts as our capital and manpower allow; and (vii) to control the real estate in connection with club operations, although some units may be in leased premises.\nWe believe that Bombshells can grow organically and through careful entry into markets and demographic segments with high growth potential. All six of the currently existing Bombshells are located in Texas. Our growth strategy is to diversify our operations with these units which do not require SOB licenses, which are sometimes difficult to obtain. While we are searching for adult nightclubs to acquire, we are able to also search for restaurant/sports bar locations that are consistent with our income targets.\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring fiscal 2016, we did not acquire any new club, restaurant or investment, in adherence to our capital allocation strategy. We acquired land for $5.9 million for future Bombshells sites. In September 2016, we opened Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar in New York City.\nDuring fiscal 2017, we acquired two clubs, one in Florida (Scarlett's Miami) and another in Illinois (Hollywood Showclub) and certain adjacent real estate for an aggregate purchase price of $30.2 million. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions. We subsequently relaunched Hollywood Showclub as Scarlett's St. Louis.\nDuring fiscal 2018, we reacquired Drink Robust (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements). Also in fiscal 2018, we acquired a club in Kappa, Illinois for $1.5 million, financed by a $1.0 million seller note with interest at 8%. The Kappa transaction provides for the purchase of the real estate for $825,000 and other non-real-estate business assets for $180,000, with goodwill amounting to $495,000. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions.\nWe plan to open four new Bombshells in fiscal 2019, one of which opened in December 2018.\nSubsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we closed on the acquisition of one club in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and another club in Chicago, Illinois. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the acquisitions.\nIn October 2018, the Company sold its nightclub in Philadelphia for a total sales price of $1.0 million, payable $375,000 in cash at closing and a 9% note payable over a 10-year period. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the disposition.\nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new nightclubs and anticipate acquiring new locations that fit our business model as we have done in the past. The acquisition of additional clubs may require us to take on additional debt or issue our common stock, or both. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise. An inability to obtain such additional financing could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy.", "item_7_truncated": " \nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended September

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, we evaluate these accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material.\nThe following common size tables present a comparison of our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the past three fiscal years:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n 41 \n \nIn October 2018, the Company sold its nightclub in Philadelphia for a total sales price of $1.0 million, payable $375,000 in cash at closing and a 9% note payable over a 10-year period.

The increase in working capital is principally due to the following items:\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset included in the asset group. If the asset group is not recoverable, the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We define our asset group as an operating club or restaurant location, which is also our reporting unit or the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include management's estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins. If fair value is used to determine an impairment loss, an additional key assumption is the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we impaired one club and one Bombshells by a total of $1.6 million; during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we impaired one club by $385,000; and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we impaired one property held for sale by $1.4 million.\nOur revenues are derived from the sale of liquor, beer, wine, food, merchandise; service revenues such as cover charges, membership fees, and facility use fees; and other revenues such as commissions from vending and ATM machines, real estate rental, valet parking, and other products and services for both nightclub and restaurant/sports bar operations. Media Group revenues include the sale of advertising content and revenues from our annual Expo convention.

The increase in interest expense is due to higher average debt balance partially offset by lower weighted average interest rate.\nFor additional details regarding our Board approved share repurchase plans, please refer to Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nLegal expenses increased by $512,000, or 16.7%, from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to increased legal activity. Decrease in legal expenses from 2016 to 2017 was negligible.\n\nOur impairment calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to impairments that could be material. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the estimates or assumptions we used that could cause a material change in our calculated impairment charges.\nFor our goodwill impairment review, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This assessment is based on several factors, including industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, including an assessment of cash flows in comparison to actual and projected results of prior periods. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on our qualitative analysis, or if we elect to skip this step, we perform a Step 1 quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value is determined using market-related valuation models, including earnings multiples, discounted cash flows, and comparable asset market values. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include management's estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins, along with the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. We recognize goodwill impairment in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, based on the results of our Step 1 analysis. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we identified four reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling $4.7 million. No goodwill impairment was recorded in fiscal 2018 and 2016.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Computed expected income tax expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>State income taxes, net of federal benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred taxes on subsidiaries acquired/sold </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-6.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Permanent differences </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in deferred tax liability rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-47.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reserve for uncertain tax position </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tax credits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-4.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-15.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-1.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total effective income tax rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-16.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) We have $165,000 of uncertain tax positions recorded in accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2018.

The increases in both years were primarily due to an increase in general liability insurance premiums and additional property insurance.\nOn December 22, 2017, during our first quarter 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted into law, which provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such as a reduction in the statutory federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective from January 1, 2018 forward and changes and limitations to certain tax deductions. The Company has a fiscal year end of September 30, so the change to the statutory corporate tax rate results in a blended federal statutory rate of 24.5% for its fiscal year 2018. The increase in state tax effective rate from 2017 to 2018 was mainly caused by the impact of return-to-provision true-up, which has an expense impact in 2018 while having a benefit in 2017.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,031 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Less: Maintenance capital expenditures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,518 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Free cash flow </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,242 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,513 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 22 \n\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor non-GAAP financial measures because it describes the operating performance of the Company and helps management and investors gauge our ability to generate cash flow, excluding (or including) some items that management believes are not representative of the ongoing business operations of the Company, but are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Relative to each of the non-GAAP financial measures, we further set forth our rationale as follows:\n \nThe components of other charges, net are in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nOUR BUSINESS\nTaxes and permits increased by $1.5 million, or 18.9%, from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increased operating activity and from several sales tax audit settlements.\nTotal operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, were 82.9%, 84.0%, and 84.7% for the fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Significant contributors to the change in operating expenses as a percent of revenues are explained below.\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d that follows. These measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures. </td> </tr>\n 39 \nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new nightclubs and anticipate acquiring new locations that fit our business model as we have done in the past. The acquisition of additional clubs may require us to take on additional debt or issue our common stock, or both. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise. An inability to obtain such additional financing could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, due to higher income before tax, our income tax rate has increased to 37%, of which has impacted the fourth quarter with the change in rate from 35% in the first nine months of the year and in prior years. A full year impact in the change in rate of our deferred tax liability has also been recognized in the fourth quarter. The change in deferred tax liability rate for 2017 is due to the 1% increase in our effective tax rate from the increase in the federal rate and also an increase in the states rate. This amount results from increasing by 2% the rate applied to our entire deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the year. The reserve for uncertain tax positions results from an audit of the returns of one of the states in which we operate. As a result of the items discussed above which affected the fiscal year, the fourth quarter effective tax rate rose to 99.6% expense on a pre-tax loss.\n\n \u2020 Percentages may not foot due to rounding. Percentage of revenue for individual cost of goods sold items pertains to their respective revenue line. \nWe calculate same-store sales by comparing year-over-year revenues from nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars operating at least 12 full months. We exclude from a particular month's calculation units previously included in the same-store sales base that have closed temporarily for more than 15 days until its next full month of operations. We also exclude from the same-store sales base units that are being reconcepted or are closed due to renovations or remodels. Acquired units are included in the same-store sales calculation as long as they qualify based on the definition stated above. Revenues outside of our Nightclubs and Bombshells reportable segments are excluded from same-store sales calculation.\n \nDue to the seasonality of our businesses and the timing of the balloon payments on our long-term debt, we expect to have low cash levels during fiscal 2019, although we do not expect levels that would compromise our ability to service our debts and maintain normal operating activity. We believe that our current sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth plans not only within the next 12 months, but for the next 18 to 24 months. Refer to sections on Debt Financing and Contractual Obligations and Commitments below for a discussion of long-term liquidity and capital resources.\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\n\n * Reconciliation and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures are included under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of this Item. These measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe significant variances in other charges, net are discussed below:\n 40 \nIncome Taxes\nThe significant variances in selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:\n 37 \n\n\n\n 35 \nOther segment revenues. Other revenues included revenues from Drink Robust in 2018 and 2016, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2016. Drink Robust was later reacquired in March 2018 (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Drink Robust sales were $141,000, $0, and $1.0 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which excludes intercompany sales to Nightclubs and Bombshells units. Media business revenues were $1.4 million, $1.2 million, and $1.0 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOur nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September (our fiscal third and fourth quarters) with the strongest operating results occurring during October through March (our fiscal first and second quarters). Our revenues in certain markets are also affected by sporting events that cause unusual changes in sales from year to year.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share. We calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share by excluding or including certain items to net income attributable to RCIHH common shareholders and diluted earnings per share. Excluded items are: amortization of intangibles, gain on settlement of patron tax case, income tax expense (benefit), impairment charges, gains or losses on sale of assets, stock-based compensation, settlement of lawsuits, costs and charges related to debt refinancing, and gain on insurance. Included item is the non-GAAP provision for current and deferred income taxes, calculated as the tax effect at 24.5%, 37%, and 35% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, effective tax rate of the pre-tax non-GAAP income before taxes. We believe that excluding and including such items help management and investors better understand our operating activities.\nExcluding the impact of settlement of lawsuits, impairment of assets, gain on patron tax settlement and gain on sale of assets, operating margin for the Nightclub segment would have been 35.1%, 33.1%, and 32.3% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Excluding the impact of impairment of assets, loss on sale of assets and settlement of claims, Bombshells segment operating margin would have been 15.1%, 16.4%, and 13.5% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Refer to discussion on Non-GAAP Measures on page 21.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nUnit-level manager payroll is included in salaries and wages for each location, while payroll for regional manager and above are included in general corporate.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nDebt Financing\n 28 \n 29 \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment of $3.5 million, of which $2.1 million was for indefinite-lived intangible assets of one club and $1.4 million was for one property held for sale. During the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $7.6 million ($1.4 million in the third quarter and $6.2 million in the fourth quarter) for the goodwill of four club locations ($4.7 million), including one that we have put up for sale during the fiscal year; for property and equipment of one club ($385,000); for SOB license of two club locations ($1.4 million), and for our remaining investment in Drink Robust ($1.2 million). During the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a loss on the note owed to us the by former owner of Drink Robust in relation to our reacquisition of Drink Robust ($1.55 million in the second quarter), impairment related to licenses of three clubs ($3.1 million in the fourth quarter), and impairment related to long-lived assets of a club that closed and a still-operating Bombshells ($1.6 million in the fourth quarter). See Notes 13 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n \u25cf Free cash flow* of $23.2 million compared to $19.3 million, a 20.5% increase \u25cf Revenues of $165.7 million compared to $144.9 million, a 14.4% increase (Nightclubs revenue of $140.1 million compared to $124.7 million, a 12.3% increase; and Bombshells revenue of $24.1 million compared to $18.8 million, a 28.0% increase) \u25cf Consolidated same-store sales increase of 4.6% (5.8% increase for Nightclubs and 3.3% decrease for Bombshells) \u25cf Diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $2.23 compared to $0.85, a 162.4% increase (non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $2.18 compared to $1.43, a 52.4% increase) \n</table>\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, we acquired two clubs, one in Florida (Scarlett's Miami) and another in Illinois (Hollywood Showclub) and certain adjacent real estate for an aggregate purchase price of $30.2 million. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions. We subsequently relaunched Hollywood Showclub as Scarlett's St. Louis.\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $802,000, or 11.6%, from 2017 to 2018 coming from newly acquired and constructed units. Depreciation and amortization decreased by $408,000, or 5.6%, from 2016 to 2017 mainly due to the cessation of depreciation on properties held for sale.\n* See definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow under Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets-our brands, financial strength, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and employees-to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareholders.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, additional limitations on the tax deductibility of interest, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. Our federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 24.5% percent and represents a blended income tax rate for the current fiscal year. For fiscal 2019, our federal corporate income tax rate will be 21%.\n \nOther than the debt refinancing and other notes payable financing described in Notes 7 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any event or trend that would potentially significantly affect liquidity. In the event such a trend develops, we believe our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be adequately met by cash flows from operations. In our opinion, working capital is not a true indicator of our financial status. Typically, businesses in our industry carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because businesses in our industry receive substantially immediate payment for sales, with nominal receivables, while inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. Vendors and purveyors often remain flexible with payment terms, providing businesses in our industry with opportunities to adjust to short-term business down turns. We consider the primary indicators of financial status to be the long-term trend of revenue growth, the mix of sales revenues, overall cash flow, profitability from operations, and the level of long-term debt.\n\nNightclubs segment revenues. Nightclubs revenues increased by 12.3% and 9.4% from 2017 to 2018 and from 2016 to 2017, respectively. A breakdown of the changes compared to total change in Nightclubs revenues is as follows:\n \nOn December 6, 2018, the Company amended the $5.0 million short-term note payable related to the Scarlett's acquisition, which had a remaining balance of $3.0 million as of December 6, 2018, extending the maturity date from May 8, 2019, as previously amended, to May 8, 2020. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \nAccounting and professional fees increased by $785,000, or 36.4%, from 2017 to 2018, and by $806,000, or 59.6%, from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to our hiring of an outside internal controls consultant in 2018 and the hiring of tax consultants to evaluate certain tax positions and our change of auditors in 2017 and 2018.\n\n 34 \nCost of goods sold includes cost of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, food, cigars and cigarettes, merchandise, media printing/binding and media. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated cost of goods sold was 13.8%, 14.3%, and 15.2% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See above for breakdown of percentages for each line item of consolidated cost of goods sold as it relates to the respective consolidated revenue line. For the Nightclubs segment, cost of goods sold was 11.8%, 12.7%, and 13.1% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which was primarily caused by the increase in higher-margin service revenue and sales of alcoholic beverages in the sales mix, which partly came from newly acquired clubs. Bombshells cost of goods sold of 24.6%, 24.8%, and 25.3% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was flatter and was not much of a contributor to the consolidated change in cost of goods sold rate.\n \nOur operating margin (income from operations divided by revenues) was 17.1% in 2018, 16.0% in 2017, and 15.3% in 2016. Nightclubs operating margin was 31.7%, 28.2%, and 29.1% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the closure of underperforming units, fixed expense leverage on increasing same-store sales, and impairment of assets of $3.6 million, $6.5 million, and $2.1 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Bombshells operating margin was 8.5%, 16.4%, and 6.2% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, mainly due to increasing sales partially offset by increasing depreciation expense from higher unit count and impairment of assets of $1.1 million in 2018.\nWe believe that Bombshells can grow organically and through careful entry into markets and demographic segments with high growth potential. All six of the currently existing Bombshells are located in Texas. Our growth strategy is to diversify our operations with these units which do not require SOB licenses, which are sometimes difficult to obtain. While we are searching for adult nightclubs to acquire, we are able to also search for restaurant/sports bar locations that are consistent with our income targets.\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from investing activities (in thousands):\nNet cash flows from operating activities increased from 2017 to 2018 mainly due to the increase in working capital from higher sales partially offset by higher income taxes and interest expense in 2018, while net cash flows from operating activities decreased from 2016 to 2017 due to a decrease in working capital caused by year-end vendor payments, higher income taxes and higher interest expense paid in 2017.\n \nAdvertising and marketing increased by $832,000, or 12.4%, from 2017 to 2018 mainly due to new units; and increased by $1.3 million, or 24.7%, from 2016 to 2017 mainly due to the acquisition of Scarlett's Miami in the third quarter of 2017 and the additional spending in relation to increase in revenues. As a percentage of revenues, advertising and marketing was 4.5%, 4.6%, and 4.0% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\n \n\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from financing activities (in thousands):\n 42 \nThe following tables present our non-GAAP performance measures for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\n 25 \n 24 \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. The near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in fiscal 2019. As a result of our expected cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. The Company has not recently raised capital through the issuance of equity securities. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on stockholders' equity. We have a history of borrowing funds in private transactions and from sellers in acquisition transactions and continue to have the ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates in that manner. We also have historically utilized these cash flows to invest in property and equipment, adult nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars.\n \n 38 \n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flows. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures.\nWe have not experienced a material overall impact from inflation in our operations during the past several years. To the extent permitted by competition, we have managed to recover increased costs through price increases and may continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAs mentioned in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and in a more detailed discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various suits and claims in the normal course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, the Company's consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n \nConsolidated salaries and wages increased by $4.5 million, or 11.3% from 2017 to 2018 and by $2.6 million, or 6.9%, from 2016 to 2017. The dollar increase from 2017 to 2018 was mainly from new club and restaurant openings. The dollar increase from 2016 to 2017 was mainly due to additional corporate headcount to support the commencement of our then-planned timing of franchising effort and a shift to employee status of certain entertainers in Phoenix (as discussed in the Business section above). As a percentage of revenues, consolidated salaries and wages has been decreasing at 26.9%, 27.6%, and 27.8% for fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decreasing rate primarily came from 2017 dollar increases coming mainly from corporate, where 2018 dollar increases coming mainly from new unit openings.\n\nBy reportable segment, selling, general and administrative expenses are broken down as follows (in thousands):\n \n 32 \n \nThe following table presents a summary of such indicators (dollars in thousands):\nWe plan to open four new Bombshells in fiscal 2019, one of which opened in December 2018.\nWe opened two new units in 2018 (one acquired club in Kappa, Illinois and one built Bombshells in Pearland, Texas); opened five new units in 2017 (including two acquired and one reconcepted from a Bombshells to a club); and reconcepted one club and acquired one club in 2016. We also constructed and moved to a new corporate office in 2016. As of September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had $6.4 million, $1.6 million, and $6.3 million in construction-in-progress related to clubs and Bombshells opening in the subsequent fiscal year.\nWe do not include total capital expenditures as a reduction from net cash flow from operating activities to arrive at free cash flow. This is because, based on our capital allocation strategy, acquisitions and development of our own clubs and restaurants are our primary uses of free cash flow.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nBelow is a table presenting the changes in each line item of the income statement for the last three fiscal years (dollar amounts in thousands)\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOVERVIEW\n 21 \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \nGROWTH STRATEGY\n Nightclubs Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and/or operate upscale adult nightclubs serving primarily businessmen and professionals. These nightclubs are in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Beaumont, Longview, Harlingen, Edinburg, Tye, Lubbock, El Paso and Odessa, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Miami Gardens and Pembroke Park, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington Park, Kappa and Chicago, Illinois. No sexual contact is permitted at any of our locations. We also own and operate Studio 80 dance clubs in Fort Worth and Webster, Texas. Bombshells Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and operate restaurants, and sports bars in Houston, Dallas, Austin, Spring and Pearland, Texas under the brand name Bombshells Restaurant & Bar. Media Group Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own a media division, including the leading trade magazine serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. We also own an industry trade show, an industry trade publication and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. \nAdjusted EBITDA. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by excluding the following items from net income attributable to RCIHH common shareholders: depreciation expense, amortization of intangibles, impairment of assets, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, interest income, gains or losses on sale of assets, settlement of lawsuits, gain on settlement of patron tax case, and gain on insurance. We believe that adjusting for such items helps management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal, state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions. The results are, therefore, without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed. We use adjusted EBITDA as one guideline to assess the unleveraged performance return on our investments. Adjusted EBITDA is also the target benchmark for our acquisitions of nightclubs.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of our additions to property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands):\n \nBombshells Webster was closed toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, while Bombshells 290 was opened early in the fourth quarter of 2017, and Bombshells Pearland was opened in the third quarter of 2018.\nIncluded in other revenues of the Nightclubs segment is real estate rental amounting to $1.2 million in 2018, $1.1 million in 2017, and $925,000 in 2016.\nWe believe that our nightclub operations can continue to grow organically and through careful entry into markets and demographic segments with high growth potential. Our growth strategy involves the following: (i) to acquire existing units in locations that are consistent with our growth and income targets and which appear receptive to the upscale club formula we have developed; (ii) to open new units after market analysis; (iii) to franchise our Bombshells brand; (iv) to form joint ventures or partnerships to reduce start-up and operating costs, with us contributing equity in the form of our brand name and management expertise; (v) to develop new club concepts that are consistent with our management and marketing skills; (vi) to develop and open our restaurant concepts as our capital and manpower allow; and (vii) to control the real estate in connection with club operations, although some units may be in leased premises.\nSEASONALITY\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands):\n\nDuring fiscal 2018, we reacquired Drink Robust (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements). Also in fiscal 2018, we acquired a club in Kappa, Illinois for $1.5 million, financed by a $1.0 million seller note with interest at 8%. The Kappa transaction provides for the purchase of the real estate for $825,000 and other non-real-estate business assets for $180,000, with goodwill amounting to $495,000. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions.\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from operating activities (in thousands):\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nConsolidated revenues increased by $20.9 million, or 14.4%, from 2017 to 2018, and increased by $10.0 million, or 7.4%, from 2016 to 2017. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to 11.5% in new (acquired or constructed) or reconcepted locations, the impact of the 4.6% increase in consolidated same-store sales, and a minimal increase in other revenues, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease from closed locations. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to a 7.4% increase in new (acquired or constructed) or reconcepted locations and the impact of the 4.9% increase in consolidated same-store sales, partially offset by a 3.8% decrease from closed locations and a minimal decrease from other revenue items.\n 36 \n\n \nOperating Expenses\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\n 30 \nWe also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion.\nInterest Expense\n\n \nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recognized a $2.0 million tax benefit representing the net amount to be realized from fiscal 2016 and from amending certain prior year federal tax returns to take available FICA tip tax credits, which were not taken in prior years.\nOn November 1, 2018, the Company raised $2.35 million through the issuance of 12% unsecured promissory notes to certain investors, which notes mature on November 1, 2021. The notes pay interest-only in equal monthly installments, with a lump sum principal payment at maturity. Among the promissory notes are two notes with a principal of $450,000 and $200,000. The $450,000 note was in exchange for a $300,000 12% note and the $200,000 note was in exchange for a $100,000 note, both of which were included in the May 1, 2017 financing discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Also included in the $2.35 million borrowing is a $500,000 note borrowed from a related party. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes were a benefit of $3.1 million in 2018, an expense of $6.4 million in 2017, and an expense of $2.4 million in 2016. Our effective income tax rate was a 16.7% benefit in 2018, and 43.4% and 18.5% expense in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The components of our annual effective income tax rate are the following:\nRent expense increased by $462,000, or 14.2% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to Scarlett's Miami, which was acquired in May 2017, and Bombshells 290, which was opened in July 2017. Decrease in rent expense from 2016 to 2017 was negligible. As a percentage of revenues, rent expense has been flat at 2.2% in 2018, 2.2% in 2017, and 2.4% in 2016.\nWe require capital principally for the acquisition of new clubs, construction of new Bombshells, renovation of older units, and investments in technology. We also utilize capital to repurchase our common stock as part of our share repurchase program based on our capital allocation strategy guidelines and to pay our quarterly dividends.\nBelow is a table which reflects segment contribution to income from operations (in thousands):\n 26 \nBombshells segment revenues. Bombshells revenues increased by 28.0% and 0.7% from 2017 to 2018 and from 2016 to 2017, respectively. A breakdown of the changes compared to total changes in Bombshells revenues is as follows:\nFor indefinite-lived intangibles, specifically SOB licenses, we determine fair value by estimating the multiperiod excess earnings of the asset with key assumptions being similar to those used in the goodwill impairment valuation model. For indefinite-lived tradename, we determine fair value by using the relief from royalty method. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We recorded impairment charges for SOB licenses amounting to $3.1 million in 2018 related to three clubs, $1.4 million in 2017 related to two clubs, and $2.1 million in 2016 related to one club.\nWe consider rent plus interest expense as our occupancy costs since most of our debts are for real property where our clubs and restaurants are located. For occupancy cost purposes, we exclude non-real-estate-related interest expense. As a percentage of revenues, total occupancy costs, with its components, are shown below.\nLong-Lived Assets\nCharge card fees increased by $461,000, or 16.6%, from 2017 to 2018, and by $531,000, or 23.6%, from 2016 to 2017. Both increases were mainly from higher revenues from prior year. As a percentage of revenues, charge card fees were 2.0%, 1.9%, and 1.7% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nA full discussion of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee.\nShare Repurchase\n \u25cf Our Business - a general description of our business and the adult nightclub industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business. \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. \u25cf Operations Review - an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of cash flows, aggregate contractual obligations, and an overview of financial position. \nSee Notes 7 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for detail regarding our long-term debt activity, including those subsequent to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\n 27 \nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. We calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin by excluding the following items from income from operations and operating margin: amortization of intangibles, gain on settlement of patron tax case, gains or losses on sale of assets, impairment of assets, stock-based compensation, settlement of lawsuits, and gain on insurance. We believe that excluding these items assists investors in evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating income and operating margin without the impact of items that are not a result of our day-to-day business and operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. This overview summarizes the MD&A, which includes the following sections:\n\n", "item_7_text": " \nHighlights from fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 include:\n\nRevenues\nThe components of consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses are in the tables below (dollars in thousands):\nWe purchased shares of our common stock representing 0 shares, 89,685 shares, and 747,081 shares in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. During the second quarter of 2016, we started paying quarterly dividends in the amount of $0.03 per share. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of our debt obligations and Note 19 related to the refinancing of several of our real estate notes payable.\nDuring fiscal 2016, we did not acquire any new club, restaurant or investment, in adherence to our capital allocation strategy. We acquired land for $5.9 million for future Bombshells sites. In September 2016, we opened Hoops Cabaret and Sports Bar in New York City.\n 31 \nIncome Taxes\nManagement's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make assumptions and estimates about future events and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates are based on management's historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. On a regular basis, we evaluate these accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results may differ from our estimates, and such differences could be material.\nThe following common size tables present a comparison of our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the past three fiscal years:\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n 41 \n \nIn October 2018, the Company sold its nightclub in Philadelphia for a total sales price of $1.0 million, payable $375,000 in cash at closing and a 9% note payable over a 10-year period. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the disposition.\nBy reportable segment, revenues were as follows (in thousands):\nWe have long-term contractual obligations primarily in the form of debt obligations and operating leases. The following table (in thousands) summarizes our contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as well as future minimum rent payments. Future interest payments related to debt were estimated using the interest rate in effect at September 30, 2018.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n* Per share amounts and percentages may not foot due to rounding.\n \nSubsequent to the end of fiscal 2018, we closed on the acquisition of one club in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and another club in Chicago, Illinois. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the acquisitions.\n 23 \nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Measure\n \nBy type of revenue line item, changes in Nightclubs segment revenues are broken down as:\nInvestment\nAs of September 30, 2018, we had a working capital of $55,000 (excluding the impact of assets held for sale amounting to $2.9 million) compared to negative working capital of $10.6 million as of September 30, 2017 (excluding the impact of assets held for sale amounting to $5.8 million). The increase in working capital is principally due to the following items:\nWe review long-lived assets, such as property and equipment, and intangible assets subject to amortization, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. These events or changes in circumstances include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining useful life of the primary asset included in the asset group. If the asset group is not recoverable, the impairment loss is calculated as the excess of the carrying value over the fair value. We define our asset group as an operating club or restaurant location, which is also our reporting unit or the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include management's estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins. If fair value is used to determine an impairment loss, an additional key assumption is the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. During the fourth quarter of 2018, we impaired one club and one Bombshells by a total of $1.6 million; during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we impaired one club by $385,000; and during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we impaired one property held for sale by $1.4 million.\nOur revenues are derived from the sale of liquor, beer, wine, food, merchandise; service revenues such as cover charges, membership fees, and facility use fees; and other revenues such as commissions from vending and ATM machines, real estate rental, valet parking, and other products and services for both nightclub and restaurant/sports bar operations. Media Group revenues include the sale of advertising content and revenues from our annual Expo convention. Our fiscal year-end is September 30.\nThe following are our operating segments:\nIncome from Operations\nInterest expense increased by $1.2 million from 2017 to 2018, and by $782,000 from 2016 to 2017. The increase in interest expense is due to higher average debt balance partially offset by lower weighted average interest rate.\nFor additional details regarding our Board approved share repurchase plans, please refer to Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\nLegal expenses increased by $512,000, or 16.7%, from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to increased legal activity. Decrease in legal expenses from 2016 to 2017 was negligible.\n\nOur impairment calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment in order to estimate fair values. If our actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to impairments that could be material. We do not believe that there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a change in the estimates or assumptions we used that could cause a material change in our calculated impairment charges.\nFor our goodwill impairment review, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. This assessment is based on several factors, including industry and market conditions, overall financial performance, including an assessment of cash flows in comparison to actual and projected results of prior periods. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value based on our qualitative analysis, or if we elect to skip this step, we perform a Step 1 quantitative analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. The fair value is determined using market-related valuation models, including earnings multiples, discounted cash flows, and comparable asset market values. Key estimates in the undiscounted cash flow model include management's estimate of the projected revenues and operating margins, along with the selection of a weighted-average cost of capital to discount cash flows. We recognize goodwill impairment in the amount that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, not to exceed the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit, based on the results of our Step 1 analysis. For the year ended September 30, 2017, we identified four reporting units that were impaired and recognized a goodwill impairment loss totaling $4.7 million. No goodwill impairment was recorded in fiscal 2018 and 2016.\n (a) We have $165,000 of uncertain tax positions recorded in accrued liabilities as of September 30, 2018. It is expected that these assessments will be settled within the next twelve months. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. (b) On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted into law (the Act\u201d). The Act provides, among others, the reduction of the statutory corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. \nBy reportable segment, salaries and wages are broken down as follows (in thousands):\n 33 \nBy type of revenue line item, changes in Bombshells segment revenues are broken down as:\nIncluded in the 2018 new units is Kappa Men's Club, which was acquired in May 2018. Included in 2017 new units are clubs acquired in the third quarter of 2017, Scarlett's Cabaret Miami and Hollywood Showclub (the latter now relaunched and rebranded as Scarlett's Cabaret St. Louis), which contributed a combined $5.6 million in 2017 revenues since the acquisition dates. The 2017-acquired clubs were still included in the 2018 new unit count until they completed one year of operations and were then qualified for inclusion in the same-store sales base.\n\nWe have not established financing other than the notes payable discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise.\n \nWe estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes. These estimates include depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes, allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on employee tip income, effective rates for state and local income taxes, and the deductibility of certain other items, among others. We adjust our annual effective income tax rate as additional information on outcomes or events becomes available.\n \nThe adjustments to reconcile net income attributable to RCIHH common shareholders to non-GAAP net income exclude the impact of adjustments related to noncontrolling interests, which is immaterial. In the calculation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, we take into consideration the adjustment to net income from assumed conversion of debentures (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\nDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we also fully impaired our remaining investment in Drink Robust amounting to $1.2 million. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value with the unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income.\n\nAs part of our capital allocation strategy, we buy back shares in the open market or through negotiated purchases, as authorized by our Board of Directors. During fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, we paid for treasury stock amounting to $0, $1.1 million, and $7.3 million representing 0 shares, 89,685 shares, and 747,081 shares, respectively. We have $3.1 million remaining to purchase additional shares as of September 30, 2018.\nInsurance increased by $1.5 million, or 36.6%, from 2017 to 2018, and increased by $431,000, or 12.1%, from 2016 to 2017. The increases in both years were primarily due to an increase in general liability insurance premiums and additional property insurance.\nOn December 22, 2017, during our first quarter 2018, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d) was enacted into law, which provides for significant changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, such as a reduction in the statutory federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% rate effective from January 1, 2018 forward and changes and limitations to certain tax deductions. The Company has a fiscal year end of September 30, so the change to the statutory corporate tax rate results in a blended federal statutory rate of 24.5% for its fiscal year 2018. The increase in state tax effective rate from 2017 to 2018 was mainly caused by the impact of return-to-provision true-up, which has an expense impact in 2018 while having a benefit in 2017.\n 22 \n\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, within the meaning of the SEC Regulation G, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor non-GAAP financial measures because it describes the operating performance of the Company and helps management and investors gauge our ability to generate cash flow, excluding (or including) some items that management believes are not representative of the ongoing business operations of the Company, but are included in (or excluded from) the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Relative to each of the non-GAAP financial measures, we further set forth our rationale as follows:\n \nThe components of other charges, net are in the table below (dollars in thousands):\nOUR BUSINESS\nTaxes and permits increased by $1.5 million, or 18.9%, from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to an increased operating activity and from several sales tax audit settlements.\nTotal operating expenses, as a percent of revenues, were 82.9%, 84.0%, and 84.7% for the fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Significant contributors to the change in operating expenses as a percent of revenues are explained below.\nItem 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d that follows. These measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures. </td> </tr>\n 39 \nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to acquire new nightclubs and anticipate acquiring new locations that fit our business model as we have done in the past. The acquisition of additional clubs may require us to take on additional debt or issue our common stock, or both. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on reasonable terms in the future, if at all, should the need arise. An inability to obtain such additional financing could have an adverse effect on our growth strategy.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, due to higher income before tax, our income tax rate has increased to 37%, of which has impacted the fourth quarter with the change in rate from 35% in the first nine months of the year and in prior years. A full year impact in the change in rate of our deferred tax liability has also been recognized in the fourth quarter. The change in deferred tax liability rate for 2017 is due to the 1% increase in our effective tax rate from the increase in the federal rate and also an increase in the states rate. This amount results from increasing by 2% the rate applied to our entire deferred tax liabilities at the beginning of the year. The reserve for uncertain tax positions results from an audit of the returns of one of the states in which we operate. As a result of the items discussed above which affected the fiscal year, the fourth quarter effective tax rate rose to 99.6% expense on a pre-tax loss.\n\n \u2020 Percentages may not foot due to rounding. Percentage of revenue for individual cost of goods sold items pertains to their respective revenue line. \nWe calculate same-store sales by comparing year-over-year revenues from nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars operating at least 12 full months. We exclude from a particular month's calculation units previously included in the same-store sales base that have closed temporarily for more than 15 days until its next full month of operations. We also exclude from the same-store sales base units that are being reconcepted or are closed due to renovations or remodels. Acquired units are included in the same-store sales calculation as long as they qualify based on the definition stated above. Revenues outside of our Nightclubs and Bombshells reportable segments are excluded from same-store sales calculation.\n \nDue to the seasonality of our businesses and the timing of the balloon payments on our long-term debt, we expect to have low cash levels during fiscal 2019, although we do not expect levels that would compromise our ability to service our debts and maintain normal operating activity. We believe that our current sources of liquidity and capital will be sufficient to finance our continued operations and growth plans not only within the next 12 months, but for the next 18 to 24 months. Refer to sections on Debt Financing and Contractual Obligations and Commitments below for a discussion of long-term liquidity and capital resources.\nOPERATIONS REVIEW\n\n * Reconciliation and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures are included under the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section of this Item. These measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures. \nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe significant variances in other charges, net are discussed below:\n 40 \nIncome Taxes\nThe significant variances in selling, general and administrative expenses are as follows:\n 37 \n\n\n\n 35 \nOther segment revenues. Other revenues included revenues from Drink Robust in 2018 and 2016, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2016. Drink Robust was later reacquired in March 2018 (see Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements. Drink Robust sales were $141,000, $0, and $1.0 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which excludes intercompany sales to Nightclubs and Bombshells units. Media business revenues were $1.4 million, $1.2 million, and $1.0 million in fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOur nightclub operations are affected by seasonal factors. Historically, we have experienced reduced revenues from April through September (our fiscal third and fourth quarters) with the strongest operating results occurring during October through March (our fiscal first and second quarters). Our revenues in certain markets are also affected by sporting events that cause unusual changes in sales from year to year.\nNon-GAAP Net Income and Non-GAAP Net Income per Diluted Share. We calculate non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share by excluding or including certain items to net income attributable to RCIHH common shareholders and diluted earnings per share. Excluded items are: amortization of intangibles, gain on settlement of patron tax case, income tax expense (benefit), impairment charges, gains or losses on sale of assets, stock-based compensation, settlement of lawsuits, costs and charges related to debt refinancing, and gain on insurance. Included item is the non-GAAP provision for current and deferred income taxes, calculated as the tax effect at 24.5%, 37%, and 35% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, effective tax rate of the pre-tax non-GAAP income before taxes. We believe that excluding and including such items help management and investors better understand our operating activities.\nExcluding the impact of settlement of lawsuits, impairment of assets, gain on patron tax settlement and gain on sale of assets, operating margin for the Nightclub segment would have been 35.1%, 33.1%, and 32.3% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Excluding the impact of impairment of assets, loss on sale of assets and settlement of claims, Bombshells segment operating margin would have been 15.1%, 16.4%, and 13.5% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Refer to discussion on Non-GAAP Measures on page 21.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nUnit-level manager payroll is included in salaries and wages for each location, while payroll for regional manager and above are included in general corporate.\nIMPACT OF INFLATION\nDebt Financing\n 28 \n 29 \n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded an impairment of $3.5 million, of which $2.1 million was for indefinite-lived intangible assets of one club and $1.4 million was for one property held for sale. During the year ended September 30, 2017, we recorded aggregate impairment charges of $7.6 million ($1.4 million in the third quarter and $6.2 million in the fourth quarter) for the goodwill of four club locations ($4.7 million), including one that we have put up for sale during the fiscal year; for property and equipment of one club ($385,000); for SOB license of two club locations ($1.4 million), and for our remaining investment in Drink Robust ($1.2 million). During the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a loss on the note owed to us the by former owner of Drink Robust in relation to our reacquisition of Drink Robust ($1.55 million in the second quarter), impairment related to licenses of three clubs ($3.1 million in the fourth quarter), and impairment related to long-lived assets of a club that closed and a still-operating Bombshells ($1.6 million in the fourth quarter). See Notes 13 and 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n \u25cf Free cash flow* of $23.2 million compared to $19.3 million, a 20.5% increase \u25cf Revenues of $165.7 million compared to $144.9 million, a 14.4% increase (Nightclubs revenue of $140.1 million compared to $124.7 million, a 12.3% increase; and Bombshells revenue of $24.1 million compared to $18.8 million, a 28.0% increase) \u25cf Consolidated same-store sales increase of 4.6% (5.8% increase for Nightclubs and 3.3% decrease for Bombshells) \u25cf Diluted earnings per share ( EPS\u201d) of $2.23 compared to $0.85, a 162.4% increase (non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $2.18 compared to $1.43, a 52.4% increase) \n</table>\n\nDuring fiscal 2017, we acquired two clubs, one in Florida (Scarlett's Miami) and another in Illinois (Hollywood Showclub) and certain adjacent real estate for an aggregate purchase price of $30.2 million. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions. We subsequently relaunched Hollywood Showclub as Scarlett's St. Louis.\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased by $802,000, or 11.6%, from 2017 to 2018 coming from newly acquired and constructed units. Depreciation and amortization decreased by $408,000, or 5.6%, from 2016 to 2017 mainly due to the cessation of depreciation on properties held for sale.\n* See definition and calculation of Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow under Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Liquidity and Capital Resources above.\nOur goal is to use our Company's assets-our brands, financial strength, and the talent and strong commitment of our management and employees-to become more competitive and to accelerate growth in a manner that creates value for our shareholders.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Act was signed into law. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, additional limitations on the tax deductibility of interest, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. Our federal corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 24.5% percent and represents a blended income tax rate for the current fiscal year. For fiscal 2019, our federal corporate income tax rate will be 21%.\n \nOther than the debt refinancing and other notes payable financing described in Notes 7 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, we are not aware of any event or trend that would potentially significantly affect liquidity. In the event such a trend develops, we believe our working capital and capital expenditure requirements will be adequately met by cash flows from operations. In our opinion, working capital is not a true indicator of our financial status. Typically, businesses in our industry carry current liabilities in excess of current assets because businesses in our industry receive substantially immediate payment for sales, with nominal receivables, while inventories and other current liabilities normally carry longer payment terms. Vendors and purveyors often remain flexible with payment terms, providing businesses in our industry with opportunities to adjust to short-term business down turns. We consider the primary indicators of financial status to be the long-term trend of revenue growth, the mix of sales revenues, overall cash flow, profitability from operations, and the level of long-term debt.\n\nNightclubs segment revenues. Nightclubs revenues increased by 12.3% and 9.4% from 2017 to 2018 and from 2016 to 2017, respectively. A breakdown of the changes compared to total change in Nightclubs revenues is as follows:\n \nOn December 6, 2018, the Company amended the $5.0 million short-term note payable related to the Scarlett's acquisition, which had a remaining balance of $3.0 million as of December 6, 2018, extending the maturity date from May 8, 2019, as previously amended, to May 8, 2020. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\n \nAccounting and professional fees increased by $785,000, or 36.4%, from 2017 to 2018, and by $806,000, or 59.6%, from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to our hiring of an outside internal controls consultant in 2018 and the hiring of tax consultants to evaluate certain tax positions and our change of auditors in 2017 and 2018.\n\n 34 \nCost of goods sold includes cost of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, food, cigars and cigarettes, merchandise, media printing/binding and media. As a percentage of consolidated revenues, consolidated cost of goods sold was 13.8%, 14.3%, and 15.2% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. See above for breakdown of percentages for each line item of consolidated cost of goods sold as it relates to the respective consolidated revenue line. For the Nightclubs segment, cost of goods sold was 11.8%, 12.7%, and 13.1% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, which was primarily caused by the increase in higher-margin service revenue and sales of alcoholic beverages in the sales mix, which partly came from newly acquired clubs. Bombshells cost of goods sold of 24.6%, 24.8%, and 25.3% for fiscal 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, was flatter and was not much of a contributor to the consolidated change in cost of goods sold rate.\n \nOur operating margin (income from operations divided by revenues) was 17.1% in 2018, 16.0% in 2017, and 15.3% in 2016. Nightclubs operating margin was 31.7%, 28.2%, and 29.1% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the closure of underperforming units, fixed expense leverage on increasing same-store sales, and impairment of assets of $3.6 million, $6.5 million, and $2.1 million for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Bombshells operating margin was 8.5%, 16.4%, and 6.2% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, mainly due to increasing sales partially offset by increasing depreciation expense from higher unit count and impairment of assets of $1.1 million in 2018.\nWe believe that Bombshells can grow organically and through careful entry into markets and demographic segments with high growth potential. All six of the currently existing Bombshells are located in Texas. Our growth strategy is to diversify our operations with these units which do not require SOB licenses, which are sometimes difficult to obtain. While we are searching for adult nightclubs to acquire, we are able to also search for restaurant/sports bar locations that are consistent with our income targets.\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from investing activities (in thousands):\nNet cash flows from operating activities increased from 2017 to 2018 mainly due to the increase in working capital from higher sales partially offset by higher income taxes and interest expense in 2018, while net cash flows from operating activities decreased from 2016 to 2017 due to a decrease in working capital caused by year-end vendor payments, higher income taxes and higher interest expense paid in 2017.\n \nAdvertising and marketing increased by $832,000, or 12.4%, from 2017 to 2018 mainly due to new units; and increased by $1.3 million, or 24.7%, from 2016 to 2017 mainly due to the acquisition of Scarlett's Miami in the third quarter of 2017 and the additional spending in relation to increase in revenues. As a percentage of revenues, advertising and marketing was 4.5%, 4.6%, and 4.0% for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\n \n\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from financing activities (in thousands):\n 42 \nThe following tables present our non-GAAP performance measures for the periods indicated (in thousands, except per share amounts and percentages):\n 25 \n 24 \nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe believe our ability to generate cash from operating activities is one of our fundamental financial strengths. The near-term outlook for our business remains strong, and we expect to generate substantial cash flows from operations in fiscal 2019. As a result of our expected cash flows from operations, we have significant flexibility to meet our financial commitments. The Company has not recently raised capital through the issuance of equity securities. Instead, we use debt financing to lower our overall cost of capital and increase our return on stockholders' equity. We have a history of borrowing funds in private transactions and from sellers in acquisition transactions and continue to have the ability to borrow funds at reasonable interest rates in that manner. We also have historically utilized these cash flows to invest in property and equipment, adult nightclubs and restaurants/sports bars.\n \n 38 \n\nManagement also uses certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flows. We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less maintenance capital expenditures.\nWe have not experienced a material overall impact from inflation in our operations during the past several years. To the extent permitted by competition, we have managed to recover increased costs through price increases and may continue to do so. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAs mentioned in Item 3 - Legal Proceedings\u201d and in a more detailed discussion in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, we are involved in various suits and claims in the normal course of business. We record a liability when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. There is significant judgment required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that we may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the outcome of legal proceedings and claims brought against the Company is subject to significant uncertainty. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management's expectations, the Company's consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected.\n \nConsolidated salaries and wages increased by $4.5 million, or 11.3% from 2017 to 2018 and by $2.6 million, or 6.9%, from 2016 to 2017. The dollar increase from 2017 to 2018 was mainly from new club and restaurant openings. The dollar increase from 2016 to 2017 was mainly due to additional corporate headcount to support the commencement of our then-planned timing of franchising effort and a shift to employee status of certain entertainers in Phoenix (as discussed in the Business section above). As a percentage of revenues, consolidated salaries and wages has been decreasing at 26.9%, 27.6%, and 27.8% for fiscal year 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. The decreasing rate primarily came from 2017 dollar increases coming mainly from corporate, where 2018 dollar increases coming mainly from new unit openings.\n\nBy reportable segment, selling, general and administrative expenses are broken down as follows (in thousands):\n \n 32 \n \nThe following table presents a summary of such indicators (dollars in thousands):\nWe plan to open four new Bombshells in fiscal 2019, one of which opened in December 2018.\nWe opened two new units in 2018 (one acquired club in Kappa, Illinois and one built Bombshells in Pearland, Texas); opened five new units in 2017 (including two acquired and one reconcepted from a Bombshells to a club); and reconcepted one club and acquired one club in 2016. We also constructed and moved to a new corporate office in 2016. As of September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had $6.4 million, $1.6 million, and $6.3 million in construction-in-progress related to clubs and Bombshells opening in the subsequent fiscal year.\nWe do not include total capital expenditures as a reduction from net cash flow from operating activities to arrive at free cash flow. This is because, based on our capital allocation strategy, acquisitions and development of our own clubs and restaurants are our primary uses of free cash flow.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nBelow is a table presenting the changes in each line item of the income statement for the last three fiscal years (dollar amounts in thousands)\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOVERVIEW\n 21 \nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n \nGROWTH STRATEGY\n Nightclubs Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and/or operate upscale adult nightclubs serving primarily businessmen and professionals. These nightclubs are in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, Fort Worth, Beaumont, Longview, Harlingen, Edinburg, Tye, Lubbock, El Paso and Odessa, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; New York, New York; Miami Gardens and Pembroke Park, Florida; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, Arizona; and Washington Park, Kappa and Chicago, Illinois. No sexual contact is permitted at any of our locations. We also own and operate Studio 80 dance clubs in Fort Worth and Webster, Texas. Bombshells Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own and operate restaurants, and sports bars in Houston, Dallas, Austin, Spring and Pearland, Texas under the brand name Bombshells Restaurant & Bar. Media Group Our wholly-owned subsidiaries own a media division, including the leading trade magazine serving the multibillion-dollar adult nightclubs industry and the adult retail products industry. We also own an industry trade show, an industry trade publication and more than a dozen industry and social media websites. \nAdjusted EBITDA. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by excluding the following items from net income attributable to RCIHH common shareholders: depreciation expense, amortization of intangibles, impairment of assets, income tax expense (benefit), interest expense, interest income, gains or losses on sale of assets, settlement of lawsuits, gain on settlement of patron tax case, and gain on insurance. We believe that adjusting for such items helps management and investors better understand our operating activities. Adjusted EBITDA provides a core operational performance measurement that compares results without the need to adjust for federal, state and local taxes which have considerable variation between domestic jurisdictions. The results are, therefore, without consideration of financing alternatives of capital employed. We use adjusted EBITDA as one guideline to assess the unleveraged performance return on our investments. Adjusted EBITDA is also the target benchmark for our acquisitions of nightclubs.\nFollowing is a reconciliation of our additions to property and equipment for the years ended September 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016 (in thousands):\n \nBombshells Webster was closed toward the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, while Bombshells 290 was opened early in the fourth quarter of 2017, and Bombshells Pearland was opened in the third quarter of 2018.\nIncluded in other revenues of the Nightclubs segment is real estate rental amounting to $1.2 million in 2018, $1.1 million in 2017, and $925,000 in 2016.\nWe believe that our nightclub operations can continue to grow organically and through careful entry into markets and demographic segments with high growth potential. Our growth strategy involves the following: (i) to acquire existing units in locations that are consistent with our growth and income targets and which appear receptive to the upscale club formula we have developed; (ii) to open new units after market analysis; (iii) to franchise our Bombshells brand; (iv) to form joint ventures or partnerships to reduce start-up and operating costs, with us contributing equity in the form of our brand name and management expertise; (v) to develop new club concepts that are consistent with our management and marketing skills; (vi) to develop and open our restaurant concepts as our capital and manpower allow; and (vii) to control the real estate in connection with club operations, although some units may be in leased premises.\nSEASONALITY\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities (in thousands):\n\nDuring fiscal 2018, we reacquired Drink Robust (see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements). Also in fiscal 2018, we acquired a club in Kappa, Illinois for $1.5 million, financed by a $1.0 million seller note with interest at 8%. The Kappa transaction provides for the purchase of the real estate for $825,000 and other non-real-estate business assets for $180,000, with goodwill amounting to $495,000. See Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for details of the transactions.\nFollowing are our summarized cash flows from operating activities (in thousands):\n\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nConsolidated revenues increased by $20.9 million, or 14.4%, from 2017 to 2018, and increased by $10.0 million, or 7.4%, from 2016 to 2017. The increase from 2017 to 2018 was primarily due to 11.5% in new (acquired or constructed) or reconcepted locations, the impact of the 4.6% increase in consolidated same-store sales, and a minimal increase in other revenues, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease from closed locations. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to a 7.4% increase in new (acquired or constructed) or reconcepted locations and the impact of the 4.9% increase in consolidated same-store sales, partially offset by a 3.8% decrease from closed locations and a minimal decrease from other revenue items.\n 36 \n\n \nOperating Expenses\nGoodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are tested annually for impairment during our fourth fiscal quarter, and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\n 30 \nWe also use certain non-GAAP cash flow measures such as free cash flow. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section for further discussion.\nInterest Expense\n\n \nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recognized a $2.0 million tax benefit representing the net amount to be realized from fiscal 2016 and from amending certain prior year federal tax returns to take available FICA tip tax credits, which were not taken in prior years.\nOn November 1, 2018, the Company raised $2.35 million through the issuance of 12% unsecured promissory notes to certain investors, which notes mature on November 1, 2021. The notes pay interest-only in equal monthly installments, with a lump sum principal payment at maturity. Among the promissory notes are two notes with a principal of $450,000 and $200,000. The $450,000 note was in exchange for a $300,000 12% note and the $200,000 note was in exchange for a $100,000 note, both of which were included in the May 1, 2017 financing discussed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. Also included in the $2.35 million borrowing is a $500,000 note borrowed from a related party. See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIncome taxes were a benefit of $3.1 million in 2018, an expense of $6.4 million in 2017, and an expense of $2.4 million in 2016. Our effective income tax rate was a 16.7% benefit in 2018, and 43.4% and 18.5% expense in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The components of our annual effective income tax rate are the following:\nRent expense increased by $462,000, or 14.2% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to Scarlett's Miami, which was acquired in May 2017, and Bombshells 290, which was opened in July 2017. Decrease in rent expense from 2016 to 2017 was negligible. As a percentage of revenues, rent expense has been flat at 2.2% in 2018, 2.2% in 2017, and 2.4% in 2016.\nWe require capital principally for the acquisition of new clubs, construction of new Bombshells, renovation of older units, and investments in technology. We also utilize capital to repurchase our common stock as part of our share repurchase program based on our capital allocation strategy guidelines and to pay our quarterly dividends.\nBelow is a table which reflects segment contribution to income from operations (in thousands):\n 26 \nBombshells segment revenues. Bombshells revenues increased by 28.0% and 0.7% from 2017 to 2018 and from 2016 to 2017, respectively. A breakdown of the changes compared to total changes in Bombshells revenues is as follows:\nFor indefinite-lived intangibles, specifically SOB licenses, we determine fair value by estimating the multiperiod excess earnings of the asset with key assumptions being similar to those used in the goodwill impairment valuation model. For indefinite-lived tradename, we determine fair value by using the relief from royalty method. The fair value is then compared to the carrying value and an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset. We recorded impairment charges for SOB licenses amounting to $3.1 million in 2018 related to three clubs, $1.4 million in 2017 related to two clubs, and $2.1 million in 2016 related to one club.\nWe consider rent plus interest expense as our occupancy costs since most of our debts are for real property where our clubs and restaurants are located. For occupancy cost purposes, we exclude non-real-estate-related interest expense. As a percentage of revenues, total occupancy costs, with its components, are shown below.\nLong-Lived Assets\nCharge card fees increased by $461,000, or 16.6%, from 2017 to 2018, and by $531,000, or 23.6%, from 2016 to 2017. Both increases were mainly from higher revenues from prior year. As a percentage of revenues, charge card fees were 2.0%, 1.9%, and 1.7% in 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nA full discussion of our significant accounting policies is contained in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, which is included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial results. These estimates require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments because they relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with our Audit Committee.\nShare Repurchase\n \u25cf Our Business - a general description of our business and the adult nightclub industry, our objective, our strategic priorities, our core capabilities, and challenges and risks of our business. \u25cf Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates. \u25cf Operations Review - an analysis of our Company's consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements. \u25cf Liquidity and Capital Resources - an analysis of cash flows, aggregate contractual obligations, and an overview of financial position. \nSee Notes 7 and 19 to our consolidated financial statements for detail regarding our long-term debt activity, including those subsequent to the fiscal year ended September 30, 2018.\n 27 \nNon-GAAP Operating Income and Non-GAAP Operating Margin. We calculate non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating margin by excluding the following items from income from operations and operating margin: amortization of intangibles, gain on settlement of patron tax case, gains or losses on sale of assets, impairment of assets, stock-based compensation, settlement of lawsuits, and gain on insurance. We believe that excluding these items assists investors in evaluating period-over-period changes in our operating income and operating margin without the impact of items that are not a result of our day-to-day business and operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is intended to help the reader understand RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., our operations and our present business environment. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this report.

Its business segments are Nightclubs, Bombshells, and Media Group.\n\n- Revenue increased 14.4% in 2018 vs 2017, driven by new club and restaurant openings, same-store sales growth, and minimal growth in other revenues. \n\n- Net income increased significantly in 2018 vs 2017 mainly due to a large tax benefit from the change in federal tax law. Excluding this, non-GAAP net income increased 52.4%.\n\n- The company uses several non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance such as Adjusted EBITDA, non-GAAP net income, free cash flow, etc. These exclude certain non-operational items.\n\n- The nightclub segment saw revenue growth from new club openings and same-store sales growth. Operating margin improved due to fixed cost leverage.\n\n- The Bombshells segment had strong revenue growth from new locations. Operating margin decreased due to higher depreciation. \n\n- Cash from operations increased due to higher sales. Cash from investing decreased due to higher spending on new locations. Cash from financing included debt refinancing activities.\n\n- The company has a seasonal business with higher revenues in the winter months.
