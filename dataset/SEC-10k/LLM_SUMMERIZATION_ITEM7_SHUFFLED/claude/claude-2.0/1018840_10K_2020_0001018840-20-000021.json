The Company offers a broad assortment of apparel, personal care products and accessories for men, women and kids under the Hollister, Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. The brands share a commitment to offering unique products of enduring quality and exceptional comfort that allow customers around the world to express their own individuality and style. The Company primarily has operations in North America, Europe and Asia, among other regions.\nThe Company's two operating segments are brand-based: Hollister and Abercrombie, the latter of which includes the Company's Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. All references herein to the Company's fiscal years are as follows:\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of weeks\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 2, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 1, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fiscal 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>January 30, 2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDue to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year and we could have significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts. The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the fall season, the third and fourth fiscal quarters, due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods, respectively.\nKey performance indicators\nThe following measurements are among the key performance indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Company's results:\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Change in net sales and comparable sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Comparative results of operations on a constant currency basis with the prior year's results converted at the current year's foreign currency exchange rate to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross profit and gross profit rate;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales ( operating income margin\u201d);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Net income and net income attributable to A&F;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Inventory per gross square foot and inventory to net sales ratio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Cash flow and liquidity measures, such as the Company's current ratio, working capital and free cash flow;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Store metrics such as net sales per gross square foot, and store 4-wall operating margins;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Digital and omnichannel metrics, such as total shipping expense as a percentage of digital sales, and certain metrics related to our Purchase-Online-Pickup-in-Store and Order-in-Store programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Transactional metrics such as traffic and conversion, performance across key product categories, average unit retail, average unit cost, average units per transaction and average transaction values;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Return on invested capital and return on equity; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Customer-centric metrics such as customer satisfaction, brand health scores and certain metrics related to the loyalty programs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWhile not all of these metrics are disclosed publicly by the Company due to the proprietary nature of the information, the Company publicly discloses and discusses many of these metrics within this MD&A.\nCURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK\nCOVID-19\nAs a result of COVID 19, in January 2020, we began to experience business disruptions in the Asia-Pacific region, including the temporary closure of stores in China and the surrounding area, modified operating hours in certain stores that remained open, and a decline in traffic. In late February 2020, the situation escalated as the scope of COVID-19 worsened beyond the Asia-Pacific region, with Europe and the United States experiencing significant outbreaks. In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to COVID-19, certain governments have imposed travel restrictions and local statutory quarantines. We are monitoring and reacting to the COVID-19 situation on a daily basis, including by conforming to local government and global health organizations' guidance; implementing global travel restrictions; and recommending associates who are able to perform their role remotely to do so.\nWith the wellbeing of our customers, associates and business partners in mind, we temporarily closed our Company-operated stores across brands in North America and Europe, effective March 15, 2020 and March 16, 2020, respectively, and expect these stores to remain closed until further notice. The majority of our stores in the Asia-Pacific region have reopened, although many with temporarily reduced operating hours. We plan to follow the guidance of local governments and health organizations to determine when we can reopen these stores and to evaluate whether further store closures in the Asia-Pacific region will be necessary. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings, which may occur on a location-by-location basis.\nOur robust digital operations across brands remain open to serve our customers during this unprecedented period of temporary store closures.\nWe are also monitoring the impacts COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, on our global supply chain, including potential disruptions of product deliveries. We source the majority of our merchandise outside of the U.S. through arrangements with vendors primarily located in southeast Asia. In order to complete production, these vendors' manufacturing factories are dependent on raw materials from fabric mills that are primarily located in the Asia-Pacific region. We are collaborating with our third-party partners to mitigate significant delays in delivery of merchandise, as certain factories have been closed, and certain other factories are operating at a limited capacity.\nWe entered this period of uncertainty with a healthy liquidity position and are taking immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance our ability to meet the business' short-term liquidity needs, in order to best position the business for our key stakeholders, including our associates, customers and shareholders. As a precautionary measure, in March 2020, we borrowed $210 million under the asset-based revolving credit facility to improve our cash position and withdrew the majority of excess funds from the overfunded Rabbi Trust assets, which provided us with $50 million of additional cash. We continue to partner with our vendors, landlords, and lenders to preserve liquidity and mitigate risk during this unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, we are actively monitoring and assessing the rapidly emerging government policy and economic stimulus responses to COVID-19.\nWe have seen, and expect to continue to see material reductions in sales across brands and regions as a result of COVID-19. In addition, these reductions in revenue have not been offset by proportional decreases in expense, as we continue to incur store occupancy costs such as operating lease costs and depreciation expense, and certain other costs such as compensation and administrative expenses, resulting in a negative effect on the relationship between our costs and revenues.\nIn addition, we could experience other material impacts as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, charges from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of inventory, asset impairment charges, deferred tax valuation allowances and changes in the effectiveness of our hedging instruments.\nThe current circumstances are dynamic and the impacts of COVID-19 on our business operations, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, although we anticipate COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in Fiscal 2020.\nIt is possible that our preparations for the events listed above are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect our business and results of operations. For discussion of significant risks that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLong-term growth plans\nAs the COVID-19 situation allows, we continue to evaluate opportunities to make progress on initiatives that position the business for sustainable long-term growth that align with our strategic pillars on a market-by-market basis. We remain committed to putting our customers at the center of everything that we do and meeting our customers' needs whenever, wherever and however they choose to shop. We aim to anticipate our customers' needs through a test-and-learn mentality, which we have worked to embed throughout our organization. Our plans for long-term growth are best categorized into three planned phases:\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Phase I: Stabilizing while Transforming\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2015 through Fiscal 2017\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Phase II: Growing while Transforming\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Phase III: Accelerating Growth\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring Phase I, Stabilizing while Transforming,\u201d we transformed the organization by centering it around the customer, which included developing playbooks with the customer in mind, that align product, brand voice and experience. Transforming the organization included implementing a new brand-centric organizational structure, with branded core customer-facing functions. This built the foundation for the growth experienced across brands, channels and geographies in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017. As our brands gained momentum, we ended this phase with a strong balance sheet, reduced fixed costs and improved real estate productivity.\nWe are currently in Phase II, Growing while Transforming.\u201d We remain committed to our long-term vision and continue to position ourselves to make progress against our key transformation initiatives while balancing the near-term challenges and unprecedented uncertainty presented by COVID-19. Our key transformation initiatives are as follows:\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Optimizing our global store network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Enhancing digital and omnichannel capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Increasing the speed and efficiency of our concept-to-customer product life cycle by further investing in capabilities to position our supply chain for greater speed, agility and efficiency, while leveraging data and analytics to offer the right product at the right time and the right price; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Improving our customer engagement through our loyalty programs and marketing optimization.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOver Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019, the first two years of Phase II, Growing while Transforming,\u201d we have made significant progress against our transformation initiatives as we:\nTable 128: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Delivered 157 new store experiences through new stores, remodels and right-sizes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reduced store gross square footage by 6% and closed four large footprint, underperforming flagship stores;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Implemented omnichannel capabilities, including Purchase Online Pick Up in Store and in Order in Store;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Equipped our associates with handheld devices to improve shopping and checkout;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Reduced our product development calendar by multiple weeks;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Lowered our reliance on China manufacturing with 22% of our merchandise receipts in Fiscal 2019 sourced from China, down from 42% in Fiscal 2017, based on dollar cost;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Introduced local customer and product-facing teams in our new London and Shanghai regional headquarters; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Evolved our loyalty programs, Club Cali and myAbercrombie, and rolled these programs out in China.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe ended Fiscal 2019 on a strong note, and recorded our third consecutive full year of sales growth, despite the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million. In Fiscal 2019, Abercrombie outperformed Hollister and the United States outperformed international. In the near-term, we are focused on navigating the recent challenges presented by COVID-19, as discussed above. We believe there is too much uncertainty to provide an estimated impact of COVID-19 at this time or a full year outlook for Fiscal 2020. Refer to COVID-19,\u201d provided within this CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK,\u201d section for further discussion.\nWe remain committed to our long-term vision. Upon completion of Phase II, Growing while Transforming\u201d we will move to Phase III, Accelerating Growth.\u201d In Phase III we will aim to take market share in the U.S. and grow our business globally while continuing to focus on our long-term profitability target of doubling Fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP operating income margin of 2.9% through top-line growth, gross profit rate expansion and operating expense leverage.\nWe are a global multi-brand omnichannel specialty retailer, with operations in North America, Europe and Asia, among other regions and, as a result, we are mindful of macroeconomic risks and global challenges that could adversely impact certain areas of our business. As a result, in addition to the events listed below, we continue to monitor certain other global events. Our team continues to assess the potential impacts these events and similar events may have on the business in future periods and continues to develop contingency plans to assist in mitigating potential impacts. It is possible that our preparations for the events listed below are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect our business and results of operations. For discussion of significant risks that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGlobal Store Network Optimization\nReflecting a continued focus on our key transformation initiative \u2018Global Store Network Optimization,' we delivered new store experiences across brands during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019. Details related to our new store experiences follow:\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of new store experience\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>New stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remodels\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Right-sizes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA component of optimizing our global store network is pivoting away from large format flagship stores as we strive to open smaller, more productive omnichannel focused brand experiences. As a result, we have closed certain of our flagship stores and may have additional closures as we execute against this strategy. Although some of these closures may be completed through natural lease expirations, certain other of our leases include early termination options that can be exercised under specific conditions. We may also elect to exit or modify our other leases, and could incur charges related to these actions.\nFor context, at the beginning of Fiscal 2019, we had 19 flagship stores, and at end of Fiscal 2019, we had 15 flagship stores.

These tariffs are not expected to have a significant year-over-year impact on cost of merchandise and gross profit in Fiscal 2020.\nWe continue to focus on the diversification of our global supply chain. Our team had taken actions to proactively prepare for the impacts of these tariffs, including shifting production into other countries and regions to both existing and new partners as necessary. Only a portion of our total goods sourced from China are imported into the U.S. and are subject to these additional tariffs. For context, approximately 15% and 25% of total merchandise receipts were sourced from China and imported to the U.S. in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, and we expect to reduce this percentage in Fiscal 2020.\nUnited Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d)\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom passed a referendum to recommend withdrawing from the European Union. Although the United Kingdom left the European Union in January 2020, the final terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal remain unclear. As a result, there is continued uncertainty related to consumer behavior, trade relations, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rates and the free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the United Kingdom and the European Union during this time of transition.\nWe believe that this referendum and the uncertainty surrounding the terms of United Kingdom's withdrawal throughout the year adversely impacted international sales results in Fiscal 2019. We experienced decreased traffic in the United Kingdom and declining values of the Euro and British Pound as compared to the U.S. Dollar over the last year. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could also adversely impact other areas of our business, including, but not limited to, an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of merchandise from our Netherlands distribution center to our customers in the United Kingdom if trade barriers materialize. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could also adversely impact the operations of our vendors and of our other third-party partners.\nIn order to mitigate the risks associated with the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, our team is: collaborating across the organization and testing our systems; working with external partners to develop contingency plans for potential adverse impacts; and taking actions to reduce, to the extent possible, the potential impact of any incremental duty exposure.\nSummary of results\nA summary of results for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 follows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>GAAP\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except change in net sales, comparable sales, gross profit rate, operating income margin and per share amounts)\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,623,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,590,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in net sales\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparable sales (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit rate (3)\n</td> <td>59.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin (4)\n</td> <td>1.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to A&F (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,541\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79,789\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per diluted share attributable to A&F (4)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Refer to RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d for details on excluded items.

The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the fall season, the third and fourth fiscal quarters, due to back-to-school and holiday sales periods, respectively. The Company relies on excess operating cash flows, which are largely generated in Fall, to fund operations throughout the year and to reinvest in the business to support future growth. The Company also has an asset-based revolving credit facility available as a source of additional funding.\nCredit facilities\nOn August 7, 2014, the Company, through its subsidiary Abercrombie & Fitch Management Co. ( A&F Management\u201d) as the lead borrower (with A&F and certain other subsidiaries as borrowers or guarantors), entered into an asset-based revolving credit agreement.\nOn October 19, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiary A&F Management, entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the ABL Second Amendment\u201d), amending and extending the maturity date of the asset-based revolving credit agreement to October 19, 2022. As amended, the asset-based revolving credit agreement continues to provide for a senior secured credit facility of up to $400 million (the Amended ABL Facility\u201d).\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company had not drawn on the Amended ABL Facility, but had availability under the Amended ABL facility of $272.0 million, net of $0.8 million in outstanding stand-by letters of credit. As the Company must maintain excess availability equal to the greater of 10% of the loan cap or $30 million under the Amended ABL Facility, actual incremental borrowing available to the Company and under the Amended ABL Facility was $242.0 million as of February 1, 2020. As a precautionary measure in response to COVID-19, in March 2020, the Company borrowed $210 million under the Amended ABL Facility to improve its cash position. Refer to Note 22, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS,\u201d for further discussion.\nOn August 7, 2014, the Company, through its subsidiary A&F Management as the borrower (with A&F and certain other subsidiaries as guarantors), entered into a term loan agreement, which provides for a term loan facility of $300 million (the Term Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the Amended ABL Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d). The Term Loan Facility will mature on August 7, 2021.\nOn June 22, 2018, the Company, through its subsidiary A&F Management, entered into a Second Amendment to Term Loan Credit Agreement, which, among other things, repriced the Term Loan Facility by reducing the applicable margins for term loans by 0.25%.\nThe Credit Facilities are further described in Note 12, BORROWINGS.\u201d\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing activities\nThe table below provides certain components of the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018:\nTable 190: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and equivalents, and restricted cash and equivalents, beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>697,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>300,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>352,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for investing activities\n</td> <td>(202,784\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(152,393\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used for financing activities\n</td> <td>(147,873\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(131,691\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>(3,593\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,975\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net decrease in cash and equivalents, and restricted cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>(53,565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,874\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and equivalents, and restricted cash and equivalents, end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>692,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>745,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities - For both Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the primary source of cash from operations was from the sale of merchandise, largely generated in the Fall season. The year-over-year decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018 reflects: a lower net income in the current year as compared to the prior year; changes in the timing of payments to vendors, including increased payments in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year; partially offset by decreased incentive compensation payments in Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year and changes in inventories.\nInvesting activities - For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, net cash outflows for investing activities were used for purchases of property and equipment.\nFinancing activities - For Fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of the repurchase of approximately 4.0 million shares of A&F's Common Stock in the open market with a market value of approximately $63.5 million, dividend payments of $51.5 million and voluntary debt repayments of $20.0 million. For Fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of approximately 2.9 million shares of A&F's Common Stock in the open market with a market value of approximately $68.7 million and dividend payments of $53.7 million.\nFuture cash requirements and sources of cash\nThe Company's capital allocation strategy, priorities and investments are reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors considering both liquidity and valuation factors, including the potential severity of impacts to the business resulting from COVID-19.\nPrimary sources of cash\nThe Company's primary source of cash to execute against its capital allocation strategy is its operating cash flows, largely generated in the Fall season, used to fund operations throughout the fiscal year and to reinvest in the business to support future growth. The Company entered this period of uncertainty with a healthy liquidity position and is taking immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance the Company's ability to meet the business' short-term liquidity needs, in order to best position the business for its key stakeholders, including the Company's associates, customers and shareholders. As a precautionary measure, in March 2020, the Company borrowed $210 million under its asset-based revolving credit facility to improve the Company's cash position and withdrew the majority of excess funds from its overfunded Rabbi Trust assets, which provided the Company with $50 million of additional cash. The Company believes that it will have adequate liquidity to fund operating activities over the next 12 months.\nPrimary uses of cash\nThe Company's current capital allocation strategy is to prioritize navigating the near-term challenges that COVID-19 presents and continuing to fund operating activities. In response to COVID-19, the Company is taking immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance the Company's ability to meet the business' short-term liquidity needs. As a result, over the next twelve months, the Company's expects its primary cash requirements to be towards funding operating activities, including the acquisition of inventory, and obligations related to compensation, leases and any lease buyouts or modifications it may exercise, taxes and other operating activities.\nThe Company also evaluates opportunities for investments in line with our key transformation initiatives that position the business for sustainable long-term growth and strives to invest in projects that have high expected returns. These improvements may include new store experiences or investments in its omnichannel initiatives or loyalty programs. In addition, the Company evaluates store closures, including flagship lease buyouts and options to early terminate store leases. Historically, the Company has utilized free cash flow generated from operations to fund any discretionary capital expenditures, which have been prioritized towards new store experiences, as well as digital and omnichannel investments, information technology, and other projects.\nAt times, the Company may utilize excess liquidity, towards debt service requirements, including voluntary debt prepayments, or required repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, as defined in the term loan credit agreement applicable to the Term Loan Facility.\nShare repurchases and dividends\nIn response to COVID-19, in line with the Company's cash preservation strategy, the Company continues to assess its plans for share repurchases and dividends. Historically, the Company has returned cash to stockholders through dividends and completes share repurchases as deemed appropriate by utilizing free cash flow generated from operations or proceeds from the Amended ABL Facility.\nDividends are declared at the discretion of A&F's Board of Directors. A quarterly dividend, of $0.20 per share outstanding, was declared in each of February, May, August and November in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. Dividends were paid in each of March, June, September and December in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. A&F's Board of Directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis and establishes the dividend amount based on A&F's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects and other factors, including the potential severity of impacts to the business resulting from COVID-19 and any restrictions related to the Company's Credit Facilities. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nIn response to COVID-19, in March 2020, the Company announced that it does not plan to repurchase any shares of its Common Stock for the foreseeable future. The Company may repurchase shares of its Common Stock from time to time, dependent on market and business conditions, with the primary objective to offset dilution from issuances of Common Stock associated with the exercise of employee stock appreciation rights and the vesting of restricted stock units.

The Company has determined that the balance of the Company's undistributed earnings and profits from its foreign subsidiaries as of February 2, 2019 are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and if these funds were to be repatriated to the U.S., the Company would expect to incur an insignificant amount of state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The Company accrues for both state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes with respect to earnings and profits earned after February 2, 2019, in such a manner that these funds could be repatriated without incurring additional taxes.\nAs of February 1, 2020, $311.6 million of the Company's $671.3 million of cash and equivalents was held by foreign affiliates. The Company is not dependent on dividends from its foreign affiliates to fund its U.S. operations or pay dividends to A&F's stockholders.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law and, in May 2019, Switzerland voted to approve the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Company believes the following policies are the most critical to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nTable 196: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue Recognition\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Company maintains loyalty programs, which primarily provide customers with the opportunity to earn points toward future merchandise discount rewards with qualifying purchases. The Company accounts for expected future merchandise discount reward redemptions by recognizing an unearned revenue liability as customers accumulate points, taking into account expected future redemptions, which remains until revenue is recognized at the earlier of redemption or expiration, as a component of net sales.\nThis assessment requires management to make assumptions and judgments related to the probability that accumulated points will be converted into merchandise discount rewards, the probability that merchandise discount rewards will be redeemed by customers and the pattern of redemption activity. The Company determines its estimates of these factors based on historical redemption patterns.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The Company does not expect material changes to the underlying assumptions used to estimate deferred revenue associated with loyalty programs as of February 1, 2020. However, actual results could vary from estimates and could result in material gains or losses.\nAn increase or decrease of 10% in the Company's point expiration and reward redemption estimates as of February 1, 2020 would have affected pre-tax income by approximately $4.0 million for Fiscal 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory Valuation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Company reviews inventories on a quarterly basis. The Company reduces the inventory valuation when the carrying cost of specific inventory items on hand exceeds the amount expected to be realized from the ultimate sale or disposal of the goods, through a lower of cost and net realizable value ( LCNRV\u201d) adjustment.\nThe LCNRV adjustment reduces inventory to its net realizable value based on the Company's consideration of multiple factors and assumptions, including demand forecasts, current sales volumes, expected sell-off activity, composition and aging of inventory, historical recoverability experience and risk of obsolescence from changes in economic conditions or customer preferences.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The Company does not expect material changes to the underlying assumptions used to measure the LCNRV estimate as of February 1, 2020. However, actual results could vary from estimates and could significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost, as well as gross profit.\nAn increase or decrease in the LCNRV adjustment of 10% would have affected pre-tax income by approximately $1.5 million for Fiscal 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. Tax laws often require items to be included in tax filings at different times than the items are being reflected in the financial statements. A current liability is recognized for the estimated taxes payable for the current year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid. Deferred taxes are adjusted for enacted changes in tax rates and tax laws. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The Company does not expect material changes in the judgments, assumptions or interpretations used to calculate the tax provision for Fiscal 2020. However, changes in these judgments, assumptions or interpretations may occur and should those changes be significant, they could have a material impact on the Company's income tax provision. As of the end of Fiscal 2019, the Company had recorded valuation allowances of $8.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legal Contingencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Company is a defendant in lawsuits and other adversarial proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. Legal costs incurred in connection with the resolution of claims and lawsuits are expensed as incurred, and the Company establishes estimated liabilities for the outcome of litigation where it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss, or range of loss, is reasonably estimable. For probable losses, the Company accrues to the low end of an estimated range of loss, unless another amount within the range is determined to be more likely. Significant judgment may be applied in assessing the probability of loss and in estimating the amount of such loss.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Actual liabilities may differ from the amounts recorded, and there can be no assurance that the final resolution of legal contingencies will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Policy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-lived Assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-lived assets, primarily operating lease right-of-use assets, leasehold improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, are tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group might not be recoverable. These include, but are not limited to, material declines in operational performance, a history of losses, an expectation of future losses, adverse market conditions and store closure or relocation decisions. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews for indicators of impairment at the individual store level, the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.\nStores that display an indicator of impairment are subjected to an impairment assessment. The Company's impairment assessment requires management to make assumptions and judgments related, but not limited, to management's expectations for future operations and projected cash flows. The key assumptions used in the Company's undiscounted future store cash flow models include sales, gross profit and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses.\nAn impairment loss may be recognized when these undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. In the circumstance of impairment, any loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value of the Company's store-related assets is determined at the individual store level based on the highest and best use of the asset group. The key assumptions used in the Company's fair value analysis may include discounted future store cash flows and comparable market rents.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>If actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions used, there may be a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operation.\nStore assets that were tested for impairment as of February 1, 2020 and not impaired, had long-lived assets with a net book value of $139.6 million, which included $128.4 million of operating lease right-of-use assets as of February 1, 2020. These stores had undiscounted cash flows which were in the range of 100% to 150% of their respective net asset values.\nStore assets that were impaired during Fiscal 2019, had a remaining net book value of $126.7 million, which included $121.7 million of operating lease right-of-use assets, as of February 1, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Company's lease right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The Company's lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. On the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes an asset for the right to use a leased asset and a liability based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn measuring the Company's lease liabilities, the remaining lease payments are discounted to present value using a discount rate. As the rates implicit in the Company's leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the transactional currency of the lease and the lease term for the initial measurement of the lease right-of-use asset and the lease liability. For leases existing before the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate as of the date of adoption, determined using the remaining lease term as of the date of adoption. For leases commencing on or after the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, the incremental borrowing rate is determined using the remaining lease term as of the lease commencement date.\nThe Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The Company does not expect material changes to the underlying assumptions used to measure its lease liabilities as of February 1, 2020.\nAn increase or decrease of 10% in the Company's weighted-average discount rate as of February 1, 2020, would impact both the Company's total assets and total liabilities by less than 1% and would not have a material impact on the Company's pre-tax income for Fiscal 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes discussion of certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes that each of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d is useful to investors as it provides a meaningful basis to evaluate the Company's operating performance excluding the effect of certain items that the Company believes do not reflect its future operating outlook, such as certain flagship asset impairment charges, and thereby supplements investors' understanding of comparability of operations across periods. Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the Company's performance and to develop expectations for future operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used as a supplement to, and not as an alternative to, the Company's GAAP financial results, and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies.\nComparable sales\nThe Company provides comparable sales, defined as the year-over-year percentage change in the aggregate of (1) sales for stores that have been open as the same brand at least one year and whose square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year, with the prior year's net sales converted at the current year's foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and (2) digital sales with the prior year's net sales converted at the current year's foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Comparable sales exclude revenue other than store and digital sales. Management uses comparable sales to understand the drivers of year-over-year changes in net sales as well as a performance metric for certain performance-based restricted stock units. The Company believes comparable sales is a useful metric as it can assist investors in distinguishing the portion of the Company's revenue attributable to existing locations from the portion attributable to the opening or closing of stores. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is change in net sales.\nExcluded items\nThe following financial measures are disclosed on a GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding the following items, as applicable:\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financial measures (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Excluded items\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net charges related to certain legal matters\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset impairment, exclusive of flagship store exit charges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Flagship store asset impairment charges\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net charges related to certain legal matters and flagship store asset impairment charges\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income and net income per share attributable to A&F (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net charges related to certain legal matters; flagship store asset impairment charges; discrete net tax benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017; and the tax effect of pre-tax excluded items\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 199: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Certain of these financial measures are also expressed as a percentage of net sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>The Company also presents income tax expense and the effective tax rate on both a GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding the items listed under Operating income,\u201d as applicable, in the table above and discrete net tax benefits related to the Act. The tax effect of excluded items is the difference between the tax provision calculation on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFinancial information on a constant currency basis\nThe Company provides certain financial information on a constant currency basis to enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends and operating performance by removing the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management also uses financial information on a constant currency basis to award employee performance-based compensation. The effect from foreign currency exchange rates, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying the current period's foreign currency exchange rates to the prior year's results and is net of the year-over-year impact from hedging. The per diluted share effect from foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using a 26% effective tax rate.\nA reconciliation of financial metrics on a constant currency basis to GAAP for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 is as follows:\nTable 201: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except change in net sales, gross profit rate, operating income margin and per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,623,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,590,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(37,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,623,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,553,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BPS Change (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,150,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,159,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(80)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(32,421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,150,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,127,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(50)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>BPS Change (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>70,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>127,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(160)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluded items (2)\n</td> <td>(12,752\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,266\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted non-GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(160)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted non-GAAP on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(110)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per diluted share attributable to A&F\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(0.48)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excluded items, net of tax (2)\n</td> <td>(0.13\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.08\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.05)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted non-GAAP\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(0.42)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.20\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted non-GAAP on a constant currency basis\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$(0.22)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 202: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the percentage of net sales change.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 203: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Refer to RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d for details on excluded items.

These include, but are not limited to, material declines in operational performance, a history of losses, an expectation of future losses, adverse market conditions and store closure or relocation decisions. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews for indicators of impairment at the individual store level, the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.\nStores that display an indicator of impairment are subjected to an impairment assessment. The Company's impairment assessment requires management to make assumptions and judgments related, but not limited, to management's expectations for future operations and projected cash flows. The key assumptions used in the Company's undiscounted future store cash flow models include sales, gross profit and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses.\nAn impairment loss may be recognized when these undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. In the circumstance of impairment, any loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value of the Company's store-related assets is determined at the individual store level based on the highest and best use of the asset group. The key assumptions used in the Company's fair value analysis may include discounted future store cash flows and comparable market rents.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>If actual results are not consistent with the estimates and assumptions used, there may be a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operation.\nStore assets that were tested for impairment as of February 1, 2020 and not impaired, had long-lived assets with a net book value of $139.6 million, which included $128.4 million of operating lease right-of-use assets as of February 1, 2020. These stores had undiscounted cash flows which were in the range of 100% to 150% of their respective net asset values.\nStore assets that were impaired during Fiscal 2019, had a remaining net book value of $126.7 million, which included $121.7 million of operating lease right-of-use assets, as of February 1, 2020.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>The Company's lease right-of-use assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. The Company's lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. On the lease commencement date, the Company recognizes an asset for the right to use a leased asset and a liability based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn measuring the Company's lease liabilities, the remaining lease payments are discounted to present value using a discount rate. As the rates implicit in the Company's leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the transactional currency of the lease and the lease term for the initial measurement of the lease right-of-use asset and the lease liability. For leases existing before the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate as of the date of adoption, determined using the remaining lease term as of the date of adoption. For leases commencing on or after the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, the incremental borrowing rate is determined using the remaining lease term as of the lease commencement date.\nThe Company estimates its incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, based on the rate of interest that the Company would have to pay to borrow, on a collateralized basis over a similar term, an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>The Company does not expect material changes to the underlying assumptions used to measure its lease liabilities as of February 1, 2020.\nAn increase or decrease of 10% in the Company's weighted-average discount rate as of February 1, 2020, would impact both the Company's total assets and total liabilities by less than 1% and would not have a material impact on the Company's pre-tax income for Fiscal 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal 2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except ratios)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Tax Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Effective Tax Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deduct:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax effect of pre-tax excluded items (1)\n</td> <td>4,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefits related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted non-GAAP income tax expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.1%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross profit\nPrimary sources of cash\nWith the wellbeing of our customers, associates and business partners in mind, we temporarily closed our Company-operated stores across brands in North America and Europe, effective March 15, 2020 and March 16, 2020, respectively, and expect these stores to remain closed until further notice.

The year-over-year decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018 reflects: a lower net income in the current year as compared to the prior year; changes in the timing of payments to vendors, including increased payments in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year; partially offset by decreased incentive compensation payments in Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year and changes in inventories.\nIn the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a nine year service and distribution agreement for a facility to be located in the Phoenix, Arizona area, with services expected to commence in Fiscal 2021.

We experienced decreased traffic in the United Kingdom and declining values of the Euro and British Pound as compared to the U.S. Dollar over the last year. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could also adversely impact other areas of our business, including, but not limited to, an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of merchandise from our Netherlands distribution center to our customers in the United Kingdom if trade barriers materialize. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could also adversely impact the operations of our vendors and of our other third-party partners.\nINTRODUCTION\nFor Fiscal 2019, net sales increased 1% as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in units sold. Average unit retail was approximately flat year-over-year with changes in foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacting net sales by $37 million or 1%. In addition, the Company estimates that COVID-19 adversely impacted Fiscal 2019 net sales by approximately $4 million. Excluding the adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net sales for Fiscal 2019 increased 2% as compared to Fiscal 2018.\nCURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK\n \u2022 Improving our customer engagement through our loyalty programs and marketing optimization. \nInvesting activities - For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, net cash outflows for investing activities were used for purchases of property and equipment.\n\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures. MD&A provides a discussion of certain financial measures that have been determined to not be in accordance with GAAP. This section includes certain reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures and additional details on these financial measures, including information as to why the Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures provided within MD&A are useful to investors. \nThe following measurements are among the key performance indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Company's results:\nRecently, there has been uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, such as the threat of additional tariffs on imported consumer goods from China. A summary of certain recent tariffs impacting our business include:\nOur robust digital operations across brands remain open to serve our customers during this unprecedented period of temporary store closures.\nFurther details related to sales for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 are as follows:\nNet income per diluted share attributable to A&F\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Company believes the following policies are the most critical to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nKey performance indicators\n \u2022 Evolved our loyalty programs, Club Cali and myAbercrombie, and rolled these programs out in China. \n (4) Amount reflects net legal charges in connection with a then proposed settlement of a class action claim, which received final court approval and was paid in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018.

Words such as estimate,\u201d project,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability are difficult to predict. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties in the forward-looking statements included herein, including the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company, or any other person, that the objectives of the Company will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on information presently available to the management of the Company. Except as may be required by applicable law, the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \n \u2022 Results of Operations. This section provides an analysis of certain components of the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018. \nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom passed a referendum to recommend withdrawing from the European Union. Although the United Kingdom left the European Union in January 2020, the final terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal remain unclear. As a result, there is continued uncertainty related to consumer behavior, trade relations, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rates and the free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the United Kingdom and the European Union during this time of transition.\nReflecting a continued focus on our key transformation initiative \u2018Global Store Network Optimization,' we delivered new store experiences across brands during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019. Details related to our new store experiences follow:\n \u2022 Delivered 157 new store experiences through new stores, remodels and right-sizes; \nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes discussion of certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes that each of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d is useful to investors as it provides a meaningful basis to evaluate the Company's operating performance excluding the effect of certain items that the Company believes do not reflect its future operating outlook, such as certain flagship asset impairment charges, and thereby supplements investors' understanding of comparability of operations across periods. Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the Company's performance and to develop expectations for future operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used as a supplement to, and not as an alternative to, the Company's GAAP financial results, and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies.\nWe ended Fiscal 2019 on a strong note, and recorded our third consecutive full year of sales growth, despite the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million. In Fiscal 2019, Abercrombie outperformed Hollister and the United States outperformed international. In the near-term, we are focused on navigating the recent challenges presented by COVID-19, as discussed above. We believe there is too much uncertainty to provide an estimated impact of COVID-19 at this time or a full year outlook for Fiscal 2020.

The Company entered this period of uncertainty with a healthy liquidity position and is taking immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance the Company's ability to meet the business' short-term liquidity needs, in order to best position the business for its key stakeholders, including the Company's associates, customers and shareholders. As a precautionary measure, in March 2020, the Company borrowed $210 million under its asset-based revolving credit facility to improve the Company's cash position and withdrew the majority of excess funds from its overfunded Rabbi Trust assets, which provided the Company with $50 million of additional cash. The Company believes that it will have adequate liquidity to fund operating activities over the next 12 months.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nFor Fiscal 2019, stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately flat compared to Fiscal 2018, reflecting a decrease in store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points, a decrease in compensation costs and decreased marketing expense related to the Company's digital operations. These decreases were offset primarily due to an increase in shipping and handling costs as a percentage of total net sales of approximately 60 basis points.\ninformation regarding the Company's share repurchases during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 and the number of shares remaining available for purchase under the Company's June 2019 publicly announced stock repurchase authorization.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the percentage of net sales change. \n (1) Fiscal 2019 results were adversely impacted by $47.3 million of pre-tax flagship store exit charges.

Due to the fact that future dividends are subject to determination and approval by A&F's Board of Directors, there are no amounts included in the contractual obligations table related to dividends.\nFor Fiscal 2019, marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 70 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in performance-based compensation and consulting expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increased information technology expense and executive severance charges. Excluding the net charges related to certain legal matters presented above, Fiscal 2019 adjusted non-GAAP marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 60 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018.\n (1) Comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis and exclude revenue other than store and digital sales.

This section discusses accounting policies considered to be important to the Company's results of operations and financial condition, which typically require significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in their application. \nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company had not drawn on the Amended ABL Facility, but had availability under the Amended ABL facility of $272.0 million, net of $0.8 million in outstanding stand-by letters of credit. As the Company must maintain excess availability equal to the greater of 10% of the loan cap or $30 million under the Amended ABL Facility, actual incremental borrowing available to the Company and under the Amended ABL Facility was $242.0 million as of February 1, 2020. As a precautionary measure in response to COVID-19, in March 2020, the Company borrowed $210 million under the Amended ABL Facility to improve its cash position. Refer to Note 22, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS,\u201d for further discussion.\n (1) Refer to Operating income\u201d for details of pre-tax excluded items. The tax effect of pre-tax excluded items is the difference between the tax provision calculation on a GAAP basis and an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \n\n\nGlobal Store Network Optimization\nDue to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year and we could have significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts. The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the fall season, the third and fourth fiscal quarters, due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods, respectively.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nFinancing activities - For Fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of the repurchase of approximately 4.0 million shares of A&F's Common Stock in the open market with a market value of approximately $63.5 million, dividend payments of $51.5 million and voluntary debt repayments of $20.0 million. For Fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of approximately 2.9 million shares of A&F's Common Stock in the open market with a market value of approximately $68.7 million and dividend payments of $53.7 million.\n (2) Upon closure, the abercrombie kids store in London will be converted to corporate office space and the location will be utilized as our EMEA regional headquarters. \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

Our team had taken actions to proactively prepare for the impacts of these tariffs, including shifting production into other countries and regions to both existing and new partners as necessary. Only a portion of our total goods sourced from China are imported into the U.S. and are subject to these additional tariffs. For context, approximately 15% and 25% of total merchandise receipts were sourced from China and imported to the U.S. in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, and we expect to reduce this percentage in Fiscal 2020.\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\n \u2022 Customer-centric metrics such as customer satisfaction, brand health scores and certain metrics related to the loyalty programs. \n - Fiscal 2015 through Fiscal 2017 \nShare repurchases and dividends\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nPrimary uses of cash\n\nStore count and gross square footage by brand and geography as of February 2, 2019 and February 1, 2020 were as follows:\n (2) Comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis and exclude revenue other than store and digital sales.

We source the majority of our merchandise outside of the U.S. through arrangements with vendors primarily located in southeast Asia. In order to complete production, these vendors' manufacturing factories are dependent on raw materials from fabric mills that are primarily located in the Asia-Pacific region. We are collaborating with our third-party partners to mitigate significant delays in delivery of merchandise, as certain factories have been closed, and certain other factories are operating at a limited capacity.\n (2) Amounts reflect asset impairment charges related to certain of the Company's flagship stores not associated with exit activities. \nDividends are declared at the discretion of A&F's Board of Directors. A quarterly dividend, of $0.20 per share outstanding, was declared in each of February, May, August and November in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. Dividends were paid in each of March, June, September and December in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. A&F's Board of Directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis and establishes the dividend amount based on A&F's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects and other factors, including the potential severity of impacts to the business resulting from COVID-19 and any restrictions related to the Company's Credit Facilities. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nAs a result of COVID 19, in January 2020, we began to experience business disruptions in the Asia-Pacific region, including the temporary closure of stores in China and the surrounding area, modified operating hours in certain stores that remained open, and a decline in traffic. In late February 2020, the situation escalated as the scope of COVID-19 worsened beyond the Asia-Pacific region, with Europe and the United States experiencing significant outbreaks. In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to COVID-19, certain governments have imposed travel restrictions and local statutory quarantines. We are monitoring and reacting to the COVID-19 situation on a daily basis, including by conforming to local government and global health organizations' guidance; implementing global travel restrictions; and recommending associates who are able to perform their role remotely to do so.\nSeasonality of cash flows\n\n (2) The Company also presents income tax expense and the effective tax rate on both a GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding the items listed under Operating income,\u201d as applicable, in the table above and discrete net tax benefits related to the Act. The tax effect of excluded items is the difference between the tax provision calculation on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \n\nFor Fiscal 2019, cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 80 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in average unit cost, without a corresponding increase in average unit retail. The increase in average unit cost reflects the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedging, of approximately 30 basis points, higher year-over-year shrink of approximately 20 basis points, increased freight costs and the adverse impact from List 3 and List 4A China tariffs of approximately 10 basis points.\nThe Company provides certain financial information on a constant currency basis to enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends and operating performance by removing the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management also uses financial information on a constant currency basis to award employee performance-based compensation. The effect from foreign currency exchange rates, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying the current period's foreign currency exchange rates to the prior year's results and is net of the year-over-year impact from hedging. The per diluted share effect from foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using a 26% effective tax rate.\nWe are a global multi-brand omnichannel specialty retailer, with operations in North America, Europe and Asia, among other regions and, as a result, we are mindful of macroeconomic risks and global challenges that could adversely impact certain areas of our business. As a result, in addition to the events listed below, we continue to monitor certain other global events. Our team continues to assess the potential impacts these events and similar events may have on the business in future periods and continues to develop contingency plans to assist in mitigating potential impacts. It is possible that our preparations for the events listed below are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect our business and results of operations. For discussion of significant risks that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA summary of results for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 follows:\nRefer to Note 2, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Recent accounting pronouncements,\u201d for recent accounting pronouncements the Company has adopted or is currently evaluating, including the dates of adoption or expected dates of adoption, as applicable, and anticipated effects on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Equipped our associates with handheld devices to improve shopping and checkout; \n (1) The estimated basis point ( BPS\u201d) change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n (2) Refer to RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d for details on excluded items. The tax effect of excluded items is calculated as the difference between the tax provision on a GAAP basis and an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \n (1) Operating lease obligations consist of the Company's future undiscounted operating lease payments, including future fixed lease payments associated with closed flagship stores. Operating lease obligations do not include variable payments related to both lease and nonlease components, such as contingent rent payments made by the Company based on performance, and payments related to taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Total variable lease cost was $143.5 million in Fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 2, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Leases,\u201d and Note 7, LEASES,\u201d for further discussion. \n \u2022 Phase II: Growing while Transforming \nCOVID-19\nThe following financial measures are disclosed on a GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding the following items, as applicable:\nA reconciliation of financial metrics on a constant currency basis to GAAP for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 is as follows:\nThe Company's capital allocation strategy, priorities and investments are reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors considering both liquidity and valuation factors, including the potential severity of impacts to the business resulting from COVID-19.\nGross profit is derived from cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nThe Company provides comparable sales, defined as the year-over-year percentage change in the aggregate of (1) sales for stores that have been open as the same brand at least one year and whose square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year, with the prior year's net sales converted at the current year's foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and (2) digital sales with the prior year's net sales converted at the current year's foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Comparable sales exclude revenue other than store and digital sales. Management uses comparable sales to understand the drivers of year-over-year changes in net sales as well as a performance metric for certain performance-based restricted stock units. The Company believes comparable sales is a useful metric as it can assist investors in distinguishing the portion of the Company's revenue attributable to existing locations from the portion attributable to the opening or closing of stores. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is change in net sales.\nThe current circumstances are dynamic and the impacts of COVID-19 on our business operations, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, although we anticipate COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in Fiscal 2020.\n\nOn June 22, 2018, the Company, through its subsidiary A&F Management, entered into a Second Amendment to Term Loan Credit Agreement, which, among other things, repriced the Term Loan Facility by reducing the applicable margins for term loans by 0.25%.\n \u2022 Operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales ( operating income margin\u201d); \n \u2022 Increasing the speed and efficiency of our concept-to-customer product life cycle by further investing in capabilities to position our supply chain for greater speed, agility and efficiency, while leveraging data and analytics to offer the right product at the right time and the right price; and \nDuring Phase I, Stabilizing while Transforming,\u201d we transformed the organization by centering it around the customer, which included developing playbooks with the customer in mind, that align product, brand voice and experience. Transforming the organization included implementing a new brand-centric organizational structure, with branded core customer-facing functions. This built the foundation for the growth experienced across brands, channels and geographies in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017. As our brands gained momentum, we ended this phase with a strong balance sheet, reduced fixed costs and improved real estate productivity.\nThe Company's current capital allocation strategy is to prioritize navigating the near-term challenges that COVID-19 presents and continuing to fund operating activities. In response to COVID-19, the Company is taking immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance the Company's ability to meet the business' short-term liquidity needs. As a result, over the next twelve months, the Company's expects its primary cash requirements to be towards funding operating activities, including the acquisition of inventory, and obligations related to compensation, leases and any lease buyouts or modifications it may exercise, taxes and other operating activities.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nList 3 and List 4A tariffs adversely impacted Fiscal 2019 cost of merchandise and gross profit by approximately $4 million. These tariffs are not expected to have a significant year-over-year impact on cost of merchandise and gross profit in Fiscal 2020.\n (2) Excludes items presented above under Operating income,\u201d and Income tax expense.\u201d \n (4) Fiscal 2019 results include $47.3 million of flagship store exit charges, which adversely impacted operating margin by 130 basis points and net income per diluted share attributable to A&F by approximately $0.53 per share, net of estimated tax effect. Refer to Note 19, FLAGSHIP STORE EXIT CHARGES.\u201d \n (1) Refer to RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d for details on excluded items. Discussion as to why the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors is provided below under NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.\u201d \nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation of flagship store exit charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. This change in presentation resulted in decreases of $5.8 million and $2.4 million in stores and distribution expense, and corresponding increases in flagship store exit charges for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.\n (2) Abercrombie includes the Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. Locations with abercrombie kids carveouts within Abercrombie & Fitch stores are represented as a single store count. Excludes seven international franchise stores as of each of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019. Excludes eight U.S. Company-operated temporary stores as of February 1, 2020. \n \u2022 Transactional metrics such as traffic and conversion, performance across key product categories, average unit retail, average unit cost, average units per transaction and average transaction values; \nDue to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of future payments, tax related to uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest and penalties, of $2.3 million as of February 1, 2020 is excluded from the contractual obligations table. Deferred taxes are also excluded in the preceding table. For further discussion, refer to Note 11, INCOME TAXES.\u201d\nOver Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019, the first two years of Phase II, Growing while Transforming,\u201d we have made significant progress against our transformation initiatives as we:\n (2) Purchase obligations primarily consist of non-cancelable purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Fiscal 2020 and commitments for fabric expected to be used during upcoming seasons. In addition, purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services, including information technology contracts and third-party distribution center service contracts. \nOn October 19, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiary A&F Management, entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the ABL Second Amendment\u201d), amending and extending the maturity date of the asset-based revolving credit agreement to October 19, 2022. As amended, the asset-based revolving credit agreement continues to provide for a senior secured credit facility of up to $400 million (the Amended ABL Facility\u201d).\nA component of optimizing our global store network is pivoting away from large format flagship stores as we strive to open smaller, more productive omnichannel focused brand experiences. As a result, we have closed certain of our flagship stores and may have additional closures as we execute against this strategy. Although some of these closures may be completed through natural lease expirations, certain other of our leases include early termination options that can be exercised under specific conditions. We may also elect to exit or modify our other leases, and could incur charges related to these actions.\nIt is possible that our preparations for the events listed above are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect our business and results of operations. For discussion of significant risks that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nWe have seen, and expect to continue to see material reductions in sales across brands and regions as a result of COVID-19. In addition, these reductions in revenue have not been offset by proportional decreases in expense, as we continue to incur store occupancy costs such as operating lease costs and depreciation expense, and certain other costs such as compensation and administrative expenses, resulting in a negative effect on the relationship between our costs and revenues.\nFor Fiscal 2019, interest expense, net as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 10 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018. Interest expense as a percentage of net sales decreased as compared to last year, primarily driven by the elimination of landlord financing obligations and the related interest expense upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard in Fiscal 2019, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to certain of the Company's long-term obligations.\n \u2022 Additional tariffs imposed on select apparel and footwear of up to 25%, which were effective beginning September 2019 at the starting rate of 15% and decreased to 7.5% in February 2020 ( List 4A\u201d).

Our plans for long-term growth are best categorized into three planned phases:\n \u2022 Reduced store gross square footage by 6% and closed four large footprint, underperforming flagship stores; \n (1) Fiscal 2019 results include $47.3 million of pre-tax flagship store exit charges, which adversely impacted net income per diluted share by $0.53, net of estimated tax effect. Refer to Note 19, FLAGSHIP STORE EXIT CHARGES.\u201d \nUnited Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d)\nRefer to Note 8, ASSET IMPAIRMENT,\u201d for further discussion.\nFor context, at the beginning of Fiscal 2019, we had 19 flagship stores, and at end of Fiscal 2019, we had 15 flagship stores. Details related to previously announced flagship store closures follow:\nFor Fiscal 2019, flagship store exit charges as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 110 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily driven by the closure of the Company's SoHo Hollister flagship in New York City during the second quarter of Fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 19, FLAGSHIP STORE EXIT CHARGES,\u201d for additional information on flagship store exit charges incurred in Fiscal 209 and Fiscal 2018.\n (2) Refer to Note 11, INCOME TAXES,\u201d for details on the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. \n \u2022 Liquidity and Capital Resources. This section provides a discussion of the Company's financial condition, changes in financial condition and liquidity as of February 1, 2020, which includes (i) an analysis of financial condition as compared to February 2, 2019, (ii) an analysis of changes in cash flows for Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018, (iii) an analysis of liquidity, including the availability under credit facilities, payments of dividends, and outstanding debt and covenant compliance, (iv) a summary of contractual and other obligations as of February 1, 2020 and (v) discussion related to preserving liquidity during COVID-19. \nMD&A is provided as a supplement to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto to help provide an understanding of the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. MD&A is organized as follows:\n (1) Certain of these financial measures are also expressed as a percentage of net sales. \n \u2022 Digital and omnichannel metrics, such as total shipping expense as a percentage of digital sales, and certain metrics related to our Purchase-Online-Pickup-in-Store and Order-in-Store programs; \nThe Company's business has two principal selling seasons: the spring season, which includes the first and second fiscal quarters ( Spring\u201d) and the fall season, which includes the third and fourth fiscal quarters ( Fall\u201d). The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the fall season, the third and fourth fiscal quarters, due to back-to-school and holiday sales periods, respectively. The Company relies on excess operating cash flows, which are largely generated in Fall, to fund operations throughout the year and to reinvest in the business to support future growth. The Company also has an asset-based revolving credit facility available as a source of additional funding.\n\n \u2022 Change in net sales and comparable sales; \nFor Fiscal 2019, other operating income, net, as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 20 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in foreign currency exchange related gains of approximately 10 basis points, reflecting the impact of the adoption of the new derivative accounting standard in Fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 2, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES,\u201d for further discussion of the new derivative accounting standard.\nThe Company also evaluates opportunities for investments in line with our key transformation initiatives that position the business for sustainable long-term growth and strives to invest in projects that have high expected returns. These improvements may include new store experiences or investments in its omnichannel initiatives or loyalty programs. In addition, the Company evaluates store closures, including flagship lease buyouts and options to early terminate store leases. Historically, the Company has utilized free cash flow generated from operations to fund any discretionary capital expenditures, which have been prioritized towards new store experiences, as well as digital and omnichannel investments, information technology, and other projects.\n \u2022 Current Trends and Outlook. This section provides a discussion related to COVID-19's impact on the Company's business and discussion of the Company's long-term plans for growth. In addition, this section also provides a summary of the Company's performance over recent years, primarily Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. \n \u2022 Cash flow and liquidity measures, such as the Company's current ratio, working capital and free cash flow; \n \u2022 Phase I: Stabilizing while Transforming \n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nAsset impairment, exclusive of flagship store exit charges\n \u2022 Marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales; \n\nCertain components of the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 were as follows:\n \u2022 Store metrics such as net sales per gross square foot, and store 4-wall operating margins; \n (1) Excludes nine international franchise stores as of February 1, 2020 and eight as of February 2, 2019. Excludes 17 U.S. Company-operated temporary stores as of February 1, 2020. \n\nGross profit\nPrimary sources of cash\nWith the wellbeing of our customers, associates and business partners in mind, we temporarily closed our Company-operated stores across brands in North America and Europe, effective March 15, 2020 and March 16, 2020, respectively, and expect these stores to remain closed until further notice. The majority of our stores in the Asia-Pacific region have reopened, although many with temporarily reduced operating hours. We plan to follow the guidance of local governments and health organizations to determine when we can reopen these stores and to evaluate whether further store closures in the Asia-Pacific region will be necessary. As the situation continues to evolve rapidly, we are not currently able to predict the timing of store reopenings, which may occur on a location-by-location basis.\nThe Company's earnings and profits from its foreign subsidiaries could be repatriated to the U.S., without incurring additional federal income tax. The Company has determined that the balance of the Company's undistributed earnings and profits from its foreign subsidiaries as of February 2, 2019 are considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S., and if these funds were to be repatriated to the U.S., the Company would expect to incur an insignificant amount of state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes. The Company accrues for both state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes with respect to earnings and profits earned after February 2, 2019, in such a manner that these funds could be repatriated without incurring additional taxes.\nIn addition, we could experience other material impacts as a result of COVID-19, including, but not limited to, charges from potential adjustments of the carrying amount of inventory, asset impairment charges, deferred tax valuation allowances and changes in the effectiveness of our hedging instruments.\nLong-term growth plans\nAs of February 1, 2020, $311.6 million of the Company's $671.3 million of cash and equivalents was held by foreign affiliates. The Company is not dependent on dividends from its foreign affiliates to fund its U.S. operations or pay dividends to A&F's stockholders.\nIncome tax expense\n (1) Fiscal 2019 results were adversely impacted by $47.3 million of pre-tax flagship store exit charges. Refer to Note 19, FLAGSHIP STORE EXIT CHARGES.\u201d \n \u2022 Enhancing digital and omnichannel capabilities; \nThe Company's two operating segments are brand-based: Hollister and Abercrombie, the latter of which includes the Company's Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands.\n \u2022 Return on invested capital and return on equity; and \n\nAt times, the Company may utilize excess liquidity, towards debt service requirements, including voluntary debt prepayments, or required repayments, if any, based on annual excess cash flows, as defined in the term loan credit agreement applicable to the Term Loan Facility.\nOperating activities - For both Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the primary source of cash from operations was from the sale of merchandise, largely generated in the Fall season. The year-over-year decrease in cash flows from operating activities for Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018 reflects: a lower net income in the current year as compared to the prior year; changes in the timing of payments to vendors, including increased payments in the first quarter of Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year; partially offset by decreased incentive compensation payments in Fiscal 2019 as compared to the prior year and changes in inventories.\nIn the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company entered into a nine year service and distribution agreement for a facility to be located in the Phoenix, Arizona area, with services expected to commence in Fiscal 2021. Due to uncertainty as to the ultimate minimum commitments related this agreement, these expected obligations are excluded from the contractual obligations table.\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company's contractual obligations were as follows:\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 Optimizing our global store network; \n\n \u2022 Phase III: Accelerating Growth \n \u2022 Implemented omnichannel capabilities, including Purchase Online Pick Up in Store and in Order in Store; \nWe believe that this referendum and the uncertainty surrounding the terms of United Kingdom's withdrawal throughout the year adversely impacted international sales results in Fiscal 2019. We experienced decreased traffic in the United Kingdom and declining values of the Euro and British Pound as compared to the U.S. Dollar over the last year. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could also adversely impact other areas of our business, including, but not limited to, an increase in duties and delays in the delivery of merchandise from our Netherlands distribution center to our customers in the United Kingdom if trade barriers materialize. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could also adversely impact the operations of our vendors and of our other third-party partners.\nINTRODUCTION\nFor Fiscal 2019, net sales increased 1% as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in units sold. Average unit retail was approximately flat year-over-year with changes in foreign currency exchange rates adversely impacting net sales by $37 million or 1%. In addition, the Company estimates that COVID-19 adversely impacted Fiscal 2019 net sales by approximately $4 million. Excluding the adverse impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net sales for Fiscal 2019 increased 2% as compared to Fiscal 2018.\nCURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK\n \u2022 Improving our customer engagement through our loyalty programs and marketing optimization. \nInvesting activities - For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, net cash outflows for investing activities were used for purchases of property and equipment.\n\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \n \u2022 Non-GAAP Financial Measures. MD&A provides a discussion of certain financial measures that have been determined to not be in accordance with GAAP. This section includes certain reconciliations for non-GAAP financial measures and additional details on these financial measures, including information as to why the Company believes the non-GAAP financial measures provided within MD&A are useful to investors. \nThe following measurements are among the key performance indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Company's results:\nRecently, there has been uncertainty with respect to trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, such as the threat of additional tariffs on imported consumer goods from China. A summary of certain recent tariffs impacting our business include:\nOur robust digital operations across brands remain open to serve our customers during this unprecedented period of temporary store closures.\nFurther details related to sales for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 are as follows:\nNet income per diluted share attributable to A&F\nThe Company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the Company's consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. Since actual results may differ from those estimates, the Company revises its estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available. The Company believes the following policies are the most critical to the portrayal of the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\nKey performance indicators\n \u2022 Evolved our loyalty programs, Club Cali and myAbercrombie, and rolled these programs out in China. \n (4) Amount reflects net legal charges in connection with a then proposed settlement of a class action claim, which received final court approval and was paid in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2018. Refer to Note 20, CONTINGENCIES.\u201d \nThe Company cautions that any forward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or made by the Company, its management or spokespeople involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which may be beyond the Company's control. Words such as estimate,\u201d project,\u201d plan,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d and similar expressions may identify forward-looking statements. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability are difficult to predict. Therefore, there can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K will prove to be accurate. In light of the significant uncertainties in the forward-looking statements included herein, including the uncertainty surrounding COVID-19, the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the Company, or any other person, that the objectives of the Company will be achieved. The forward-looking statements included herein are based on information presently available to the management of the Company. Except as may be required by applicable law, the Company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \n \u2022 Results of Operations. This section provides an analysis of certain components of the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for Fiscal 2019 as compared to Fiscal 2018. \nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom passed a referendum to recommend withdrawing from the European Union. Although the United Kingdom left the European Union in January 2020, the final terms of the United Kingdom's withdrawal remain unclear. As a result, there is continued uncertainty related to consumer behavior, trade relations, economic conditions, foreign currency exchange rates and the free movement of goods, services, people and capital between the United Kingdom and the European Union during this time of transition.\nReflecting a continued focus on our key transformation initiative \u2018Global Store Network Optimization,' we delivered new store experiences across brands during Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019. Details related to our new store experiences follow:\n \u2022 Delivered 157 new store experiences through new stores, remodels and right-sizes; \nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes discussion of certain financial measures on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis. The Company believes that each of the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d is useful to investors as it provides a meaningful basis to evaluate the Company's operating performance excluding the effect of certain items that the Company believes do not reflect its future operating outlook, such as certain flagship asset impairment charges, and thereby supplements investors' understanding of comparability of operations across periods. Management used these non-GAAP financial measures during the periods presented to assess the Company's performance and to develop expectations for future operating performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should be used as a supplement to, and not as an alternative to, the Company's GAAP financial results, and may not be calculated in the same manner as similar measures presented by other companies.\nWe ended Fiscal 2019 on a strong note, and recorded our third consecutive full year of sales growth, despite the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $37 million. In Fiscal 2019, Abercrombie outperformed Hollister and the United States outperformed international. In the near-term, we are focused on navigating the recent challenges presented by COVID-19, as discussed above. We believe there is too much uncertainty to provide an estimated impact of COVID-19 at this time or a full year outlook for Fiscal 2020. Refer to COVID-19,\u201d provided within this CURRENT TRENDS AND OUTLOOK,\u201d section for further discussion.\n\nSafe harbor statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nOperating income\nNet income attributable to A&F\n (2) Includes Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. \nComparable sales\nThe Company's primary source of cash to execute against its capital allocation strategy is its operating cash flows, largely generated in the Fall season, used to fund operations throughout the fiscal year and to reinvest in the business to support future growth. The Company entered this period of uncertainty with a healthy liquidity position and is taking immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance the Company's ability to meet the business' short-term liquidity needs, in order to best position the business for its key stakeholders, including the Company's associates, customers and shareholders. As a precautionary measure, in March 2020, the Company borrowed $210 million under its asset-based revolving credit facility to improve the Company's cash position and withdrew the majority of excess funds from its overfunded Rabbi Trust assets, which provided the Company with $50 million of additional cash. The Company believes that it will have adequate liquidity to fund operating activities over the next 12 months.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nFor Fiscal 2019, stores and distribution expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately flat compared to Fiscal 2018, reflecting a decrease in store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales of approximately 50 basis points, a decrease in compensation costs and decreased marketing expense related to the Company's digital operations. These decreases were offset primarily due to an increase in shipping and handling costs as a percentage of total net sales of approximately 60 basis points.\ninformation regarding the Company's share repurchases during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 and the number of shares remaining available for purchase under the Company's June 2019 publicly announced stock repurchase authorization.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the percentage of net sales change. \n (1) Fiscal 2019 results were adversely impacted by $47.3 million of pre-tax flagship store exit charges.

The Company may repurchase shares of its Common Stock from time to time, dependent on market and business conditions, with the primary objective to offset dilution from issuances of Common Stock associated with the exercise of employee stock appreciation rights and the vesting of restricted stock units. Shares may be repurchased in the open market, including pursuant to any trading plans established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Exchange Act, through privately negotiated transactions or other transactions or by a combination of such methods.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d in PART II of A&F's Annual Report on Form 10-K for Fiscal 2018, filed with the SEC on April 1, 2019.\nWe remain committed to our long-term vision. Upon completion of Phase II, Growing while Transforming\u201d we will move to Phase III, Accelerating Growth.\u201d In Phase III we will aim to take market share in the U.S. and grow our business globally while continuing to focus on our long-term profitability target of doubling Fiscal 2017 adjusted non-GAAP operating income margin of 2.9% through top-line growth, gross profit rate expansion and operating expense leverage.\nIncome taxes\nChina tariffs\n (2) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \n \u2022 Reduced our product development calendar by multiple weeks; \n (4) Other obligations consists of: asset retirement obligations; payments from the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan; tax payments associated with the provisional, mandatory one-time deemed repatriation tax on accumulated foreign earnings, net payable over eight years pursuant to the Act; estimated interest payments related to the Term Loan Facility based on the interest rate as of February 1, 2020 assuming normally scheduled principal payments; and minimum contractual obligations related to leases signed but not yet commenced of $3.1 million, primarily related to the Company's stores.

Our key transformation initiatives are as follows:\n (2) Refer to NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,\u201d for further details. \nA&F has historically paid quarterly dividends on its Common Stock. Due to the fact that future dividends are subject to determination and approval by A&F's Board of Directors, there are no amounts included in the contractual obligations table related to dividends.\nFor Fiscal 2019, marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 70 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily due to a decrease in performance-based compensation and consulting expenses. These decreases were partially offset by increased information technology expense and executive severance charges. Excluding the net charges related to certain legal matters presented above, Fiscal 2019 adjusted non-GAAP marketing, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 60 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018.\n (1) Comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis and exclude revenue other than store and digital sales. Refer to the discussion below in NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES,\u201d for further details on the comparable sales calculation. \nIn response to COVID-19, in line with the Company's cash preservation strategy, the Company continues to assess its plans for share repurchases and dividends. Historically, the Company has returned cash to stockholders through dividends and completes share repurchases as deemed appropriate by utilizing free cash flow generated from operations or proceeds from the Amended ABL Facility.\nIn December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law and, in May 2019, Switzerland voted to approve the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 Overview. This section provides a general description of the Company's business and certain segment information, and an overview of key performance indicators reviewed by various members of management to gauge the Company's results. \n (3) Excludes items presented above under Operating income,\u201d and Income tax expense.\u201d \n \u2022 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. This section discusses accounting policies considered to be important to the Company's results of operations and financial condition, which typically require significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in their application. \nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company had not drawn on the Amended ABL Facility, but had availability under the Amended ABL facility of $272.0 million, net of $0.8 million in outstanding stand-by letters of credit. As the Company must maintain excess availability equal to the greater of 10% of the loan cap or $30 million under the Amended ABL Facility, actual incremental borrowing available to the Company and under the Amended ABL Facility was $242.0 million as of February 1, 2020. As a precautionary measure in response to COVID-19, in March 2020, the Company borrowed $210 million under the Amended ABL Facility to improve its cash position. Refer to Note 22, SUBSEQUENT EVENTS,\u201d for further discussion.\n (1) Refer to Operating income\u201d for details of pre-tax excluded items. The tax effect of pre-tax excluded items is the difference between the tax provision calculation on a GAAP basis and an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \n\n\nGlobal Store Network Optimization\nDue to the seasonal nature of the retail apparel industry, the results of operations for any current period are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for the full fiscal year and we could have significant fluctuations in certain asset and liability accounts. The Company experiences its greatest sales activity during the fall season, the third and fourth fiscal quarters, due to Back-to-School and Holiday sales periods, respectively.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nFinancing activities - For Fiscal 2019, net cash used for financing activities primarily consisted of the repurchase of approximately 4.0 million shares of A&F's Common Stock in the open market with a market value of approximately $63.5 million, dividend payments of $51.5 million and voluntary debt repayments of $20.0 million. For Fiscal 2018, net cash used for financing activities consisted primarily of the repurchase of approximately 2.9 million shares of A&F's Common Stock in the open market with a market value of approximately $68.7 million and dividend payments of $53.7 million.\n (2) Upon closure, the abercrombie kids store in London will be converted to corporate office space and the location will be utilized as our EMEA regional headquarters. \n \u2022 Recent Accounting Pronouncements.

Our team had taken actions to proactively prepare for the impacts of these tariffs, including shifting production into other countries and regions to both existing and new partners as necessary. Only a portion of our total goods sourced from China are imported into the U.S. and are subject to these additional tariffs. For context, approximately 15% and 25% of total merchandise receipts were sourced from China and imported to the U.S. in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively, and we expect to reduce this percentage in Fiscal 2020.\nAs of February 1, 2020, the Company did not have any material off-balance sheet arrangements.\n \u2022 Customer-centric metrics such as customer satisfaction, brand health scores and certain metrics related to the loyalty programs. \n - Fiscal 2015 through Fiscal 2017 \nShare repurchases and dividends\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nPrimary uses of cash\n\nStore count and gross square footage by brand and geography as of February 2, 2019 and February 1, 2020 were as follows:\n (2) Comparable sales are calculated on a constant currency basis and exclude revenue other than store and digital sales.

As a precautionary measure, in March 2020, we borrowed $210 million under the asset-based revolving credit facility to improve our cash position and withdrew the majority of excess funds from the overfunded Rabbi Trust assets, which provided us with $50 million of additional cash.

We source the majority of our merchandise outside of the U.S. through arrangements with vendors primarily located in southeast Asia. In order to complete production, these vendors' manufacturing factories are dependent on raw materials from fabric mills that are primarily located in the Asia-Pacific region. We are collaborating with our third-party partners to mitigate significant delays in delivery of merchandise, as certain factories have been closed, and certain other factories are operating at a limited capacity.\n (2) Amounts reflect asset impairment charges related to certain of the Company's flagship stores not associated with exit activities. \nDividends are declared at the discretion of A&F's Board of Directors. A quarterly dividend, of $0.20 per share outstanding, was declared in each of February, May, August and November in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. Dividends were paid in each of March, June, September and December in Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018. A&F's Board of Directors reviews the dividend on a quarterly basis and establishes the dividend amount based on A&F's financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, current and projected cash flows, business prospects and other factors, including the potential severity of impacts to the business resulting from COVID-19 and any restrictions related to the Company's Credit Facilities. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to pay dividends in the future or, if dividends are paid, that they will be in amounts similar to past dividends.\nAs a result of COVID 19, in January 2020, we began to experience business disruptions in the Asia-Pacific region, including the temporary closure of stores in China and the surrounding area, modified operating hours in certain stores that remained open, and a decline in traffic. In late February 2020, the situation escalated as the scope of COVID-19 worsened beyond the Asia-Pacific region, with Europe and the United States experiencing significant outbreaks. In March 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared to be a global pandemic by the World Health Organization. In response to COVID-19, certain governments have imposed travel restrictions and local statutory quarantines. We are monitoring and reacting to the COVID-19 situation on a daily basis, including by conforming to local government and global health organizations' guidance; implementing global travel restrictions; and recommending associates who are able to perform their role remotely to do so.\nSeasonality of cash flows\n\n (2) The Company also presents income tax expense and the effective tax rate on both a GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding the items listed under Operating income,\u201d as applicable, in the table above and discrete net tax benefits related to the Act. The tax effect of excluded items is the difference between the tax provision calculation on a GAAP basis and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \n\nFor Fiscal 2019, cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 80 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018, primarily due to an increase in average unit cost, without a corresponding increase in average unit retail. The increase in average unit cost reflects the adverse impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net of hedging, of approximately 30 basis points, higher year-over-year shrink of approximately 20 basis points, increased freight costs and the adverse impact from List 3 and List 4A China tariffs of approximately 10 basis points.\nThe Company provides certain financial information on a constant currency basis to enhance investors' understanding of underlying business trends and operating performance by removing the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management also uses financial information on a constant currency basis to award employee performance-based compensation. The effect from foreign currency exchange rates, calculated on a constant currency basis, is determined by applying the current period's foreign currency exchange rates to the prior year's results and is net of the year-over-year impact from hedging. The per diluted share effect from foreign currency exchange rates is calculated using a 26% effective tax rate.\nWe are a global multi-brand omnichannel specialty retailer, with operations in North America, Europe and Asia, among other regions and, as a result, we are mindful of macroeconomic risks and global challenges that could adversely impact certain areas of our business. As a result, in addition to the events listed below, we continue to monitor certain other global events. Our team continues to assess the potential impacts these events and similar events may have on the business in future periods and continues to develop contingency plans to assist in mitigating potential impacts. It is possible that our preparations for the events listed below are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect our business and results of operations. For discussion of significant risks that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA summary of results for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 follows:\nRefer to Note 2, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Recent accounting pronouncements,\u201d for recent accounting pronouncements the Company has adopted or is currently evaluating, including the dates of adoption or expected dates of adoption, as applicable, and anticipated effects on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \u2022 Equipped our associates with handheld devices to improve shopping and checkout; \n (1) The estimated basis point ( BPS\u201d) change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n (2) Refer to RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,\u201d for details on excluded items. The tax effect of excluded items is calculated as the difference between the tax provision on a GAAP basis and an adjusted non-GAAP basis. \n (1) Operating lease obligations consist of the Company's future undiscounted operating lease payments, including future fixed lease payments associated with closed flagship stores. Operating lease obligations do not include variable payments related to both lease and nonlease components, such as contingent rent payments made by the Company based on performance, and payments related to taxes, insurance, and maintenance costs. Total variable lease cost was $143.5 million in Fiscal 2019. Refer to Note 2, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - Leases,\u201d and Note 7, LEASES,\u201d for further discussion. \n \u2022 Phase II: Growing while Transforming \nCOVID-19\nThe following financial measures are disclosed on a GAAP and on an adjusted non-GAAP basis excluding the following items, as applicable:\nA reconciliation of financial metrics on a constant currency basis to GAAP for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 is as follows:\nThe Company's capital allocation strategy, priorities and investments are reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors considering both liquidity and valuation factors, including the potential severity of impacts to the business resulting from COVID-19.\nGross profit is derived from cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization.\nThe Company provides comparable sales, defined as the year-over-year percentage change in the aggregate of (1) sales for stores that have been open as the same brand at least one year and whose square footage has not been expanded or reduced by more than 20% within the past year, with the prior year's net sales converted at the current year's foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, and (2) digital sales with the prior year's net sales converted at the current year's foreign currency exchange rates to remove the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Comparable sales exclude revenue other than store and digital sales. Management uses comparable sales to understand the drivers of year-over-year changes in net sales as well as a performance metric for certain performance-based restricted stock units. The Company believes comparable sales is a useful metric as it can assist investors in distinguishing the portion of the Company's revenue attributable to existing locations from the portion attributable to the opening or closing of stores. The most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is change in net sales.\nThe current circumstances are dynamic and the impacts of COVID-19 on our business operations, including the duration and impact on overall customer demand, cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, although we anticipate COVID-19 will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows in Fiscal 2020.\n\nOn June 22, 2018, the Company, through its subsidiary A&F Management, entered into a Second Amendment to Term Loan Credit Agreement, which, among other things, repriced the Term Loan Facility by reducing the applicable margins for term loans by 0.25%.\n \u2022 Operating income and operating income as a percentage of net sales ( operating income margin\u201d); \n \u2022 Increasing the speed and efficiency of our concept-to-customer product life cycle by further investing in capabilities to position our supply chain for greater speed, agility and efficiency, while leveraging data and analytics to offer the right product at the right time and the right price; and \nDuring Phase I, Stabilizing while Transforming,\u201d we transformed the organization by centering it around the customer, which included developing playbooks with the customer in mind, that align product, brand voice and experience. Transforming the organization included implementing a new brand-centric organizational structure, with branded core customer-facing functions. This built the foundation for the growth experienced across brands, channels and geographies in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2017. As our brands gained momentum, we ended this phase with a strong balance sheet, reduced fixed costs and improved real estate productivity.\nThe Company's current capital allocation strategy is to prioritize navigating the near-term challenges that COVID-19 presents and continuing to fund operating activities. In response to COVID-19, the Company is taking immediate, aggressive and prudent actions, including reevaluating all expenditures, to enhance the Company's ability to meet the business' short-term liquidity needs. As a result, over the next twelve months, the Company's expects its primary cash requirements to be towards funding operating activities, including the acquisition of inventory, and obligations related to compensation, leases and any lease buyouts or modifications it may exercise, taxes and other operating activities.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements\nList 3 and List 4A tariffs adversely impacted Fiscal 2019 cost of merchandise and gross profit by approximately $4 million. These tariffs are not expected to have a significant year-over-year impact on cost of merchandise and gross profit in Fiscal 2020.\n (2) Excludes items presented above under Operating income,\u201d and Income tax expense.\u201d \n (4) Fiscal 2019 results include $47.3 million of flagship store exit charges, which adversely impacted operating margin by 130 basis points and net income per diluted share attributable to A&F by approximately $0.53 per share, net of estimated tax effect. Refer to Note 19, FLAGSHIP STORE EXIT CHARGES.\u201d \n (1) Refer to RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\u201d for details on excluded items. Discussion as to why the Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors is provided below under NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES.\u201d \nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation of flagship store exit charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. This change in presentation resulted in decreases of $5.8 million and $2.4 million in stores and distribution expense, and corresponding increases in flagship store exit charges for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively.\n (2) Abercrombie includes the Abercrombie & Fitch and abercrombie kids brands. Locations with abercrombie kids carveouts within Abercrombie & Fitch stores are represented as a single store count. Excludes seven international franchise stores as of each of February 1, 2020 and February 2, 2019. Excludes eight U.S. Company-operated temporary stores as of February 1, 2020. \n \u2022 Transactional metrics such as traffic and conversion, performance across key product categories, average unit retail, average unit cost, average units per transaction and average transaction values; \nDue to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of future payments, tax related to uncertain tax positions, including accrued interest and penalties, of $2.3 million as of February 1, 2020 is excluded from the contractual obligations table. Deferred taxes are also excluded in the preceding table. For further discussion, refer to Note 11, INCOME TAXES.\u201d\nOver Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2019, the first two years of Phase II, Growing while Transforming,\u201d we have made significant progress against our transformation initiatives as we:\n (2) Purchase obligations primarily consist of non-cancelable purchase orders for merchandise to be delivered during Fiscal 2020 and commitments for fabric expected to be used during upcoming seasons. In addition, purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services, including information technology contracts and third-party distribution center service contracts. \nOn October 19, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiary A&F Management, entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement (the ABL Second Amendment\u201d), amending and extending the maturity date of the asset-based revolving credit agreement to October 19, 2022. As amended, the asset-based revolving credit agreement continues to provide for a senior secured credit facility of up to $400 million (the Amended ABL Facility\u201d).\nA component of optimizing our global store network is pivoting away from large format flagship stores as we strive to open smaller, more productive omnichannel focused brand experiences. As a result, we have closed certain of our flagship stores and may have additional closures as we execute against this strategy. Although some of these closures may be completed through natural lease expirations, certain other of our leases include early termination options that can be exercised under specific conditions. We may also elect to exit or modify our other leases, and could incur charges related to these actions.\nIt is possible that our preparations for the events listed above are not adequate to mitigate their impact, and that these events could further adversely affect our business and results of operations. For discussion of significant risks that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, refer to ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS,\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (1) The estimated basis point change has been rounded based on the change in the percentage of net sales. \nWe have seen, and expect to continue to see material reductions in sales across brands and regions as a result of COVID-19. In addition, these reductions in revenue have not been offset by proportional decreases in expense, as we continue to incur store occupancy costs such as operating lease costs and depreciation expense, and certain other costs such as compensation and administrative expenses, resulting in a negative effect on the relationship between our costs and revenues.\nFor Fiscal 2019, interest expense, net as a percentage of net sales decreased approximately 10 basis points as compared to Fiscal 2018. Interest expense as a percentage of net sales decreased as compared to last year, primarily driven by the elimination of landlord financing obligations and the related interest expense upon adoption of the new lease accounting standard in Fiscal 2019, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to certain of the Company's long-term obligations.\n \u2022 Additional tariffs imposed on select apparel and footwear of up to 25%, which were effective beginning September 2019 at the starting rate of 15% and decreased to 7.5% in February 2020 ( List 4A\u201d).

These include, but are not limited to, material declines in operational performance, a history of losses, an expectation of future losses, adverse market conditions and store closure or relocation decisions. On at least a quarterly basis, the Company reviews for indicators of impairment at the individual store level, the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.\nStores that display an indicator of impairment are subjected to an impairment assessment. The Company's impairment assessment requires management to make assumptions and judgments related, but not limited, to management's expectations for future operations and projected cash flows. The key assumptions used in the Company's undiscounted future store cash flow models include sales, gross profit and, to a lesser extent, operating expenses.\nAn impairment loss may be recognized when these undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group. In the circumstance of impairment, any loss would be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value. Fair value of the Company's store-related assets is determined at the individual store level based on the highest and best use of the asset group.

As the rates implicit in the Company's leases are not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the transactional currency of the lease and the lease term for the initial measurement of the lease right-of-use asset and the lease liability. For leases existing before the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate as of the date of adoption, determined using the remaining lease term as of the date of adoption. For leases commencing on or after the adoption of the new lease accounting standard, the incremental borrowing rate is determined using the remaining lease term as of the lease commencement date.\nThe
