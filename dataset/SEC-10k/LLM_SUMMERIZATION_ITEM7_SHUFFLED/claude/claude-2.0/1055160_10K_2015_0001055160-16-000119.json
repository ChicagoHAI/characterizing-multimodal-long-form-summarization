Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGENERAL\nWe are a REIT primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in residential mortgage assets, including Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS, residential whole loans and CRT securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had total assets of approximately $13.167 billion, of which $11.173 billion, or 84.9%, represented our MBS portfolio. At such date, our MBS portfolio was comprised of $4.752 billion of Agency MBS and $6.421 billion of Non-Agency MBS which includes $3.795 billion of Legacy Non-Agency MBS and $2.626 billion of RPL/NPL MBS. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had approximately $895.1 million in residential whole loans acquired through our consolidated trusts, which represented approximately 6.8% of our total assets. Our remaining investment-related assets were primarily comprised of collateral obtained in connection with reverse repurchase agreements, cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), CRT securities, MBS-related receivables, derivative instruments, and REO.\nThe results of our business operations are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets, which is driven by numerous factors, including the supply and demand for residential mortgage assets in the marketplace, the terms and availability of adequate financing, general economic and real estate conditions (both on a national and local level), the impact of government actions in the real estate and mortgage sector, and the credit performance of our credit sensitive residential mortgage assets. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS, the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties. Interest rates and conditional prepayment rates (or CPRs) (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nWith respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of our MBS portfolio and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to decline; (iii) coupons on our ARM-MBS to reset, on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our MBS to decline, thereby slowing the amortization of our MBS purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; (ii) the value of our MBS portfolio and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to increase; (iii) coupons on our ARM-MBS to reset, on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our MBS to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our MBS purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to decrease. In addition, our borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by the type of collateral we pledge and general conditions in the credit market.\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, generally meaning that we are subject to credit losses in these portfolios that correspond to the risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure on the underlying real estate collateral. (See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors - Credit Risks\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), We believe the discounted purchase prices paid on certain of these investments mitigates our risk of loss in the event that, as we expect on most such investments, we receive less than 100% of the par value of these securities or loans. Our investment process for credit sensitive assets involves analysis focused primarily on quantifying and pricing credit risk.\nThe table below presents the composition of our MBS portfolios with respect to repricing characteristics as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Underlying Mortgages\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency MBS\nFair Value (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency MBS\nFair Value (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\nMBS (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Percent\nof Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hybrids in contractual fixed-rate period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,411,282\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>416,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,827,672\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hybrids in adjustable period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,489,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,104,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,593,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>15-year fixed rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,780,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,728\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,788,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Greater than 15-year fixed rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,206,565\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Floaters\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,751,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,794,951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,546,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable in the amount of $1.0 million.\n(2) Does not reflect $2.626 billion of RPL/NPL MBS, which are re-performing deals with both fixed rate and hybrid re-performing loans. These deal structures contain a coupon step-up of 300 basis points at 36 months or sooner from issuance.\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately $7.449 billion, or 66.7%, of our MBS portfolio was in its contractual fixed-rate period or were fixed-rate MBS and approximately $3.723 billion, or 33.3%, was in its contractual adjustable-rate period, or were floating rate MBS with interest rates that reset monthly. Our ARM-MBS in their contractual adjustable-rate period primarily include MBS collateralized by Hybrids for which the initial fixed-rate period has elapsed, such that the interest rate will typically adjust on an annual or semiannual basis.\nPremiums arise when we acquire MBS at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such MBS (i.e., par value). Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire MBS at a price below the principal balance of the mortgages securing such MBS or acquire residential whole loans at a price below the principal balance of the mortgage. Premiums paid on our MBS are amortized against interest income and accretable purchase discounts on these investments are accreted to interest income. Purchase premiums on our MBS, which are primarily carried on our Agency MBS, are amortized against interest income over the life of each security using the effective yield method, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. An increase in the prepayment rate, as measured by the CPR, will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the internal rate of return (or IRR)/interest income earned on such assets.\nCPR levels are impacted by, among other things, conditions in the housing market, new regulations, government and private sector initiatives, interest rates, availability of credit to home borrowers, underwriting standards and the economy in general. In particular, CPR reflects the conditional repayment rate (or CRR), which measures voluntary prepayments of mortgages collateralizing a particular MBS, and the conditional default rate (or CDR), which measures involuntary prepayments resulting from defaults. CPRs on Agency MBS and Legacy Non-Agency MBS may differ significantly. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a weighted average CPR of 13.2%, and our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio experienced a CPR of 14.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a weighted average CPR of 13.0%, and our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio (including Legacy Non-Agency MBS underlying our Linked Transactions) experienced a CPR of 12.3%. Over the last consecutive eight quarters, ending with December 31, 2015, the monthly fair value weighted average CPR on our Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolios ranged from a high of 16.7% experienced during the month ended July 31, 2015 to a low of 10.4%, experienced during each of the months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, with an average CPR over such quarters of 13.1%.\nOur method of accounting for Non-Agency MBS purchased at significant discounts to par value, requires us to make assumptions with respect to each security. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, future interest rates, voluntary prepayment rates, default rates, mortgage modifications and loss severities. As part of our Non-Agency MBS surveillance process, we track and compare each security's actual performance over time to the performance expected at the time of purchase or, if we have modified our original purchase assumptions, to our revised performance expectations. To the extent that actual performance or our expectation of future performance of our Non-Agency MBS deviates materially from our expected performance parameters, we may revise our performance expectations, such that the amount of purchase discount designated as credit discount may be increased or decreased over time. Nevertheless, credit losses greater than those anticipated or in excess of the recorded purchase discount could occur, which could materially adversely impact our operating results.\nIt is our business strategy to hold our MBS as long-term investments. On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our ability and intent to continue to hold each security and, as part of this process, we monitor our securities for other-than-temporary impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of our securities that are in an unrealized loss position, or a deterioration in the underlying characteristics of these securities, could result in our recognizing future impairment charges or a loss upon the sale of any such security. At December 31, 2015, we had net unrealized gains of $28.8 million on our Agency MBS, comprised of gross unrealized gains of $69.2 million and gross unrealized losses of $40.4 million, and net unrealized gains on our Non-Agency MBS of $559.0 million, comprised of gross unrealized gains of $587.3 million and gross unrealized losses of $28.4 million. At December 31, 2015, we did not intend to sell any of our MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, and we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell those securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at their maturity.\nWe rely primarily on borrowings under repurchase agreements to finance our Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS. Our MBS have longer-term contractual maturities than our borrowings under repurchase agreements. Even though the majority of our MBS have interest rates that adjust over time based on short-term changes in corresponding interest rate indices (typically following an initial fixed-rate period for our Hybrids), the interest rates we pay on our borrowings will typically change at a faster pace than the interest rates we earn on our MBS. In order to reduce this interest rate risk exposure, we may enter into derivative instruments, which at December 31, 2015 were comprised of Swaps.\nOur Swap derivative instruments are designated as cash-flow hedges against a portion of our current and forecasted LIBOR-based repurchase agreements. Our Swaps do not extend the maturities of our repurchase agreements; they do, however, lock in a fixed rate of interest over their term for the notional amount of the Swap corresponding to the hedged item. During 2015, we did not enter into any new Swaps and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $710.2 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.96% amortize and/or expire. At December 31, 2015, we had Swaps designated in hedging relationships with an aggregate notional amount of $3.050 billion with a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.82% and a weighted average variable interest rate received of 0.34%.\nRecent Market Conditions and Our Strategy\nDuring 2015, we continued to invest in residential mortgage assets, including both MBS and, through consolidated trusts, residential whole loans. At December 31, 2015, our MBS portfolio was approximately $11.173 billion compared to $12.573 billion (including $1.913 billion MBS reported as components of Linked Transactions) at December 31, 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, $6.421 billion, or 57.5% of our MBS portfolios was invested in Non-Agency MBS. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the fair value of our Non-Agency MBS holdings increased by $1.665 billion. The primary components of the change during the year in these Non-Agency MBS include the reclassification of $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS that were previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions and $1.734 billion of purchases (at a weighted average purchase price of 99.9%). Partially offsetting these increases were $1.845 billion of principal repayments and other principal reductions, a decrease reflecting Non-Agency MBS price changes of $66.3 million and the sale of Non-Agency MBS with a fair value of $70.8 million.\nAt December 31, 2015, $4.752 billion, or 42.5% of our MBS portfolio was invested in Agency MBS. During the year ended 2015, the fair value of our Agency MBS decreased by $1.152 billion. This was due to $1.059 billion of principal repayments,$41.2 million of premium amortization and a $51.3 million decrease in net unrealized gains.\nIn this low interest rate environment, we continue to transition to more credit sensitive, less interest sensitive residential mortgage assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased through consolidated trusts residential whole loans of approximately $608.3 million, with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $770.5 million. At December 31, 2015, our total recorded investment in residential whole loans was $895.1 million. Of this amount, $271.8 million is presented as residential whole loans at carrying value and $623.3 million as residential whole loans at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $16.0 million of income on residential whole loans held at carrying value in Interest Income on our consolidated statement of operations, representing an effective yield of 6.63% (excluding servicing costs). In addition, we recorded net gains on residential whole loans held at fair value of $17.7 million in Other Income, net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWe currently expect to continue to seek more credit sensitive, less interest rate sensitive residential mortgage assets during 2016, particularly residential whole loans and Non-Agency MBS (including RPL/NPL MBS). In order to achieve our current investment strategy, we may continue to permit more interest rate sensitive Agency MBS to pay down.\nIn addition to our investments in Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, we invest in CRT securities, which are debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. At December 31, 2015, our investments in these securities totaled $183.6 million.\nNew accounting guidance that was effective at the beginning of the year prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting. Accordingly, on adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2015, we reclassified $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS and $4.6 million of CRT securities that were previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions to Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities respectively on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, liabilities of $1.520 billion that were previously presented as a component of Linked Transactions were reclassified to Repurchase agreements on the consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, an amount of $4.5 million representing net unrealized gains on securities previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions as of December 31, 2014 was reclassified from Accumulated deficit to AOCI (See Notes 2(t) and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOur book value per common share was $7.47 as of December 31, 2015. Book value per common share decreased from $8.12 as of December 31, 2014 due primarily to the impact of realized gains on sales and discount accretion income on Legacy Non-Agency MBS that was recognized and paid as dividends during the year, the change in the value of our Swaps, and lower unrealized gains on our Agency MBS and Legacy Non-Agency MBS, resulting from lower asset values.\nAt the end of 2015, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2014, due to prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 18 basis points to 2.78% for 2015 from 2.96% for 2014. The net Agency MBS yield decreased to 2.00% for 2015, from 2.23% for 2014. The net yield for our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio was 7.62% for 2015 compared to 7.74% for 2014. The decrease in the net yield on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio is primarily due to prepayments on higher yielding assets in the portfolio, partially offset by increases in accretable discount due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the current and prior year, that have occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. The net yield for our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio was 3.68% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 3.69% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the comparable prior period, the majority of our RPL/NPL MBS were reported as Linked Transactions.\nWe believe that our $787.5 million Credit Reserve and OTTI appropriately factors in remaining uncertainties regarding underlying mortgage performance and the potential impact on future cash flows for our existing Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Home price appreciation and underlying mortgage loan amortization have decreased the LTV for many of the mortgages underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Home price appreciation during the past few years has generally been driven by a combination of limited housing supply, low mortgage rates, capital flows into own-to-rent foreclosure purchases and demographic-driven U.S. household formation. We estimate that the average LTV of mortgage loans underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS has declined from approximately 105% as of January 2012 to approximately 71% as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we estimate that the percentage of non-delinquent loans underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS that are underwater (with LTVs greater than 100%), has declined from approximately 52% as of January 2012 to 7% at December 31, 2015. Lower LTVs lessen the likelihood of defaults and simultaneously decrease loss severities. Further, during 2014 and 2015, we have also observed faster voluntary prepayment (i.e. prepayment of loans in full with no loss) speeds than originally projected. The yields on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS that were purchased at a discount are generally positively impacted if prepayment rates on these securities exceed our prepayment assumptions. Based on these current conditions, we have reduced estimated future losses within our Legacy Non-Agency portfolio. As a result, during the year ended 2015, $41.1 million was transferred from Credit Reserve to accretable discount. This increase in accretable discount is expected to increase the interest income realized over the remaining life of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS. The remaining average contractual life of such assets is approximately 20 years, but based on scheduled loan amortization and prepayments (both voluntary and involuntary), loan balances will decline substantially over time. Consequently, we believe that the majority of the impact on interest income from the reduction in Credit Reserve will occur over the next ten years.\nAt December 31, 2015, we have access to various sources of liquidity which we estimate to be in excess of $571.0 million. This amount includes (i) $165.0 million of cash and cash equivalents; (ii) $241.7 million in estimated financing available from unpledged Agency MBS and from other Agency MBS collateral that is currently pledged in excess of contractual requirements; and (iii) $164.3 million in estimated financing available from unpledged Non-Agency MBS. Consequently, we believe that we are positioned to continue to take advantage of investment opportunities within the residential mortgage marketplace. In 2016, we intend to continue to selectively acquire MBS and residential whole loans. In addition, while the majority of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS will not return their full face value due to loan defaults, we believe that they will deliver attractive loss adjusted yields due to our discounted average amortized cost of 75% of face value at December 31, 2015.\nRepurchase agreement funding for both Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS continues to be available to us from multiple counterparties. Typically, repurchase agreement funding involving Non-Agency MBS is available from fewer counterparties, at terms requiring higher collateralization and higher interest rates, than for repurchase agreement funding involving Agency MBS. In July 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MFA Insurance, became a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, further diversifying our potential sources of funding for residential mortgage investments. However, in January, 2016, the FHFA released its final rule amending its regulation on FHLB membership, which, amongst other things, provided termination rules for current captive insurance members. As a result of such regulation, MFA Insurance will not be permitted new advances or renewal of existing advances and will be required to terminate its FHLB membership within one year of the rule's effective date of February 19, 2016. At December 31, 2015, our debt consisted of borrowings under repurchase agreements with 27 counterparties, FHLB advances, securitized debt, Senior Notes outstanding and obligation to return securities obtained as collateral, resulting in a debt-to-equity multiple of 3.4 times. (See table on page 55 under Results of Operations that presents our quarterly leverage multiples since March 31, 2014.)\nInformation About Our Assets\nThe tables below present certain information

Prior to January 1, 2015, for GAAP financial reporting purposes, we were required to account for these items as Linked Transactions. Consequently, the presentation of this information in the above tables constitutes Non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, as promulgated by the SEC.\nIn assessing the performance of our Non-Agency MBS portfolio prior to January 1, 2015, we did not view these transactions as linked, but rather viewed the performance of the underlying Non-Agency MBS and the related repurchase agreement borrowings as we would any other Non-Agency MBS that was not part of a linked transaction. Accordingly, as Linked Transaction accounting was discontinued on January 1, 2015, we consider that the Non-GAAP information disclosed in the above table for prior periods provides appropriate comparability to current period disclosures for our Non-Agency MBS portfolio.\nActual maturities of MBS are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities because actual maturities of MBS are affected by the contractual lives of the underlying mortgage loans, periodic payments of principal, and prepayments of principal.

As the unit of account is at the pool level rather than the individual loan level, none of our residential whole loans at carrying value are currently considered 90 days or more past due.\nExposure to Financial Counterparties\nWe finance a significant portion of our MBS and CRT securities with repurchase agreements and other advances. In connection with these financing arrangements, we pledge our securities as collateral to secure the borrowing. The amount of collateral pledged will typically exceed the amount of the financing with the extent of over-collateralization ranging from 1%-6% of the amount borrowed (U.S. Treasury and Agency MBS collateral) to up to 64% (Non-Agency MBS collateral). Consequently, while repurchase agreement financing results in us recording a liability to the counterparty in our consolidated balance sheets, we are exposed to the counterparty, if during the term of the repurchase agreement financing, a lender should default on its obligation and we are not able to recover our pledged assets. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral.\nIn addition, we use interest rate Swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure in connection with our repurchase agreement financings. We will make cash payments or pledge securities as collateral as part of a margin arrangement in connection with interest rate Swaps that are in an unrealized loss position. In the event that a counterparty for a Swap that is not subject to central clearing were to default on its obligation, we would be exposed to a loss to a Swap counterparty to the extent that the amount of cash or securities pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated Swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral.\nThe table below summarizes our exposure to our

December 31, 2015, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\nWeak economic conditions in Europe could potentially impact our major European financial counterparties, with the possibility that this would also impact the operations of their U.S. domiciled subsidiaries. This could adversely affect our financing and operations as well as those of the entire mortgage sector in general. Management monitors our exposure to our repurchase agreement and Swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions\nor other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements and/or the fair value of Swaps with our counterparties. We intend to make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements, or take other necessary actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when such actions are considered necessary.\nTax Considerations\nCurrent period estimated taxable and items expected to impact future taxable income\nWe estimate that for 2015, our taxable income was approximately $307.5 million. Based on dividends paid or declared during 2015, we have undistributed taxable income of approximately $7.6 million, or $0.02 per share. We have until the filing of our 2015 tax return (due not later than September 15, 2016) to declare the distribution of any 2015 REIT taxable income not previously distributed.\nCertain events that are expected to occur over the next few quarters are anticipated to impact the amount of taxable income generated, including (i) the unwind of a resecuritization transaction, which is currently expected to generate taxable income of approximately $0.19 per share, and (ii) the receipt of our share of settlement proceeds in connection with the $8.5 billion settlement of the Bank of America/Countrywide MBS litigation, which is expected to generate taxable income of approximately $0.05 per share.\nKey differences between GAAP net income and REIT Taxable Income for Non-Agency MBS and Residential Whole Loans\nOur total Non-Agency MBS portfolio for tax differs from our portfolio reported for GAAP primarily due to the fact that for tax purposes; (i) certain of the MBS contributed to the variable interest entities (or VIEs) used to facilitate resecuritization transactions were deemed to be sold; and (ii) the tax portfolio includes certain securities issued by these VIEs. In addition, for our Non-Agency MBS tax portfolio, potential timing differences arise with respect to the accretion of market discount into income and recognition of realized losses for tax purposes as compared to GAAP. Consequently, our REIT taxable income calculated in a given period may differ significantly from our GAAP net income.\nThe determination of taxable income attributable to Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans is dependent on a number of factors, including principal payments, defaults, loss mitigation efforts and loss severities. In projecting taxable income for Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans during the year, management considers estimates of the amount of discount expected to be accreted. Such estimates require significant judgment and actual results may differ from these estimates. Moreover, the deductibility of realized losses from Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, and their effect on market discount accretion is analyzed on an asset-by-asset basis and while they will result in a reduction of taxable income, this reduction tends to occur gradually and primarily in periods after the realized losses are reported.\nResecuritization transactions result in differences between GAAP net income and REIT Taxable Income\nFor tax purposes, depending on the transaction structure, a resecuritization transaction may be treated either as a sale or a financing of the underlying MBS. Income recognized from resecuritization transactions will differ for tax and GAAP. For tax purposes, we own and may in the future acquire interests in resecuritization trusts, in which several of the classes of securities are or will be issued with Original Issue Discount (or OID). As the holder of the retained interests in the trust, we generally will be required to include OID in our current gross interest income over the term of the applicable securities as the OID accrues. The rate at which the OID is recognized into taxable income is calculated using a constant rate of yield to maturity, with realized losses impacting the amount of OID recognized in REIT taxable income once they are actually incurred. For tax purposes, REIT taxable income may be recognized in excess of economic income (i.e., OID) or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from these assets, thereby effecting our dividend distribution requirement to stockholders.\nRegulatory Developments\nThe U.S. Congress, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. Treasury, FDIC, SEC and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken and continue to consider additional actions in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulator, an independent bureau housed within the Federal Reserve System, and known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (or the CFPB). The CFPB has broad authority over a wide range of consumer financial products and services, including mortgage lending. One portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (or Mortgage Reform Act), contains new underwriting and servicing standards for the mortgage industry, as well as restrictions on compensation for mortgage originators. In addition, the Mortgage Reform Act grants broad discretionary regulatory authority to the CFPB to prohibit or condition terms, acts or practices relating to residential mortgage loans that the\nCFPB finds abusive, unfair, deceptive or predatory, as well as to take other actions that the CFPB finds are necessary or proper to ensure responsible affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers. The Dodd-Frank Act also affects the securitization of mortgages (and other assets) with requirements for risk retention by securitizers and requirements for regulating Rating Agencies.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that numerous regulations, many of which (including those mentioned above regarding underwriting and mortgage originator compensation) have only recently been implemented and operationalized. As a result, we are unable to fully predict at this time how the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws that may be adopted in the future, will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the environment for repurchase financing and other forms of borrowing, the investing environment for Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and/or residential mortgage loans, the securitization industry, Swaps and other derivatives. However, at a minimum, we believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder are likely to continue to increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage and securitization industries, including us.\nIn addition to the regulatory actions being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, on August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release under which it is reviewing interpretive issues related to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C) excludes from the definition of investment company\u201d entities that are primarily engaged in, among other things, purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.\u201d Many companies that engage in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments seek to rely on existing interpretations of the SEC Staff with respect to Section 3(c)(5)(C) so as not to be deemed an investment company for the purpose of regulation under the Investment Company Act. In connection with the concept release, the SEC requested comments on, among other things, whether it should reconsider its existing interpretation of Section 3(c)(5)(C). To date the SEC has not taken or otherwise announced any further action in connection with the concept release. (For additional discussion of the SEC's concept release and its potential impact on us, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nCongress may continue to consider legislation that would significantly reform the country's mortgage finance system, including, among other things, eliminating Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and replacing them with a single new MBS insurance agency. Many details remain unsettled, including the scope and costs of the agencies's guarantee and their affordable housing mission, some of which could be addressed even in the absence of large-scale reform. While the likelihood of enactment of major mortgage finance system reform in the short term remains uncertain, it is possible that the adoption of any such reforms could adversely affect the types of assets we can buy, the costs of these assets and our business operations. As the FHFA and both houses of Congress continue to consider various measures intended to dramatically restructure the U.S. housing finance system and the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we expect debate and discussion on the topic to continue throughout 2016.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nGeneral\nFor 2015, our net income available to our common stock and participating securities was $298.2 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted common share, relatively unchanged compared to net income available to common stock and participating securities for 2014 of $298.5 million, or $0.81 per basic and diluted common share.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance) vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nThe changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income\u201d and Interest Expense.\u201d\nFor 2015, our net interest spread and margin were 2.33% and 2.65%, respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 2.40% and 2.78%, respectively, for 2014. Our net interest income increased by $11.2 million, or 3.7%, to $315.2 million from $304.0 million for 2014. For 2015, net interest income on RPL/NPL MBS and CRT securities increased by approximately\n$60.3 million. Prior to January 1, 2015, the majority of these assets and associated repurchase agreement financings were reported as components of Linked Transactions with net income reported in Other Income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. This increase was partially offset by the $58.9 million decline in net interest income from Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS compared to 2014, primarily due to lower average balances of these MBS and associated Agency repurchase financings. In addition, net interest income for 2015 compared to 2014 was approximately $6.2 million higher due to higher investments in residential whole loans at carrying value and lower outstanding balances of securitized debt.\nThe net interest spread on our Agency MBS portfolio declined to 0.88% for 2015 compared to 1.08% for 2014. The net interest spread on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio increased to 4.80% for 2015 compared to 4.73% for 2014. The net interest spread on our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio was 2.01% for 2015 compared to 2.10% for 2014. In the comparable prior period, the majority of our RPL/NPL MBS were reported as Linked Transactions with net interest income reported in Other Income, net.\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\nThe following table sets forth certain information about the average balances of our assets and liabilities and their related yields and costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Average yields are derived by dividing interest income by the average amortized cost of the related assets, and average costs are derived by dividing interest expense by the daily average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. The yields and costs include premium amortization and purchase discount accretion which are considered adjustments to interest rates.\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

This change primarily reflects a $1.106 billion decrease in the average amortized cost of our Agency MBS portfolio to $5.282 billion for 2015 from $6.388 billion for 2014. In addition, the net yield on our Agency MBS decreased to 2.00% for 2015 from 2.23% for 2014. At the end of 2015, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2014, as a result of prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 18 basis points to 2.78% for 2015 from 2.96% for 2014. During 2015, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a 13.2% CPR and we recognized a $41.2 million of net premium\namortization compared to a CPR of 13.0% and $46.8 million of net premium amortization in 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had net purchase premiums on our Agency MBS of $172.0 million, or 3.8% of current par value, compared to net purchase premiums of $213.3 million, or 3.8% of par value at December 31, 2014.\nInterest income on our Non-Agency MBS (which includes Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) increased $47.2 million, or 14.9%, for 2015 to $363.6 million compared to $316.3 million for 2014. Non-Agency MBS interest income reflected the inclusion of MBS that, prior to January 1, 2015, were accounted for as components of Linked Transactions and income from such securities was reported in Other Income, net in prior periods. In addition, primarily due to the accounting change for Linked Transactions, the average amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS increased by $1.916 billion or 46.6%, to $6.024 billion for 2015, from $4.108 billion for 2014. Our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio yielded 7.62% for 2015 compared to 7.74% for 2014. The decrease in the yield on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS is primarily due to prepayments on higher yielding assets in the portfolio, partially offset by increases in accretable discount due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the current and prior year, that have occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio yielded 3.68% for 2015 compared to 3.69% for 2014. During 2015, we recognized net purchase discount accretion of $92.8 million on our Non-Agency MBS, compared to $103.4 million for 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had net purchase discounts of $1.096 billion, including Credit Reserve and previously recognized OTTI of $787.5 million, on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS, or 25.4% of par value. During 2015 we reallocated $41.1 million of purchased discount designated as Credit Reserve to accretable purchase discount.\nThe following table presents the components of the coupon yield and net yields earned on our Agency MBS, Legacy Non-Agency MBS and RPL/NPL MBS and weighted average CPR experienced for such MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Legacy Non-Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RPL/NPL MBS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nCPR (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nCPR (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nBond CPR (4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Reflects the annualized coupon interest income divided by the average amortized cost. The discounted purchase price on Legacy Non-Agency MBS causes the coupon yield to be higher than the pass-through coupon interest rate.\n(2) Reflects annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS.\n(3) 3 month average CPR weighted by positions as of the beginning of each month in the quarter.\n(4) All principal payments are considered to be prepayments for CPR purposes.\nInterest Expense\nOur interest expense for 2015 increased by $17.1 million, or 10.7% to $176.9 million, from $159.8 million for 2014. This increase primarily reflects an increase in our average borrowings to finance RPL/NPL MBS (primarily due to the reclassification of repurchase agreements previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions as discussed above), residential whole loans and CRT securities, and utilization of FHLB advances, which was partially offset by a decrease in our average repurchase agreement borrowings to finance Agency MBS, lower financing rates on Legacy Non-Agency MBS, and a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had repurchase agreement borrowings of $7.889 billion of which $3.050 billion was hedged with Swaps, FHLB advances of $1.500 billion and securitized debt of $22.1 million. At December 31, 2015, our Swaps designated in hedging relationships had a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.82% and extended 45 months on average with a maximum remaining term of approximately 92 months.\nThe effective interest rate paid on our borrowings decreased to 1.81% for 2015 from 1.84% for 2014. This decrease reflects the lower average balance of Agency repurchase agreements and securitized debt, the lower financing rates associated with our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio (including the allocation of Swap expense), partially offset by the increase in our average balance of repurchase agreements used to finance RPL/NPL MBS.\nPayments made and/or received on our Swaps are a component of our borrowing costs and accounted for interest expense of $53.8 million or 57 basis points, for 2015, compared to interest expense of $69.8 million, or 81 basis points, for 2014. The weighted average fixed-pay rate on our Swaps designated as hedges decreased to 1.86% for 2015 from 1.93% for 2014. The weighted average variable interest rate received on our Swaps increased to 0.19% for 2015 from 0.16% for 2014. During 2015, we did not enter into any new Swaps and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $710.2 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.96% amortize and/or expire.\nWe expect that our interest expense and funding costs for 2016 will be impacted by market interest rates, the amount of our borrowings and incremental hedging activity, existing and future interest rates on our hedging instruments and the extent to which we execute additional longer-term structured financing transactions. As a result of these variables, our borrowing costs cannot be predicted with any certainty. (See Notes 6, 8 and 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nOTTI\nDuring 2015 we recognized OTTI charges through earnings of $705,000 against certain of our Non-Agency MBS. These impairment charges reflected changes in our estimated cash flows for such securities based on an updated assessment of the estimated future performance of the underlying collateral, including the expected principal loss over the term of the securities and changes in the expected timing of receipt of cash flows. We did not recognize any OTTI charges through earnings against our Non-Agency MBS during 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had 336 Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $40.4 million, 59 RPL/NPL MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $19.3 million and 58 Legacy Non-Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $9.1 million. Impairments on Agency MBS in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 are considered temporary and not credit related. Unrealized losses on Non-Agency MBS for which no OTTI was recorded during the year are considered temporary based on an assessment of changes in the expected cash flows for such securities, which considers recent bond performance and expected future performance of the underlying collateral. Significant judgment is used both in our analysis of expected cash flows for our Legacy Non-Agency MBS and any determination of the credit component of OTTI. (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for more information regarding OTTI.)\nOther Income, net\nFor 2015, Other income, net, decreased by $3.6 million to $51.2 million from $54.8 million for 2014. Other income, net for 2015 primarily reflects $34.9 million of gross gains realized on the sale of $70.7 million Non-Agency MBS, a $17.7 million net gain recorded on residential whole loans held at fair value, and $1.8 million of net losses related to loans transferred to REO during the year. During 2014, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $123.9 million and realized gross gains of $37.5 million. In addition, the year ended 2014 included unrealized net gains and net interest income on Linked Transactions of $17.1 million, which included interest income of $24.4 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $8.0 million on borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $677,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. As previously mentioned, new accounting guidance effective on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting and as a result we did not have any Linked Transactions effective January 1, 2015 (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nOperating and Other Expense\nFor 2015, we had compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expense of $42.0 million, or 1.34% of average equity, compared to $40.7 million, or 1.26% of average equity, for 2014. Compensation and benefits expense increased $712,000 to $26.3 million for 2015, compared to $25.6 million for 2014, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with our wider residential asset strategy. Our other general and administrative expenses increased by $588,000 to $15.8 million for 2015 compared to $15.2 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher IT development and related costs, data analytics and pricing services related expenses and costs associated with our attaining FHLB membership, partially offset by lower professional services related costs.\nOperating and Other Expense during 2015 also includes $10.4 million of loan servicing and other related operating expenses related to our residential whole loan activities. These expenses increased compared to the prior year period by approximately $7.0 million, consistent with the overall growth in this asset class during 2015. The overall increase is primarily due to loan servicing\nand due diligence related expenses associated with acquisitions closed over the past year. Also included in this expense category is the impact of loan loss provisions and non-recoverable REO maintenance and other loan related expenses that are incurred in connection with our investments in this asset class.\nOperating and Other Expense for 2014 also included a $1.2 million accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income. No such expense was incurred in 2015.\nSelected Financial Ratios\nThe following table presents information regarding certain of our financial ratios at or for the dates presented:\nTable 89: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At or for the Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on\nAverage Total\nAssets (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on\nAverage Total\nStockholders'\nEquity (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Average\nStockholders'\nEquity to Total\nAverage Assets (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dividend\nPayout\nRatio (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Leverage Multiple (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Book Value\nper Share\nof Common\nStock (6)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.80\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.56\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7.47\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Reflects annualized net income available to common stock and participating securities divided by average total assets.

The increase in net income available to our common stock and participating securities, and the increase of this item on a per share basis primarily reflected an increase in unrealized net gains and net interest income from Linked Transactions, higher gains on sales of MBS partially offset by a reduction in net interest income. Yields on Agency MBS were lower for 2014 compared to 2013 and were impacted by lower coupon yields. Non-Agency MBS yields were higher compared to the prior year period due primarily to the impact of credit reserve releases. In addition, during 2013, we had $7.5 million of unrealized losses on forward contracts for the sale of Agency MBS securities on a generic pool, or to-be-announced basis (or TBA short positions), a $3.9 million write-off of issuance costs on the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and a $2.0 million charge related to the impairment of resecuritization related costs. None of these items re-occurred in 2014.\nNet Interest Income\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nThe changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income\u201d and Interest Expense.\u201d\nFor 2014, our net interest spread and margin were 2.40% and 2.78%, respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 2.32% and 2.70%, respectively, for 2013. Although our net interest spread and margin increased, our net interest income decreased by $14.9 million, or 4.7%, to $304.0 million from $318.9 million for 2013. This decrease primarily reflected the impact of the lower average balance of our MBS portfolio as measured by amortized cost, increased Non-Agency MBS borrowing costs (including the impact of allocated Swap expense), partially offset by higher yielding Non-Agency MBS due to improved credit performance, a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt and lower Agency MBS borrowing costs. It should be noted that our reported net interest income for 2014 and 2013 excluded the interest income on Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities and the interest expense on repurchase agreements financings that had been accounted for as Linked Transactions and for which the net interest income was reported in Other income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. For 2014, the net interest earned on our investments accounted for as Linked Transactions increased by approximately $13.5 million to $16.4 million compared to $2.9 million for 2013. The net interest spread on our Agency MBS portfolio declined slightly to 1.08% for 2014 compared to 1.09% for 2013. The net interest spread on our Non-Agency MBS portfolio increased to 4.70% for 2014 compared to 4.55% for 2013.\nThe following table presents certain quarterly information regarding our net interest

This change primarily reflected a $453.0 million decrease in the average amortized cost of our Agency MBS portfolio to $6.388 billion for 2014 from $6.841 billion for 2013 and a decrease in the net yield on our Agency MBS to 2.23% for 2014 from 2.28% for 2013. At the end of 2014, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2013, due to acquisition of assets in the marketplace at generally lower coupons and as a result of prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 17 basis points to 2.96% for 2014 from 3.13% for 2013. During 2014, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a 13.0% CPR and we recognized a $46.8 million of net premium amortization compared to a CPR of 17.9% and $57.9 million of net premium amortization in 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had net purchase premiums on our Agency MBS of $213.3 million, or 3.8% of current par value, compared to net purchase premiums of $226.8 million, or 3.6% of par value at December 31, 2013.\nInterest income on our Non-Agency MBS (which includes Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) decreased $10.4 million, or 3.2%, for 2014 to $316.3 million compared to $326.8 million for 2013, primarily due to the decrease in the amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS portfolio, partially offset by the increase in the net yield on our Non-Agency MBS portfolio. For 2014, the average amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS (excluding Non-Agency MBS reported as a component of Linked Transactions) decreased by $399.2 million or 8.9%, to $4.108 billion, from $4.508 billion for 2013. Our Non-Agency MBS portfolio yielded 7.70% for 2014 compared to 7.25% for 2013. The increase in the yield on our Non-Agency MBS was primarily due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the then current and prior year, that had occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. During 2014, we recognized net purchase discount accretion of $103.4 million on our Non-Agency MBS, compared to $73.2 million for 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had net purchase discounts of $1.300 billion, including Credit Reserve and previously recognized OTTI of $900.6 million, on our Non-Agency MBS, or 24.4% of par value. During 2014 we reallocated $95.0 million of purchased discount designated as Credit Reserve to accretable purchase discount.\nThe following table presents the components of the coupon yield and net yields earned on our Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS and weighted average CPR experienced for such MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total MBS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nCPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nCPR\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nCPR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.17\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.59\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.53\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.34\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.43\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.05\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.87\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.07\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.78\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Reflected the annualized coupon interest income divided by the average amortized cost.

This decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt, a decrease in our average borrowings to finance Agency MBS and the lower effective interest rate paid on borrowings to finance Agency MBS, which was partially offset by higher effective funding costs associated with Non-Agency MBS, including allocated Swap financing costs, and securitized debt.\nAt December 31, 2014, we had repurchase agreement borrowings of $8.267 billion of which $3.760 billion was hedged with Swaps, and securitized debt of $110.6 million. At December 31, 2014, our Swaps designated in hedging relationships had a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.85% and extended 47 months on average with a maximum remaining term of approximately 104 months.\nThe following table presents information about our securitized debt at December 31, 2014:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>At December 31, 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benchmark Interest Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Securitized Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Interest Rate\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>57,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.85\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted Average Coupon Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,574\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.31\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective interest rate paid on our borrowings increased to 1.84% for 2014 from 1.76% for 2013. This increase reflected additional higher cost financing (including the impact of allocated Swap expense) associated with our Non-Agency MBS portfolio partially offset by the lower average balance of securitized debt and Agency repurchase agreements. Payments made and/or received on our Swaps are a component of our borrowing costs and accounted for interest expense of $69.8 million or 81 basis points, for 2014, compared to interest expense of $59.0 million, or 63 basis points, for 2013. The weighted average fixed-pay rate on our Swaps decreased to 1.93% for 2014 from 2.08% for 2013. The weighted average variable interest rate received on our Swaps decreased to 0.16% for 2014 from 0.19% for 2013. During 2014, we entered into four new Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0 million, a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.95% with initial maturities ranging from five to seven years, and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $685.0 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 2.28% amortize and/or expire.\nThe following table presents our leverage multiples, as measured by debt-to-equity, at the dates presented:\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At the Period Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>GAAP\nLeverage\nMultiple (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Non-GAAP\nLeverage\nMultiple (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.1\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represented the sum of borrowings under repurchase agreements, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, and obligations to return securities obtained as collateral and Senior Notes divided by stockholders' equity.\n(2) The Non-GAAP Leverage Multiple reflected the sum of our borrowings under repurchase agreements, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, obligations to return securities obtained as collateral, Senior Notes and borrowings that were reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of Linked Transactions of $1.520 billion, $791.8 million, $387.5 million, $206.0 million, $102.7 million, $82.4 million, $33.2 million and $34.1 million at December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, March 31, 2014, December 31, 2013, September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013 respectively. We presented a Non-GAAP leverage multiple since repurchase agreement borrowings that were a component of Linked Transactions may not be linked in the future and, if no longer linked, would be reported as repurchase agreement borrowings, which would increase our leverage multiple. (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nOTTI\nDuring 2014 and 2013, we did not recognize any OTTI charges through earnings against our Non-Agency MBS. At December 31, 2014, we had 271 Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $33.6 million and 45 Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities with a gross unrealized loss of $5.8 million. Impairments on Agency MBS in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2014 are considered temporary and not credit related. Unrealized losses on Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities for which no OTTI was recorded during the year were considered temporary based on an assessment of changes in the expected cash flows for such securities, which considered recent bond performance and expected future performance of the underlying collateral. Significant judgment was used both in the Company's analysis of expected cash flows for its Legacy Non-Agency MBS and any determination of the credit component of OTTI. (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for more information regarding OTTI.)\nOther Income, net\nFor 2014, Other income, net, increased by $33.0 million to $54.8 million from $21.8 million for 2013. In 2014 Other income, net primarily reflected $37.5 million of net gains realized on the sale of certain Non-Agency MBS and unrealized net gains and net interest income of $17.1 million on our Linked Transactions. In addition, during 2014 we recorded net gains on residential whole loans held at fair value of $116,000, primarily reflecting changes in market value of the underlying loans since acquisition. During 2014, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $123.9 million, realizing gross gains of $37.5 million. During 2013, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $152.6 million, and realized gross gains of $25.8 million and sold U.S. Treasury securities for $422.2 million, realizing net losses of approximately $24,000. The unrealized net gains and net interest income from Linked Transactions of $17.1 million for 2014 included interest income of $24.4 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $8.0 million on the borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $677,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. The unrealized net gains and net interest income on Linked Transactions of $3.2 million for 2013 included interest income of $3.9 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $925,000 on borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $281,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. During 2014, certain of our Linked Transactions became unlinked, resulting in our recording Non-Agency MBS with a fair value of $86.4 million on our consolidated balance sheets. The $7.5 million of losses realized on TBA short positions for 2013 reflected losses on the sale of $350.0 million notional of TBA securities.\nOperating and Other Expense\nFor 2014, we had compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expense of $40.7 million, or 1.26% of average equity, compared to $33.7 million, or 1.03% of average equity, for 2013. The $5.3 million increase in our compensation and benefits expense to $25.6 million for 2014, compared to $20.3 million for 2013, primarily reflected increases in equity-based compensation expense, salary and bonus expense, and payroll taxes. Our other general and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million to $15.2 million for 2014 compared to $13.4 million for 2013. The increase was primarily comprised of increases in professional services, board of director expenses and the cost of data and analytical systems.\nDuring 2014, we recorded $3.4 million of other investment related operating expenses related to our residential whole loan activities. In addition, during 2014, an interest accrual of $1.2 million was recorded, reflecting an additional accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income. During 2013, we recorded an excise tax and interest accrual of $2.0 million reflecting an updated estimate of excise tax payable in respect of undistributed REIT taxable income for the 2012 tax year and an additional accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income and recorded $250,000 reflecting an estimate of excise tax payable in respect of undistributed REIT taxable income for the 2013 tax year. In addition, for 2013, we realized a $2.0 million charge related to the impairment of resecuritization related costs.\nSelected Financial Ratios\nThe following table presents information regarding certain of our financial ratios at or for the dates presented:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At or for the Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on\nAverage Total\nAssets (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Return on\nAverage Total\nStockholders'\nEquity (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Average\nStockholders'\nEquity to Total\nAverage Assets (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Dividend\nPayout\nRatio (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Book Value\nper Share\nof Common\nStock (5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.78\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.38\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.25\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.55\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>(6)\n</td> <td>7.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.35\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.20\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.92\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.05\n</td> <td>(7)\n</td> <td>8.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Reflected annualized net income available to common stock and participating securities divided by average total assets.\n(2) Reflected annualized net income divided by average total stockholders' equity.\n(3) Reflected total average stockholders' equity divided by total average assets.\n(4) Reflected dividends declared per share of common stock divided by earnings per share.\n(5) Reflected total stockholders' equity less the preferred stock liquidation preference divided by total shares of common stock outstanding.\n(6) Excluded the special common stock dividend declared on August 1, 2013.\n(7) Excluded the special common stock dividend declared on March 4, 2013.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. In addition, we consolidate the special purpose entities (or SPEs) created to facilitate the resecuritization transactions completed in prior years and the acquisition of residential whole loans. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the more significant of these to be as follows:\nClassifications of Investment Securities and Assessment for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments\nOur investments in securities are primarily comprised of Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS, as discussed and detailed in Notes 2(b) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of our MBS are designated as available-for-sale (or AFS) and, accordingly, are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings (except when an OTTI is recognized, as discussed below) and reported in AOCI, a component of Stockholders' Equity. We do not intend to hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes; however, if available-for-sale securities were classified as trading securities, there could be substantially greater volatility in our earnings.\nWhen the fair value of an AFS security is less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date, the security is considered impaired. We assess our impaired securities on at least a quarterly basis and designate such impairments as either temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary.\u201d If we intend to sell an impaired security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security before its anticipated recovery, then we must recognize an OTTI through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not expect to sell an other-than-temporarily impaired security, only the portion of the OTTI related to credit losses is recognized through charges to earnings with the remainder recognized through AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn making our assessments about OTTIs, we review and consider certain information relating to our financial position and the impaired securities, including the nature of such securities, the contractual collateral requirements impacting us and our investment and leverage strategies, as well as subjective information, including our current and targeted liquidity position, the credit quality and expected cash flows of the underlying assets collateralizing such securities, and current and anticipated market conditions. In determining the OTTI related to credit losses for securities that were purchased at significant discounts to par and/or are considered to be of less than high credit quality, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The determination as to whether an OTTI exists and, if so, the amount of credit impairment recognized in earnings is subjective, as such determinations are based on factual information available at the time of assessment as well as management's estimates of the future performance and cash flow projections. As a result, the timing and amount of OTTIs constitute material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.\nDuring 2015, we recognized credit-related OTTI losses through earnings related to our Non-Agency MBS of $705,000. At December 31, 2015, we did not intend to sell any MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, and it is more likely than not\u201d that we will not be required to sell these MBS before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at their maturity.\nGross unrealized losses on our Agency MBS were $40.4 million at December 31, 2015. Agency MBS are issued by GSEs and enjoy either the implicit or explicit backing of the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. While our Agency MBS are not rated by any rating agency, they are currently perceived by market participants to be of high credit quality, with risk of default limited to the unlikely event that the U.S. Government would not continue to support the GSEs. Given the credit quality inherent in Agency MBS, we do not consider any of the current impairments on our Agency MBS to be credit related. In assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell any impaired security before its anticipated recovery, which may be at its maturity, we consider for each impaired security, the significance of each investment, the amount of impairment, the projected future performance of such impaired securities, as well as our current and anticipated leverage capacity and liquidity position. Based on these analyses, we determined that at December 31, 2015 any unrealized losses on our Agency MBS were temporary.\nThe payments of principal and interest we receive on our Agency MBS, which depend directly upon payments on the mortgages underlying such securities, are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSEs, but their guarantees are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Ginnie Mae is part of a U.S. Government agency and its guarantees are explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. We believe that the stronger backing for the guarantors of Agency MBS resulting from the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has further strengthened their credit worthiness; however, there can be no assurance that these actions will be adequate for their needs. Accordingly, if these government actions are inadequate and the GSEs suffer losses in the future or cease to exist, our view of the credit worthiness of our Agency MBS could materially change, which may affect our assessment of OTTI for Agency MBS in future periods. (See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, The federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business.\u201d)\nUnrealized losses on our Non-Agency MBS (including Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) were $28.4 million, of which $19.3 million were RPL/NPL MBS and $9.1 million were Legacy Non-Agency MBS at December 31, 2015. Based upon the most recent evaluation, we do not consider these unrealized losses to be indicative of OTTI and do not believe\nthat these unrealized losses are credit related, but are rather a reflection of current market yields and/or market place bid-ask spreads. We have reviewed our Non-Agency MBS that are in an unrealized loss position to identify those securities with losses that are other-than-temporary based on an assessment of changes in expected cash flows for such securities, which considers recent bond performance, where possible, and expected future performance of the underlying collateral.\nOur expectations with respect to our securities in an unrealized loss position may change over time, given, among other things, the dynamic nature of markets and other variables. Future sales or changes in our expectations with respect to securities in an unrealized loss position could result in us recognizing OTTI charges or realizing losses on sales of MBS in the future. (See Notes 2(b) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nFair Value Measurements\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nThe following describes the valuation methodologies used for our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nSecurities Obtained and Pledged as Collateral/Obligation to Return Securities Obtained as Collateral\nThe fair value of U.S. Treasury securities obtained as collateral and the associated obligation to return securities obtained as collateral are based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity. Securities obtained as collateral are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nMBS and CRT Securities\nWe determine the fair value of our Agency MBS, based upon prices obtained from third-party pricing services, which are indicative of market activity and repurchase agreement counterparties.\nFor Agency MBS, the valuation methodology of our third-party pricing services incorporate commonly used market pricing methods, trading activity observed in the market place and other data inputs. The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: collateral vintage, coupon, maturity date, loan age, reset date, collateral type, periodic and life cap, geography, and prepayment speeds. Management analyzes pricing data received from third-party pricing services and compares it to other indications of fair value including data received from repurchase agreement counterparties and its own observations of trading activity observed in the market place.\nIn determining the fair value of our Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities, management considers a number of observable market data points, including prices obtained from pricing services and brokers as well as dialogue with market participants. In valuing Non-Agency MBS, we understand that pricing services use observable inputs that include, in addition to trading activity observed in the market place, loan delinquency data, credit enhancement levels and vintage, which are taken into account to assign pricing factors such as spread and prepayment assumptions. For tranches of Legacy Non-Agency MBS that are cross-collateralized, performance of all collateral groups involved in the tranche are considered. We collect and consider current market intelligence on all major markets, including benchmark security evaluations and bid-lists from various sources, when available.\nOur MBS and CRT securities are valued using various market data points as described above, which management considers directly or indirectly observable parameters. Accordingly, our MBS and CRT securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nResidential Whole Loans, at Fair Value\nWe determine the fair value of our residential whole loans held at fair value after considering portfolio valuations obtained from a third-party who specializes in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans and trading activity observed in the market place. The Company's residential whole loans held at fair value are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nSwaps\nWe determine the fair value of our non-centrally cleared Swaps considering valuations obtained from a third-party pricing service. For Swaps that are cleared by a central clearing house, valuations provided by the clearing house are used. All valuations obtained are tested with internally developed models that apply readily observable market parameters. We consider the creditworthiness of both us and our counterparties, along with collateral provisions contained in each derivative agreement, from the perspective of both us and our counterparties. All of our Swaps are subject either to bilateral collateral arrangements, or for cleared Swaps, to the clearing house's margin requirements. Consequently, no credit valuation adjustment was made in determining the fair value of such instruments. Our Swaps are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nInterest Income on our Non-Agency MBS\nInterest income on the Non-Agency MBS that were purchased at a discount to par value and/or are considered to be of less than high credit quality is recognized based on the security's effective interest rate which is the security's IRR. The IRR is determined using management's estimate of the projected cash flows for each security, which are based on our observation of current information and events and include assumptions related to fluctuations in interest rates, prepayment speeds and the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, we review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in the IRR/interest income recognized on these securities or in the recognition of OTTIs.\nBased on the projected cash flows for our Non-Agency MBS purchased at a discount to par value, a portion of the purchase discount may be designated as Credit Reserve, which effectively mitigates our risk of loss on the mortgages collateralizing such MBS and is not expected to be accreted into interest income. The amount designated as Credit Reserve may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security with a Credit Reserve is more favorable than forecasted, a portion of the amount designated as Credit Reserve may be reallocated to accretable discount and recognized into interest income over time. Conversely, if the performance of a security with a Credit Reserve is less favorable than forecasted, the amount designated as Credit Reserve may be increased, or impairment charges and write-downs of such securities to a new cost basis could result.\nResidential Whole Loans\nResidential whole loans included in our consolidated balance sheets are generally comprised of pools of fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans acquired through consolidated trusts in secondary market transactions at discounted purchase prices. The accounting model utilized by us is determined at the time each loan package is initially acquired and is generally based on the delinquency status of the majority of the underlying borrowers in the package at acquisition. The accounting model described below under Residential Whole Loans at Carrying Value\u201d is typically utilized by us for loans where the underlying borrower has a delinquency status of less than 60 days at the acquisition date. The accounting model described below under Residential Whole Loans at Fair Value\u201d is typically utilized by us for loans where the underlying borrower has a delinquency status of 60 days or more at the acquisition date. The accounting model initially applied is not subsequently changed.\nOur residential whole loans pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements are included in the consolidated balance sheets with the fair value of the loans pledged disclosed parenthetically. Purchases and sales of residential whole loans are recorded on the trade date, with amounts recorded reflecting management's current estimate of assets that will be acquired or disposed at the closing of the transaction. This estimate is subject to revision at the closing of the transaction, pending the outcome of due diligence performed prior to closing.\nResidential Whole Loans at Carrying Value\nNotwithstanding that majority of these loans are considered to be performing substantially in accordance with their current contractual terms and conditions, we have elected to account for these loans as credit impaired as they were acquired at discounted prices that reflect, in part, the impaired credit history of the borrower. Substantially all of the borrowers have previously experienced payment delinquencies and the amount owed on the mortgage loan may exceed the value of the property pledged as collateral. Consequently, we have assessed that these loans have a higher likelihood of default than newly originated mortgage loans with LTVs of 80% or less to credit worthy borrowers. We believe that amounts paid to acquire these loans represent fair market value at the date of acquisition. Such loans are initially recorded at fair value with no allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to acquisition, the recorded amount reflects the original investment amount, plus accretion of interest income, less principal and interest cash flows received. These loans are presented on our consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which reflects the recorded amount reduced by any allowance for loan losses established subsequent to acquisition.\nUnder the application of this accounting model we may aggregate into pools loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter that are assessed as having similar risk characteristics. For each pool established, or on an individual loans basis for loans not aggregated into pools, we estimate at acquisition and periodically on at least a quarterly basis, the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected. The difference between the cash flows expected to be collected and the carrying amount of the loans is referred to as the accretable yield.\u201d This amount is accreted as interest income over the life of the loans using an effective interest rate (level yield) methodology. Interest income recorded each period reflects the amount of accretable yield recognized and not the coupon interest payments received on the underlying loans. The difference between contractually required principal and interest payments and the cash flows expected to be collected, referred to as the non-accretable difference,\u201d and includes estimates of both the effect of prepayments and expected credit losses over the life of the underlying loans.\nA decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate impairment at the pool and/or individual loan level thus requiring the establishment of an allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition, adjusted for any increases due to changes in estimated cash flows that are subsequently no longer expected to be received at the relevant measurement date. A significant increase in expected cash flows in subsequent periods first reduces any previously recognized allowance for loan losses and then will result in a recalculation in the amount of accretable yield. The adjustment of accretable yield due to a significant increase in expected cash flows is accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate and results in reclassification from non-accretable difference to accretable yield.\nResidential Whole Loans at Fair Value\nCertain of our residential whole loans are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of a fair value election made at time of acquisition. Given the significant uncertainty associated with estimating the timing of and amount of cash flows associated with these loans that will be collected, and that the cash flows ultimately collected may be dependent on the value of the property securing the loan, we consider that accounting for these loans at fair value should result in a better reflection over time of the economic returns from these loans. We determine the fair value of our residential whole loans held at fair value after considering portfolio valuations obtained from a third-party who specializes in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans and trading activity observed in the market place. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings and presented in Net gain on residential whole loans held at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations.\nCash received reflecting coupon payments on residential whole loans held at fair value is not included in Interest Income, but rather is presented in Net gain on residential whole loans held at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations.\nHedging Activities\nWe may use a variety of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of our exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk and prepayment risk. The objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in net book value over a range of interest rate scenarios. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing during a period of rising interest rates. Our derivative instruments are currently comprised of Swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges against the interest rate risk associated with certain of our borrowings. Prior to 2015, our derivative financial instruments also included Linked Transactions, which were not designated as hedging instruments. New accounting guidance that was effective for us on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting. During 2013, we also entered into TBA short positions which were not designated as hedging instruments.\nOur Swaps designated as hedging transactions have the effect of modifying the repricing characteristics of our repurchase agreements and cash flows for such liabilities. Under each Swap, we agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable interest rate, generally based on one-month or three-month LIBOR, on the notional amount of the Swap. We document our risk-management policies, including objectives and strategies, as they relate to our hedging activities and the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged liability for all Swaps designated as hedging transactions. We assess, both at inception of a hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether or not the hedge relationship is highly effective.\u201d\nWe discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis and recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative through earnings when: (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows of a hedged item (including forecasted transactions); (ii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii) it is determined that designating the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate.\nSwaps are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, as assets, if their fair value is positive, or as liabilities, if their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of our Swaps designated in hedging transactions are recorded in OCI provided that the hedge remains effective. Changes in fair value for any ineffective amount of a Swap are recognized in earnings. We have not recognized any change in the value of our existing Swaps designated as hedges through earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness.\nDuring 2013, we entered into TBA short positions as a means of managing interest rate risk and MBS basis risk associated with our investment and financing activities. A TBA short position is a forward contract for sale of Agency MBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date. The specific Agency MBS that could be delivered into the contract upon the settlement date, published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or SIFMA), are not known at the time of the transaction.\nTBA short positions were accounted for as derivative instruments since we could not assert that it was probable at inception and throughout the term of the TBA contract that we would physically deliver the Agency security upon settlement of the contract. TBA short positions were presented as either derivative assets or liabilities, at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses associated with TBA short positions were reported in Other income, net on our consolidated statements of operations.\nAlthough permitted under certain circumstances, we do not offset cash collateral receivables or payables against our net derivative positions.\nIncome Taxes\nWe believe that we operate in, and intend to continue to operate in, a manner that allows and will continue to allow us to be taxed as a REIT. Provided that we distribute all of our REIT taxable income (including net long-term capital gains) to stockholders in the timeframe permitted by the Code, we do not generally expect to pay corporate level taxes and/or excise taxes. However, such taxes may arise from time to time in the normal course of our business. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. In addition, REIT taxable income calculated at the time our financial statements are prepared is based on certain estimates that may be revised as our tax return, which is not required to be filed until September in the following year, is completed. If we were to fail to meet certain of the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nIn addition, we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as a TRS. In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that we cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business. Generally, a TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. Since a portion of our business may be conducted through one or more TRS, our income earned by TRS may be subject to corporate income taxation. To maintain our REIT election, no more than 25% (or, for 2018 and subsequent taxable years, 20%) of the value of a REIT's assets at the end of each quarter may consist of stock or securities in a TRS. For purposes of the determination of U. S. federal and state income taxes, the Company's subsidiaries that elected to be treated as a TRS record current or deferred income taxes based on differences (both permanent and timing) between the determination of their taxable income and net income under GAAP. No deferred tax benefit was recorded by the Company in 2015 or 2014, as a valuation allowance for the full amount of the associated deferred tax asset was recognized as its recovery is not considered more likely than not.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe expense our equity-based compensation awards that are subject to vesting conditions, ratably over the vesting period of such awards, based upon the fair value of such awards at the grant date. Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recorded net of estimated forfeitures expected to occur over the vesting period. (See Notes 2(l) and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nDuring 2010, we granted certain RSUs that vested after either two or four years of service and provided that certain criteria were met, which were based on a formula that included changes in our closing stock price over a two- or four-year period and dividends declared on our common stock during those periods. From 2011 through 2013, we granted certain RSUs that vested annually over a one or three-year period, provided that certain criteria were met, which were based on a formula tied to our achievement of average total stockholder return during that three-year period. During 2014 and 2015, we made grants of RSUs certain of which cliff vest after a three-year period and certain of which cliff vest after a three-year period, subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria, based on a formula tied to our achievement of average total stockholder return during that three-year period. The features in these awards related to the attainment of total stockholder return over a specified period constitute a market condition\u201d which impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized for these awards. Specifically, the uncertainty regarding the achievement of the market condition was reflected in the grant date fair valuation of the RSUs, which in addition to estimates regarding the amount of RSUs expected to be forfeited during the associated service period, determined the amount of compensation expense recognized. The amount of compensation expense recognized was not dependent on whether the market condition was or will be achieved, while differences in actual forfeiture experience relative to estimated forfeitures results in adjustments to the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized.\nWe have awarded dividend equivalents that may be granted as a separate instrument or may be a right associated with the grant of another equity-based award. Compensation expense for separately awarded dividend equivalents is based on the grant date fair value of such awards and is recognized over the vesting period. Payments pursuant to these dividend equivalents are charged to Stockholders' Equity. Payments pursuant to dividend equivalents that are attached to equity-based awards are charged to Stockholders' Equity to the extent that the attached equity awards are expected to vest. Compensation expense is recognized for payments made for dividend equivalents to the extent that the attached equity awards do not or are not expected to vest and grantees are not required to return payments of dividends or dividend equivalents to the Company.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS\nFinancial Instruments - Overall - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (or ASU) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (or ASU 2016-01).The amendments in this ASU affect all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities, and address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The classification and measurement guidance of investments in debt securities and loans are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted for public business entities, except for a provision related to financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued, to recognize in other comprehensive income, the change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk measured using the fair value option. Entities should apply the amendments in this ASU by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nInterest - Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (or ASU 2015-03). The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt issued at a discount. The recognition and measurement guidance of debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued and entities should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a significant impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.\nConsolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (or ASU 2015-02). The amendments in this ASU change the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. At the effective date, all previous consolidation analyses that the guidance affects must be reconsidered. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this ASU using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. While we have not yet selected a transition method, we do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-2 to have a significant impact on our financial position.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (or ASU 2014-09). The ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 originally would have been effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. On April 29, 2015, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU 2014-09. On July 9, 2015 the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for all entities by one year. As a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. The FASB would also permit entities to adopt the standard early, but not before the original public entity effective date. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\nPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (or ASU 2014-15). The amendments in this ASU provide guidance in GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an entity's going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a significant impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur principal sources of cash generally consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements and other collateralized financings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio, cash generated from our operating results and, to the extent such transactions are entered into, proceeds from capital market and structured financing transactions. Our most significant uses of cash are generally to pay principal and interest on our financing transactions, to purchase MBS and residential whole loans, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, to fund our operations and to make other investments that we consider appropriate.\nWe seek to employ a diverse capital raising strategy under which we may issue capital stock and other types of securities. To the extent we raise additional funds through capital market transactions, we currently anticipate using the net proceeds from such transactions to acquire additional MBS and residential whole loans, consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which may include, among other things, the repayment of our financing transactions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have available for issuance\nan unlimited amount (subject to the terms and limitations of our charter) of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares representing preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, rights and/or units pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement and, at December 31, 2015, we had 6.8 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to our DRSPP shelf registration statement. During 2015, we issued 162,373 shares of common stock through our DRSPP, raising net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.\nOn April 15, 2013, we completed the issuance of 8.0 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, in an underwritten public offering. The aggregate net proceeds to us from the offering of the Series B Preferred Stock were approximately $193.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and related offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (as discussed below), and used the remaining net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to acquire additional MBS consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which included, among other things, the repayment of our repurchase agreements.\nOn May 16, 2013, we redeemed all 3,840,000 outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $97.0 million, or $25.27153 per share, including all accrued and unpaid dividends to the Redemption Date. The redemption value of the Series A Preferred Stock exceeded its carrying value by $3.9 million, which represents the original offering costs for the Series A Preferred Stock.\nOur borrowings under repurchase agreements are uncommitted and renewable at the discretion of our lenders and, as such, our lenders could determine to reduce or terminate our access to future borrowings at virtually any time. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements, as such terms relate to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities that are the subject of repurchase transactions, generally conform to the terms contained in the standard master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA or the global master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA and the International Capital Market Association. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions, which differ by lender, may include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts (as defined below), purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default and setoff provisions.\nWith respect to margin maintenance requirements for repurchase agreements with Non-Agency MBS as collateral, margin calls are typically determined by our counterparties based on their assessment of changes in the fair value of the underlying collateral and in accordance with the agreed upon haircuts specified in the transaction confirmation with the counterparty. We address margin call requests in accordance with the required terms specified in the applicable repurchase agreement and such requests are typically satisfied by posting additional cash or collateral on the same business day. We review margin calls made by counterparties and assess them for reasonableness by comparing the counterparty valuation against our valuation determination. When we believe that a margin call is unnecessary because our assessment of collateral value differs from the counterparty valuation, we typically hold discussions with the counterparty and are able to resolve the matter. In the unlikely event that resolution cannot be reached, we will look to resolve the dispute based on the remedies available to us under the terms of the repurchase agreement, which in some instances may include the engagement of a third party to review collateral valuations. For other agreements that do not include such provisions, we could resolve the matter by substituting collateral as permitted in accordance with the agreement or otherwise request the counterparty to return the collateral in exchange for cash to unwind the financing.\nThe following table presents information regarding the margin requirements, or the percentage amount by which the collateral value is contractually required to exceed the loan amount (this difference is referred to as the haircut\u201d), on our repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nHaircut\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreement borrowings secured by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.67\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy Non-Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RPL/NPL MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRT securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential whole loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>At December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nHaircut\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>High\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Repurchase agreement borrowings secured by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.79\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.00\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Legacy Non-Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RPL/NPL MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. Treasury securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CRT securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential whole loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe weighted average haircut requirements for the respective underlying collateral types for our repurchase agreements have not significantly changed since December 31, 2014, with the exception of Residential whole loans and Legacy Non-Agency MBS. During 2015, the Company has increased the number of counterparties providing repurchase agreement financing for residential whole loans resulting in a lower overall weighted average haircut. The decrease in the weighted average haircut for Legacy Non-Agency MBS results from the unwind during 2015 of certain re-securitization transactions and subsequent refinancing of the underlying MBS at lower haircut levels.\nDuring 2015, the financial market environment was impacted by continued accommodative monetary policy. Repurchase agreement funding for both Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS has been available to us at generally attractive market terms from multiple counterparties. Typically, due to the credit risk inherent to Non-Agency MBS, repurchase agreement funding involving Non-Agency MBS is available from fewer counterparties, at terms requiring higher collateralization and higher interest rates, than repurchase agreement funding secured by Agency MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. Therefore, we generally expect to be able to finance our acquisitions of Agency MBS on more favorable terms than financing for Non-Agency MBS.\nIn July 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MFA Insurance became a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, MFA Insurance had access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances (subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB). The weighted average haircut on our FHLB advances at December 31, 2015 was 7.00%. However, in January, 2016, the FHFA amended its regulation on FHLB membership, which, among other things, provided termination rules for current captive insurance members. As a result, MFA Insurance will not be permitted new advances or renewal of existing advances and will be required to terminate its FHLB membership and repay any outstanding advances by no later than February 19, 2017. As of December 31, 2015 and February 16, 2016, MFA Insurance had approximately $1.500 billion and $1.200 billion, respectively, in outstanding advances (backed by Agency MBS).\nWe maintain cash and cash equivalents, unpledged Agency and Non-Agency MBS and collateral in excess of margin requirements held by our counterparties (or collectively, cash and other unpledged collateral\u201d) to meet routine margin calls and protect against unforeseen reductions in our borrowing capabilities. Our ability to meet future margin calls will be impacted by our ability to use cash or obtain financing from unpledged collateral, which can vary based on the market value of such collateral, our cash position and margin requirements. Our cash position fluctuates based on the timing of our operating, investing and\nfinancing activities and is managed based on our anticipated cash needs.

operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of our MBS portfolio and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to decline; (iii) coupons on our ARM-MBS to reset, on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our MBS to decline, thereby slowing the amortization of our MBS purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; (ii) the value of our MBS portfolio and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to increase; (iii) coupons on our ARM-MBS to reset, on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our MBS to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our MBS purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to decrease. In addition, our borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by the type of collateral we pledge and general conditions in the credit market.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of the residential whole loans held by consolidated trusts at December 31, 2015 and does not reflect estimates of prepayments or scheduled amortization. For residential whole loans at carrying value, amounts presented are estimated based on the underlying loan contractual amounts.\nThe following table presents information regarding the margin requirements, or the percentage amount by which the collateral value is contractually required to exceed the loan amount (this difference is referred to as the haircut\u201d), on our repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nAt December 31, 2014, we had repurchase agreement borrowings of $8.267 billion of which $3.760 billion was hedged with Swaps, and securitized debt of $110.6 million. At December 31, 2014, our Swaps designated in hedging relationships had a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.85% and extended 47 months on average with a maximum remaining term of approximately 104 months.\nWe are a REIT primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in residential mortgage assets, including Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS, residential whole loans and CRT securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nThe following table presents our leverage multiples, as measured by debt-to-equity, at the dates presented:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total Interest-Earning Assets and Interest-\nBearing Liabilities\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Interest Spread (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Interest Margin (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.54\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn making our assessments about OTTIs, we review and consider certain information relating to our financial position and the impaired securities, including the nature of such securities, the contractual collateral requirements impacting us and our investment and leverage strategies, as well as subjective information, including our current and targeted liquidity position, the credit quality and expected cash flows of the underlying assets collateralizing such securities, and current and anticipated market conditions. In determining the OTTI related to credit losses for securities that were purchased at significant discounts to par and/or are considered to be of less than high credit quality, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The determination as to whether an OTTI exists and, if so, the amount of credit impairment recognized in earnings is subjective, as such determinations are based on factual information available at the time of assessment as well as management's estimates of the future performance and cash flow projections. As a result, the timing and amount of OTTIs constitute material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.\nOn April 15, 2013, we completed the issuance of 8.0 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, in an underwritten public offering. The aggregate net proceeds to us from the offering of the Series B Preferred Stock were approximately $193.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and related offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (as discussed below), and used the remaining net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to acquire additional MBS consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which included, among other things, the repayment of our repurchase agreements.\nOur MBS and CRT securities are valued using various market data points as described above, which management considers directly or indirectly observable parameters. Accordingly, our MBS and CRT securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Legacy Non-Agency MBS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>RPL/NPL MBS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Quarter Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nCPR (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nCPR (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Coupon\nYield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net\nYield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month Average\nBond CPR (4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.76\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.09\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.64\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.68\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.70\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.84\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.60\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.89\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.59\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.57\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.13\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.91\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.94\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.99\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.26\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.27\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.01\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.39\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents information with respect to our Non-Agency MBS at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.

Accordingly, on adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2015, we reclassified $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS and $4.6 million of CRT securities that had previously been reported as a component of Linked Transactions to Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities, respectively on our consolidated balance sheets. Non-Agency MBS at December 31, 2014 is presented: (i) excluding Linked Transactions and reported in accordance with GAAP; (ii) underlying our Linked Transactions and reflected consistent with GAAP

Under each Swap, we agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable interest rate, generally based on one-month or three-month LIBOR, on the notional amount of the Swap. We document our risk-management policies, including objectives and strategies, as they relate to our hedging activities and the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged liability for all Swaps designated as hedging transactions. We assess, both at inception of a hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether or not the hedge relationship is highly effective.\u201d\nThe effective interest rate paid on our borrowings increased to 1.84% for 2014 from 1.76% for 2013. This increase reflected additional higher cost financing (including the impact of allocated Swap expense) associated with our Non-Agency MBS portfolio partially offset by the lower average balance of securitized debt and Agency repurchase agreements. Payments made and/or received on our Swaps are a component of our borrowing costs and accounted for interest expense of $69.8 million or 81 basis points, for 2014, compared to interest expense of $59.0 million, or 63 basis points, for 2013. The weighted average fixed-pay rate on our Swaps decreased to 1.93% for 2014 from 2.08% for 2013. The weighted average variable interest rate received on our Swaps decreased to 0.16% for 2014 from 0.19% for 2013. During 2014, we entered into four new Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0 million, a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.95% with initial maturities ranging from five to seven years, and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $685.0 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 2.28% amortize and/or expire.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had approximately $895.1 million in residential whole loans acquired through our consolidated trusts, which represented approximately 6.8% of our total assets.

Also included in this expense category is the impact of loan loss provisions and non-recoverable REO maintenance and other loan related expenses that are incurred in connection with our investments in this asset class.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the more significant of these to be as follows:\nFor 2015, Other income, net, decreased by $3.6 million to $51.2 million from $54.8 million for 2014. Other income, net for 2015 primarily reflects $34.9 million of gross gains realized on the sale of $70.7 million Non-Agency MBS, a $17.7 million net gain recorded on residential whole loans held at fair value, and $1.8 million of net losses related to loans transferred to REO during the year. During 2014, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $123.9 million and realized gross gains of $37.5 million. In addition, the year ended 2014 included unrealized net gains and net interest income on Linked Transactions of $17.1 million, which included interest income of $24.4 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $8.0 million on borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $677,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. As previously mentioned, new accounting guidance effective on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting and as a result we did not have any Linked Transactions effective January 1, 2015 (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nRegulatory Developments\nDuring 2013, we entered into TBA short positions as a means of managing interest rate risk and MBS basis risk associated with our investment and financing activities. A TBA short position is a forward contract for sale of Agency MBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date. The specific Agency MBS that could be delivered into the contract upon the settlement date, published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or SIFMA), are not known at the time of the transaction.\nThe following table presents the components of the net interest spread earned on our Agency, Legacy Non-Agency MBS and RPL/NPL MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Coupon\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Current\nFace\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nPurchase\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nMarket\nPrice\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair\nValue (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nLoan Age\n(Months) (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Weighted\nAverage\nLoan Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Low Loan\nBalance\nand/or\nHARP (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 Month\nAverage\nCPR\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>15-Year Fixed Rate:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>969,213\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>102.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>990,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.04\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>420,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>438,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,706\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>575,040\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>616,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>99,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>106,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total 15-Year Fixed Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,075,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>104.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,164,730\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDecember 31, 2014\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (or ASU 2014-09). The ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 originally would have been effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. On April 29, 2015, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU 2014-09. On July 9, 2015 the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for all entities by one year. As a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. The FASB would also permit entities to adopt the standard early, but not before the original public entity effective date. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt issued at a discount. The recognition and measurement guidance of debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued and entities should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a significant impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (or ASU) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (or ASU 2016-01).The amendments in this ASU affect all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities, and address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The classification and measurement guidance of investments in debt securities and loans are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted for public business entities, except for a provision related to financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued, to recognize in other comprehensive income, the change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk measured using the fair value option. Entities should apply the amendments in this ASU by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td>

Non-Agency MBS interest income reflected the inclusion of MBS that, prior to January 1, 2015, were accounted for as components of Linked Transactions and income from such securities was reported in Other Income, net in prior periods. In addition, primarily due to the accounting change for Linked Transactions, the average amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS increased by $1.916 billion or 46.6%, to $6.024 billion for 2015, from $4.108 billion for 2014. Our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio yielded 7.62% for 2015 compared to 7.74% for 2014. The decrease in the yield on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS is primarily due to prepayments on higher yielding assets in the portfolio, partially offset by increases in accretable discount due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the current and prior year, that have occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio yielded 3.68% for 2015 compared to 3.69% for 2014. During 2015, we recognized net purchase discount accretion of $92.8 million on our Non-Agency MBS, compared to $103.4 million for 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had net purchase discounts of $1.096 billion, including Credit Reserve and previously recognized OTTI of $787.5 million, on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS, or 25.4% of par value. During 2015 we reallocated $41.1 million of purchased discount designated as Credit Reserve to accretable purchase discount.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In Thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(i) Non-Agency MBS (GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face/Par\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,961,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,319,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,420,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,755,432\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,861,843\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,020,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Discount Designated as Credit Reserve and OTTI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(787,541\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(1)\n</td> <td>(900,557\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Discount Designated as Accretable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(312,182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(399,564\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(ii) Non-Agency MBS Underlying Linked Transactions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face/Par\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,922,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,913,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,908,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Discount Designated as Credit Reserve\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,543\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Discount Designated as Accretable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,832\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(iii) Combined Non-Agency MBS and MBS Underlying Linked Transactions (Non-GAAP)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Face/Par\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,242,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,668,621\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortized Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,929,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Discount Designated as Credit Reserve and OTTI\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(916,100\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>(3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Discount Designated as Accretable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(397,732\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>461\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table presents certain information regarding the composition of our Agency MBS portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nDuring 2010, we granted certain RSUs that vested after either two or four years of service and provided that certain criteria were met, which were based on a formula that included changes in our closing stock price over a two- or four-year period and dividends declared on our common stock during those periods. From 2011 through 2013, we granted certain RSUs that vested annually over a one or three-year period, provided that certain criteria were met, which were based on a formula tied to our achievement of average total stockholder return during that three-year period. During 2014 and 2015, we made grants of RSUs certain of which cliff vest after a three-year period and certain of which cliff vest after a three-year period, subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria, based on a formula tied to our achievement of average total stockholder return during that three-year period. The features in these awards related to the attainment of total stockholder return over a specified period constitute a market condition\u201d which impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized for these awards. Specifically, the uncertainty regarding the achievement of the market condition was reflected in the grant date fair valuation of the RSUs, which in addition to estimates regarding the amount of RSUs expected to be forfeited during the associated service period, determined the amount of compensation expense recognized. The amount of compensation expense recognized was not dependent on whether the market condition was or will be achieved, while differences in actual forfeiture experience relative to estimated forfeitures results in adjustments to the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized.\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

At December 31, 2014, we had 271 Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $33.6 million and 45 Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities with a gross unrealized loss of $5.8 million. Impairments on Agency MBS in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2014 are considered temporary and not credit related. Unrealized losses on Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities for which no OTTI was recorded during the year were considered temporary based on an assessment of changes in the expected cash flows for such securities, which considered recent bond performance and expected future performance of the underlying collateral. Significant judgment was used both in the Company's analysis of expected cash flows for its Legacy Non-Agency MBS and any determination of the credit component of OTTI. (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for more information regarding OTTI.)\nThe following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates (yield/cost) and changes in the volume (average balance) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) the changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in average balance multiplied by prior rate); (ii) the changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior average balance); and (iii) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately, based on absolute values, to the changes due to rate and volume.\nTable 98: <table><tr><td>

portion of the purchase discount may be designated as Credit Reserve, which effectively mitigates our risk of loss on the mortgages collateralizing such MBS and is not expected to be accreted into interest income. The amount designated as Credit Reserve may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security with a Credit Reserve is more favorable than forecasted, a portion of the amount designated as Credit Reserve may be reallocated to accretable discount and recognized into interest income over time. Conversely, if the performance of a security with a Credit Reserve is less favorable than forecasted, the amount designated as Credit Reserve may be increased, or impairment charges and write-downs of such securities to a new cost basis could result.\nThe following table presents the changes in the components of purchase discount on Non-Agency MBS with respect to purchase discount designated as Credit Reserve and OTTI, and accretable purchase discount for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As previously discussed, new accounting guidance that was effective for us on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting and as a result we did not have any Linked Transactions effective January 1, 2015. The information presented for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes securities underlying Linked Transactions and is presented on both a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis (effective on such date):\n (2) The effective yield adjustment is the difference between the net yield, calculated utilizing management's estimates of timing and amount of future cash flows for Legacy Non-Agency MBS and RPL/NPL MBS, less the current coupon yield. \nThe following table presents the components of the coupon yield and net yields earned on our Agency MBS, Legacy Non-Agency MBS and RPL/NPL MBS and weighted average CPR experienced for such MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\n (2) Reflects annualized interest expense divided by average balance of repurchase agreements and other advances, including the cost of Swaps allocated based on the proportionate share of the overall estimated weighted average portfolio duration and securitized debt.

During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased through consolidated trusts residential whole loans of approximately $608.3 million, with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $770.5 million. At December 31, 2015, our total recorded investment in residential whole loans was $895.1 million. Of this amount, $271.8 million is presented as residential whole loans at carrying value and $623.3 million as residential whole loans at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $16.0 million of income on residential whole loans held at carrying value in Interest Income on our consolidated statement of operations, representing an effective yield of 6.63% (excluding servicing costs). In addition, we recorded net gains on residential whole loans held at fair value of $17.7 million in Other Income, net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor Agency MBS, the valuation methodology of our third-party pricing services incorporate commonly used market pricing methods, trading activity observed in the market place and other data inputs. The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: collateral vintage, coupon, maturity date, loan age, reset date, collateral type, periodic and life cap, geography, and prepayment speeds. Management analyzes pricing data received from third-party pricing services and compares it to other indications of fair value including data received from repurchase agreement counterparties and its own observations of trading activity observed in the market place.\n(4) Home Affordable Refinance Program (or HARP) MBS are backed by refinanced loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80% at origination.\n(1) Reflected the annualized coupon interest income divided by the average amortized cost. The discounted purchase price on Non-Agency MBS causes the coupon yield to be higher than the pass-through coupon interest rate. (Does not include MBS underlying our Linked Transactions. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable of $1.0 million and $542,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe net interest spread on our Agency MBS portfolio declined to 0.88% for 2015 compared to 1.08% for 2014. The net interest spread on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio increased to 4.80% for 2015 compared to 4.73% for 2014. The net interest spread on our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio was 2.01% for 2015 compared to 2.10% for 2014. In the comparable prior period, the majority of our RPL/NPL MBS were reported as Linked Transactions with net interest income reported in Other Income, net.\namortization compared to a CPR of 13.0% and $46.8 million of net premium amortization in 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had net purchase premiums on our Agency MBS of $172.0 million, or 3.8% of current par value, compared to net purchase premiums of $213.3 million, or 3.8% of par value at December 31, 2014.\nCertain of our residential whole loans are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of a fair value election made at time of acquisition. Given the significant uncertainty associated with estimating the timing of and amount of cash flows associated with these loans that will be collected, and that the cash flows ultimately collected may be dependent on the value of the property securing the loan, we consider that accounting for these loans at fair value should result in a better reflection over time of the economic returns from these loans. We determine the fair value of our residential whole loans held at fair value after considering portfolio valuations obtained from a third-party who specializes in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans and trading activity observed in the market place. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings and presented in Net gain on residential whole loans held at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations.\n(1) Reflects annualized net income available to common stock and participating securities divided by average total assets. The decrease for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of $1.918 billion of MBS previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions.\nOur investments in securities are primarily comprised of Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS, as discussed and detailed in Notes 2(b) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of our MBS are designated as available-for-sale (or AFS) and, accordingly, are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings (except when an OTTI is recognized, as discussed below) and reported in AOCI, a component of Stockholders' Equity. We do not intend to hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes; however, if available-for-sale securities were classified as trading securities, there could be substantially greater volatility in our earnings.\nDuring 2015, we recognized credit-related OTTI losses through earnings related to our Non-Agency MBS of $705,000. At December 31, 2015, we did not intend to sell any MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, and it is more likely than not\u201d that we will not be required to sell these MBS before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at their maturity.\n (2) Reflected annualized interest expense divided by average balance of repurchase agreements, including the cost of Swaps allocated based on the proportionate share of the overall estimated weighted average portfolio duration, and securitized debt. Agency cost of funding included 79, 82, 81, 85, 86 and 74 basis points and Non-Agency cost of funding included 84, 89, 88, 74, 72 and 57 basis points associated with Swaps to hedge interest rate sensitivity on these assets for the quarters ended December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, March 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2013, respectively. Agency cost of funding includes 100 and 88 basis points associated with Swaps to hedge interest rate sensitivity on these assets for the quarters ended June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013, respectively. Non-Agency funding cost did not include any costs associated with Swaps in those periods. \nIn assessing the performance of our Non-Agency MBS portfolio prior to January 1, 2015, we did not view these transactions as linked, but rather viewed the performance of the underlying Non-Agency MBS and the related repurchase agreement borrowings as we would any other Non-Agency MBS that was not part of a linked transaction. Accordingly, as Linked Transaction accounting was discontinued on January 1, 2015, we consider that the Non-GAAP information disclosed in the above table for prior periods provides appropriate comparability to current period disclosures for our Non-Agency MBS portfolio.\nCPR levels are impacted by, among other things, conditions in the housing market, new regulations, government and private sector initiatives, interest rates, availability of credit to home borrowers, underwriting standards and the economy in general. In particular, CPR reflects the conditional repayment rate (or CRR), which measures voluntary prepayments of mortgages collateralizing a particular MBS, and the conditional default rate (or CDR), which measures involuntary prepayments resulting from defaults. CPRs on Agency MBS and Legacy Non-Agency MBS may differ significantly. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a weighted average CPR of 13.2%, and our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio experienced a CPR of 14.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a weighted average CPR of 13.0%, and our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio (including Legacy Non-Agency MBS underlying our Linked Transactions) experienced a CPR of 12.3%. Over the last consecutive eight quarters, ending with December 31, 2015, the monthly fair value weighted average CPR on our Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolios ranged from a high of 16.7% experienced during the month ended July 31, 2015 to a low of 10.4%, experienced during each of the months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, with an average CPR over such quarters of 13.1%.\nCurrent period estimated taxable and items expected to impact future taxable income\nWe believe that our $787.5 million Credit Reserve and OTTI appropriately factors in remaining uncertainties regarding underlying mortgage performance and the potential impact on future cash flows for our existing Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Home price appreciation and underlying mortgage loan amortization have decreased the LTV for many of the mortgages underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Home price appreciation during the past few years has generally been driven by a combination of limited housing supply, low mortgage rates, capital flows into own-to-rent foreclosure purchases and demographic-driven U.S. household formation. We estimate that the average LTV of mortgage loans underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS has declined from approximately 105% as of January 2012 to approximately 71% as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we estimate that the percentage of non-delinquent loans underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS that are underwater (with LTVs greater than 100%), has declined from approximately 52% as of January 2012 to 7% at December 31, 2015. Lower LTVs lessen the likelihood of defaults and simultaneously decrease loss severities. Further, during 2014 and 2015, we have also observed faster voluntary prepayment (i.e. prepayment of loans in full with no loss) speeds than originally projected. The yields on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS that were purchased at a discount are generally positively impacted if prepayment rates on these securities exceed our prepayment assumptions. Based on these current conditions, we have reduced estimated future losses within our Legacy Non-Agency portfolio. As a result, during the year ended 2015, $41.1 million was transferred from Credit Reserve to accretable discount. This increase in accretable discount is expected to increase the interest income realized over the remaining life of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS. The remaining average contractual life of such assets is approximately 20 years, but based on scheduled loan amortization and prepayments (both voluntary and involuntary), loan balances will decline substantially over time. Consequently, we believe that the majority of the impact on interest income from the reduction in Credit Reserve will occur over the next ten years.\n\nThe following table presents the components of the coupon yield and net yields earned on our Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS and weighted average CPR experienced for such MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nAgency MBS\n(3) Low Loan Balance represents MBS collateralized by mortgages with an original loan balance less than or equal to $175,000. HARP MBS are backed by refinanced loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80% at origination.\nSwaps are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, as assets, if their fair value is positive, or as liabilities, if their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of our Swaps designated in hedging transactions are recorded in OCI provided that the hedge remains effective. Changes in fair value for any ineffective amount of a Swap are recognized in earnings. We have not recognized any change in the value of our existing Swaps designated as hedges through earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness.\nNotwithstanding that majority of these loans are considered to be performing substantially in accordance with their current contractual terms and conditions, we have elected to account for these loans as credit impaired as they were acquired at discounted prices that reflect, in part, the impaired credit history of the borrower. Substantially all of the borrowers have previously experienced payment delinquencies and the amount owed on the mortgage loan may exceed the value of the property pledged as collateral. Consequently, we have assessed that these loans have a higher likelihood of default than newly originated mortgage loans with LTVs of 80% or less to credit worthy borrowers. We believe that amounts paid to acquire these loans represent fair market value at the date of acquisition. Such loans are initially recorded at fair value with no allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to acquisition, the recorded amount reflects the original investment amount, plus accretion of interest income, less principal and interest cash flows received. These loans are presented on our consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which reflects the recorded amount reduced by any allowance for loan losses established subsequent to acquisition.\n(1) Represented the sum of borrowings under repurchase agreements, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, and obligations to return securities obtained as collateral and Senior Notes divided by stockholders' equity.\nWe determine the fair value of our non-centrally cleared Swaps considering valuations obtained from a third-party pricing service. For Swaps that are cleared by a central clearing house, valuations provided by the clearing house are used. All valuations obtained are tested with internally developed models that apply readily observable market parameters. We consider the creditworthiness of both us and our counterparties, along with collateral provisions contained in each derivative agreement, from the perspective of both us and our counterparties. All of our Swaps are subject either to bilateral collateral arrangements, or for cleared Swaps, to the clearing house's margin requirements. Consequently, no credit valuation adjustment was made in determining the fair value of such instruments. Our Swaps are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n(1) Includes discount designated as Credit Reserve of $766.0 million and OTTI of $21.5 million.\nCFPB finds abusive, unfair, deceptive or predatory, as well as to take other actions that the CFPB finds are necessary or proper to ensure responsible affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers. The Dodd-Frank Act also affects the securitization of mortgages (and other assets) with requirements for risk retention by securitizers and requirements for regulating Rating Agencies.\nInterest income on our Agency MBS for 2015 decreased by $36.7 million, or 25.8% to $105.8 million from $142.5 million for 2014. This change primarily reflects a $1.106 billion decrease in the average amortized cost of our Agency MBS portfolio to $5.282 billion for 2015 from $6.388 billion for 2014. In addition, the net yield on our Agency MBS decreased to 2.00% for 2015 from 2.23% for 2014. At the end of 2015, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2014, as a result of prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 18 basis points to 2.78% for 2015 from 2.96% for 2014. During 2015, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a 13.2% CPR and we recognized a $41.2 million of net premium\n (2) Includes European-based counterparties as well as U.S.-domiciled subsidiaries of the European parent entity. \nDecember 31, 2014\n\nNew accounting guidance that was effective at the beginning of the year prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting. Accordingly, on adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2015, we reclassified $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS and $4.6 million of CRT securities that were previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions to Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities respectively on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, liabilities of $1.520 billion that were previously presented as a component of Linked Transactions were reclassified to Repurchase agreements on the consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, an amount of $4.5 million representing net unrealized gains on securities previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions as of December 31, 2014 was reclassified from Accumulated deficit to AOCI (See Notes 2(t) and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nFor 2014, we had net income available to our common stock and participating securities of $298.5 million, or $0.81 per basic and diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stock and participating securities of $285.0 million, or $0.78 per basic and diluted common share, for 2013. The increase in net income available to our common stock and participating securities, and the increase of this item on a per share basis primarily reflected an increase in unrealized net gains and net interest income from Linked Transactions, higher gains on sales of MBS partially offset by a reduction in net interest income. Yields on Agency MBS were lower for 2014 compared to 2013 and were impacted by lower coupon yields. Non-Agency MBS yields were higher compared to the prior year period due primarily to the impact of credit reserve releases. In addition, during 2013, we had $7.5 million of unrealized losses on forward contracts for the sale of Agency MBS securities on a generic pool, or to-be-announced basis (or TBA short positions), a $3.9 million write-off of issuance costs on the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and a $2.0 million charge related to the impairment of resecuritization related costs. None of these items re-occurred in 2014.\nOur total Non-Agency MBS portfolio for tax differs from our portfolio reported for GAAP primarily due to the fact that for tax purposes; (i) certain of the MBS contributed to the variable interest entities (or VIEs) used to facilitate resecuritization transactions were deemed to be sold; and (ii) the tax portfolio includes certain securities issued by these VIEs. In addition, for our Non-Agency MBS tax portfolio, potential timing differences arise with respect to the accretion of market discount into income and recognition of realized losses for tax purposes as compared to GAAP. Consequently, our REIT taxable income calculated in a given period may differ significantly from our GAAP net income.\n\n\n(5) MBS issued in June 2009 or later. Majority of underlying loans are ineligible to refinance through the HARP program.\n(2) Weighted average is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe information presented as of December 31, 2014 in the above tables on pages 42-43, includes certain underlying Non-Agency MBS and the associated repurchase agreement borrowings that were disclosed both separately and/or on a combined basis with our Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Prior to January 1, 2015, for GAAP financial reporting purposes, we were required to account for these items as Linked Transactions. Consequently, the presentation of this information in the above tables constitutes Non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, as promulgated by the SEC.\n(4) Reflected dividends declared per share of common stock divided by earnings per share.\nan unlimited amount (subject to the terms and limitations of our charter) of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares representing preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, rights and/or units pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement and, at December 31, 2015, we had 6.8 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to our DRSPP shelf registration statement. During 2015, we issued 162,373 shares of common stock through our DRSPP, raising net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.\nWe may use a variety of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of our exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk and prepayment risk. The objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in net book value over a range of interest rate scenarios. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing during a period of rising interest rates. Our derivative instruments are currently comprised of Swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges against the interest rate risk associated with certain of our borrowings. Prior to 2015, our derivative financial instruments also included Linked Transactions, which were not designated as hedging instruments. New accounting guidance that was effective for us on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting. During 2013, we also entered into TBA short positions which were not designated as hedging instruments.\nOur method of accounting for Non-Agency MBS purchased at significant discounts to par value, requires us to make assumptions with respect to each security. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, future interest rates, voluntary prepayment rates, default rates, mortgage modifications and loss severities. As part of our Non-Agency MBS surveillance process, we track and compare each security's actual performance over time to the performance expected at the time of purchase or, if we have modified our original purchase assumptions, to our revised performance expectations. To the extent that actual performance or our expectation of future performance of our Non-Agency MBS deviates materially from our expected performance parameters, we may revise our performance expectations, such that the amount of purchase discount designated as credit discount may be increased or decreased over time. Nevertheless, credit losses greater than those anticipated or in excess of the recorded purchase discount could occur, which could materially adversely impact our operating results.\n\n$60.3 million. Prior to January 1, 2015, the majority of these assets and associated repurchase agreement financings were reported as components of Linked Transactions with net income reported in Other Income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. This increase was partially offset by the $58.9 million decline in net interest income from Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS compared to 2014, primarily due to lower average balances of these MBS and associated Agency repurchase financings. In addition, net interest income for 2015 compared to 2014 was approximately $6.2 million higher due to higher investments in residential whole loans at carrying value and lower outstanding balances of securitized debt.\nIn determining the fair value of our Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities, management considers a number of observable market data points, including prices obtained from pricing services and brokers as well as dialogue with market participants. In valuing Non-Agency MBS, we understand that pricing services use observable inputs that include, in addition to trading activity observed in the market place, loan delinquency data, credit enhancement levels and vintage, which are taken into account to assign pricing factors such as spread and prepayment assumptions. For tranches of Legacy Non-Agency MBS that are cross-collateralized, performance of all collateral groups involved in the tranche are considered. We collect and consider current market intelligence on all major markets, including benchmark security evaluations and bid-lists from various sources, when available.\nWe seek to employ a diverse capital raising strategy under which we may issue capital stock and other types of securities. To the extent we raise additional funds through capital market transactions, we currently anticipate using the net proceeds from such transactions to acquire additional MBS and residential whole loans, consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which may include, among other things, the repayment of our financing transactions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have available for issuance\nInformation is not presented for residential whole loans at carrying value as income is recognized based on pools of assets with similar risk characteristics using an estimated yield based on cash flows expected to be collected over the lives of the loans in such pools rather than on the contractual coupons of the underlying loans.\nDecember 31, 2014\n(2) Reflected annualized net income divided by average total stockholders' equity.\n(7) Excluded the special common stock dividend declared on March 4, 2013.\n (1) Reflected annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS. \n\n(2) Weighted average is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we have access to various sources of liquidity which we estimate to be in excess of $571.0 million. This amount includes (i) $165.0 million of cash and cash equivalents; (ii) $241.7 million in estimated financing available from unpledged Agency MBS and from other Agency MBS collateral that is currently pledged in excess of contractual requirements; and (iii) $164.3 million in estimated financing available from unpledged Non-Agency MBS. Consequently, we believe that we are positioned to continue to take advantage of investment opportunities within the residential mortgage marketplace. In 2016, we intend to continue to selectively acquire MBS and residential whole loans. In addition, while the majority of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS will not return their full face value due to loan defaults, we believe that they will deliver attractive loss adjusted yields due to our discounted average amortized cost of 75% of face value at December 31, 2015.\nOur interest expense for 2015 increased by $17.1 million, or 10.7% to $176.9 million, from $159.8 million for 2014. This increase primarily reflects an increase in our average borrowings to finance RPL/NPL MBS (primarily due to the reclassification of repurchase agreements previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions as discussed above), residential whole loans and CRT securities, and utilization of FHLB advances, which was partially offset by a decrease in our average repurchase agreement borrowings to finance Agency MBS, lower financing rates on Legacy Non-Agency MBS, and a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt.\nOur book value per common share was $7.47 as of December 31, 2015. Book value per common share decreased from $8.12 as of December 31, 2014 due primarily to the impact of realized gains on sales and discount accretion income on Legacy Non-Agency MBS that was recognized and paid as dividends during the year, the change in the value of our Swaps, and lower unrealized gains on our Agency MBS and Legacy Non-Agency MBS, resulting from lower asset values.\nPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern\n (3) Reflected the difference between the net yield on average MBS and average cost of funds on MBS. \nDuring 2014, we recorded $3.4 million of other investment related operating expenses related to our residential whole loan activities. In addition, during 2014, an interest accrual of $1.2 million was recorded, reflecting an additional accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income. During 2013, we recorded an excise tax and interest accrual of $2.0 million reflecting an updated estimate of excise tax payable in respect of undistributed REIT taxable income for the 2012 tax year and an additional accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income and recorded $250,000 reflecting an estimate of excise tax payable in respect of undistributed REIT taxable income for the 2013 tax year. In addition, for 2013, we realized a $2.0 million charge related to the impairment of resecuritization related costs.\nthat these unrealized losses are credit related, but are rather a reflection of current market yields and/or market place bid-ask spreads. We have reviewed our Non-Agency MBS that are in an unrealized loss position to identify those securities with losses that are other-than-temporary based on an assessment of changes in expected cash flows for such securities, which considers recent bond performance, where possible, and expected future performance of the underlying collateral.\nAlthough permitted under certain circumstances, we do not offset cash collateral receivables or payables against our net derivative positions.\nInterest income on our Agency MBS for 2014 decreased by $13.5 million, or 8.7% to $142.5 million from $156.0 million for 2013. This change primarily reflected a $453.0 million decrease in the average amortized cost of our Agency MBS portfolio to $6.388 billion for 2014 from $6.841 billion for 2013 and a decrease in the net yield on our Agency MBS to 2.23% for 2014 from 2.28% for 2013. At the end of 2014, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2013, due to acquisition of assets in the marketplace at generally lower coupons and as a result of prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 17 basis points to 2.96% for 2014 from 3.13% for 2013. During 2014, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a 13.0% CPR and we recognized a $46.8 million of net premium amortization compared to a CPR of 17.9% and $57.9 million of net premium amortization in 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had net purchase premiums on our Agency MBS of $213.3 million, or 3.8% of current par value, compared to net purchase premiums of $226.8 million, or 3.6% of par value at December 31, 2013.\n\nASSET ALLOCATION \n (4) Represents the sum of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and securitized debt as a multiple of net equity allocated. The numerator of our Total Debt/Net Equity ratio also includes the obligation to return securities obtained as collateral of $507.4 million, and Senior Notes. \n (1) Excludes residential whole loans held at fair value which are reported as a component of non-interest-earning assets. \nSelected Financial Ratios\nPayments made and/or received on our Swaps are a component of our borrowing costs and accounted for interest expense of $53.8 million or 57 basis points, for 2015, compared to interest expense of $69.8 million, or 81 basis points, for 2014. The weighted average fixed-pay rate on our Swaps designated as hedges decreased to 1.86% for 2015 from 1.93% for 2014. The weighted average variable interest rate received on our Swaps increased to 0.19% for 2015 from 0.16% for 2014. During 2015, we did not enter into any new Swaps and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $710.2 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.96% amortize and/or expire.\nThe payments of principal and interest we receive on our Agency MBS, which depend directly upon payments on the mortgages underlying such securities, are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSEs, but their guarantees are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Ginnie Mae is part of a U.S. Government agency and its guarantees are explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. We believe that the stronger backing for the guarantors of Agency MBS resulting from the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has further strengthened their credit worthiness; however, there can be no assurance that these actions will be adequate for their needs. Accordingly, if these government actions are inadequate and the GSEs suffer losses in the future or cease to exist, our view of the credit worthiness of our Agency MBS could materially change, which may affect our assessment of OTTI for Agency MBS in future periods. (See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, The federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business.\u201d)\n(2) Weighted average is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of the net interest spread earned on our Agency and Non-Agency MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nOperating and Other Expense during 2015 also includes $10.4 million of loan servicing and other related operating expenses related to our residential whole loan activities. These expenses increased compared to the prior year period by approximately $7.0 million, consistent with the overall growth in this asset class during 2015. The overall increase is primarily due to loan servicing\n\nThe following table presents information regarding certain of our financial ratios at or for the dates presented:\nIn addition, we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as a TRS. In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that we cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business. Generally, a TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. Since a portion of our business may be conducted through one or more TRS, our income earned by TRS may be subject to corporate income taxation. To maintain our REIT election, no more than 25% (or, for 2018 and subsequent taxable years, 20%) of the value of a REIT's assets at the end of each quarter may consist of stock or securities in a TRS. For purposes of the determination of U. S. federal and state income taxes, the Company's subsidiaries that elected to be treated as a TRS record current or deferred income taxes based on differences (both permanent and timing) between the determination of their taxable income and net income under GAAP. No deferred tax benefit was recorded by the Company in 2015 or 2014, as a valuation allowance for the full amount of the associated deferred tax asset was recognized as its recovery is not considered more likely than not.\nUnder the application of this accounting model we may aggregate into pools loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter that are assessed as having similar risk characteristics. For each pool established, or on an individual loans basis for loans not aggregated into pools, we estimate at acquisition and periodically on at least a quarterly basis, the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected. The difference between the cash flows expected to be collected and the carrying amount of the loans is referred to as the accretable yield.\u201d This amount is accreted as interest income over the life of the loans using an effective interest rate (level yield) methodology. Interest income recorded each period reflects the amount of accretable yield recognized and not the coupon interest payments received on the underlying loans. The difference between contractually required principal and interest payments and the cash flows expected to be collected, referred to as the non-accretable difference,\u201d and includes estimates of both the effect of prepayments and expected credit losses over the life of the underlying loans.\nAt December 31, 2015, our CRT securities had an amortized cost of $186.3 million, a fair value of $183.6 million, a weighted average yield of 5.09% and weighted average time to maturity of 9.0 years.\nWe rely primarily on borrowings under repurchase agreements to finance our Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS. Our MBS have longer-term contractual maturities than our borrowings under repurchase agreements. Even though the majority of our MBS have interest rates that adjust over time based on short-term changes in corresponding interest rate indices (typically following an initial fixed-rate period for our Hybrids), the interest rates we pay on our borrowings will typically change at a faster pace than the interest rates we earn on our MBS. In order to reduce this interest rate risk exposure, we may enter into derivative instruments, which at December 31, 2015 were comprised of Swaps.\nCash received reflecting coupon payments on residential whole loans held at fair value is not included in Interest Income, but rather is presented in Net gain on residential whole loans held at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations.\n(1) We did not have any MBS with contractual maturities of less than one year at December 31, 2015.\nUnrealized losses on our Non-Agency MBS (including Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) were $28.4 million, of which $19.3 million were RPL/NPL MBS and $9.1 million were Legacy Non-Agency MBS at December 31, 2015. Based upon the most recent evaluation, we do not consider these unrealized losses to be indicative of OTTI and do not believe\n(6) Reflects total stockholders' equity less the preferred stock liquidation preference divided by total shares of common stock outstanding.\nThe determination of taxable income attributable to Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans is dependent on a number of factors, including principal payments, defaults, loss mitigation efforts and loss severities. In projecting taxable income for Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans during the year, management considers estimates of the amount of discount expected to be accreted. Such estimates require significant judgment and actual results may differ from these estimates. Moreover, the deductibility of realized losses from Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, and their effect on market discount accretion is analyzed on an asset-by-asset basis and while they will result in a reduction of taxable income, this reduction tends to occur gradually and primarily in periods after the realized losses are reported.\nIncome Taxes\nInterest income on the Non-Agency MBS that were purchased at a discount to par value and/or are considered to be of less than high credit quality is recognized based on the security's effective interest rate which is the security's IRR. The IRR is determined using management's estimate of the projected cash flows for each security, which are based on our observation of current information and events and include assumptions related to fluctuations in interest rates, prepayment speeds and the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, we review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in the IRR/interest income recognized on these securities or in the recognition of OTTIs.\nThe following table presents certain quarterly information regarding our net interest spread and net interest margin for the quarterly periods presented:\n(6) Agency 3/1, 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 Hybrid ARM-MBS with coupon greater than or equal to 4.5%.\nOther Income, net\nThe changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income\u201d and Interest Expense.\u201d\nMBS and CRT Securities\nInterest - Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\n (1) Represents for each counterparty the amount of cash and/or securities pledged as collateral less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and other advances, Swaps at fair value, and net interest receivable/payable on all such instruments. \n(6) MBS issued before June 2009.\nOTTI\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately $7.449 billion, or 66.7%, of our MBS portfolio was in its contractual fixed-rate period or were fixed-rate MBS and approximately $3.723 billion, or 33.3%, was in its contractual adjustable-rate period, or were floating rate MBS with interest rates that reset monthly. Our ARM-MBS in their contractual adjustable-rate period primarily include MBS collateralized by Hybrids for which the initial fixed-rate period has elapsed, such that the interest rate will typically adjust on an annual or semiannual basis.\n (2) Excludes residential whole loans held at fair value that are reported as a component of total non-interest-earning assets. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that numerous regulations, many of which (including those mentioned above regarding underwriting and mortgage originator compensation) have only recently been implemented and operationalized. As a result, we are unable to fully predict at this time how the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws that may be adopted in the future, will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the environment for repurchase financing and other forms of borrowing, the investing environment for Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and/or residential mortgage loans, the securitization industry, Swaps and other derivatives. However, at a minimum, we believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder are likely to continue to increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage and securitization industries, including us.\nThe following table presents at December 31, 2015, the dollar amount of our residential whole loans at fair value, contractually maturing after one year, and indicates whether the loans have fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates:\n\n (5) Includes $500.0 million of repurchase agreements entered into in connection with contemporaneous repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with a single counterparty \nGENERAL\n(2) Reflects annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS.\nPremiums arise when we acquire MBS at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such MBS (i.e., par value). Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire MBS at a price below the principal balance of the mortgages securing such MBS or acquire residential whole loans at a price below the principal balance of the mortgage. Premiums paid on our MBS are amortized against interest income and accretable purchase discounts on these investments are accreted to interest income. Purchase premiums on our MBS, which are primarily carried on our Agency MBS, are amortized against interest income over the life of each security using the effective yield method, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. An increase in the prepayment rate, as measured by the CPR, will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the internal rate of return (or IRR)/interest income earned on such assets.\nOur borrowings under repurchase agreements are uncommitted and renewable at the discretion of our lenders and, as such, our lenders could determine to reduce or terminate our access to future borrowings at virtually any time. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements, as such terms relate to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities that are the subject of repurchase transactions, generally conform to the terms contained in the standard master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA or the global master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA and the International Capital Market Association. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions, which differ by lender, may include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts (as defined below), purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default and setoff provisions.\n\nFor tax purposes, depending on the transaction structure, a resecuritization transaction may be treated either as a sale or a financing of the underlying MBS. Income recognized from resecuritization transactions will differ for tax and GAAP. For tax purposes, we own and may in the future acquire interests in resecuritization trusts, in which several of the classes of securities are or will be issued with Original Issue Discount (or OID). As the holder of the retained interests in the trust, we generally will be required to include OID in our current gross interest income over the term of the applicable securities as the OID accrues. The rate at which the OID is recognized into taxable income is calculated using a constant rate of yield to maturity, with realized losses impacting the amount of OID recognized in REIT taxable income once they are actually incurred. For tax purposes, REIT taxable income may be recognized in excess of economic income (i.e., OID) or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from these assets, thereby effecting our dividend distribution requirement to stockholders.\nResidential whole loans included in our consolidated balance sheets are generally comprised of pools of fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans acquired through consolidated trusts in secondary market transactions at discounted purchase prices. The accounting model utilized by us is determined at the time each loan package is initially acquired and is generally based on the delinquency status of the majority of the underlying borrowers in the package at acquisition. The accounting model described below under Residential Whole Loans at Carrying Value\u201d is typically utilized by us for loans where the underlying borrower has a delinquency status of less than 60 days at the acquisition date. The accounting model described below under Residential Whole Loans at Fair Value\u201d is typically utilized by us for loans where the underlying borrower has a delinquency status of 60 days or more at the acquisition date. The accounting model initially applied is not subsequently changed.\nPurchase Discounts on Non-Agency MBS and Securities Underlying Linked Transactions\nFair Value Measurements\nIn addition to the regulatory actions being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, on August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release under which it is reviewing interpretive issues related to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C) excludes from the definition of investment company\u201d entities that are primarily engaged in, among other things, purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.\u201d Many companies that engage in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments seek to rely on existing interpretations of the SEC Staff with respect to Section 3(c)(5)(C) so as not to be deemed an investment company for the purpose of regulation under the Investment Company Act. In connection with the concept release, the SEC requested comments on, among other things, whether it should reconsider its existing interpretation of Section 3(c)(5)(C). To date the SEC has not taken or otherwise announced any further action in connection with the concept release. (For additional discussion of the SEC's concept release and its potential impact on us, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nDecember 31, 2015\nThe table below summarizes our exposure to our counterparties at December 31, 2015, by country of domicile:\n\n (3) Includes one counterparty that is a central clearing house for our Swaps. \nInformation About Our Assets\nThe weighted average haircut requirements for the respective underlying collateral types for our repurchase agreements have not significantly changed since December 31, 2014, with the exception of Residential whole loans and Legacy Non-Agency MBS. During 2015, the Company has increased the number of counterparties providing repurchase agreement financing for residential whole loans resulting in a lower overall weighted average haircut. The decrease in the weighted average haircut for Legacy Non-Agency MBS results from the unwind during 2015 of certain re-securitization transactions and subsequent refinancing of the underlying MBS at lower haircut levels.\nOperating and Other Expense for 2014 also included a $1.2 million accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income. No such expense was incurred in 2015.\nfinancing activities and is managed based on our anticipated cash needs. (See Interest Rate Risk\u201d included under\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nGeneral\n (3) Includes cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, securities obtained and pledged as collateral, CRT securities, interest receivable, goodwill, prepaid and other assets, obligation to return securities obtained as collateral of $507.4 million, interest payable, dividends payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities. \n(2) Does not reflect $2.626 billion of RPL/NPL MBS, which are re-performing deals with both fixed rate and hybrid re-performing loans. These deal structures contain a coupon step-up of 300 basis points at 36 months or sooner from issuance.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis and recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative through earnings when: (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows of a hedged item (including forecasted transactions); (ii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii) it is determined that designating the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate.\n\nThe results of our business operations are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets, which is driven by numerous factors, including the supply and demand for residential mortgage assets in the marketplace, the terms and availability of adequate financing, general economic and real estate conditions (both on a national and local level), the impact of government actions in the real estate and mortgage sector, and the credit performance of our credit sensitive residential mortgage assets. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS, the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties. Interest rates and conditional prepayment rates (or CPRs) (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nAt December 31, 2015, $4.752 billion, or 42.5% of our MBS portfolio was invested in Agency MBS. During the year ended 2015, the fair value of our Agency MBS decreased by $1.152 billion. This was due to $1.059 billion of principal repayments,$41.2 million of premium amortization and a $51.3 million decrease in net unrealized gains.\n(6) Excluded the special common stock dividend declared on August 1, 2013.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS\n(3) Weighted average months to reset is the number of months remaining before the coupon interest rate resets. At reset, the MBS coupon will adjust based upon the underlying benchmark interest rate index, margin and periodic or lifetime caps. The months to reset do not reflect scheduled amortization or prepayments.\n (5) Net interest rate spread reflects the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. \nWe finance a significant portion of our MBS and CRT securities with repurchase agreements and other advances. In connection with these financing arrangements, we pledge our securities as collateral to secure the borrowing. The amount of collateral pledged will typically exceed the amount of the financing with the extent of over-collateralization ranging from 1%-6% of the amount borrowed (U.S. Treasury and Agency MBS collateral) to up to 64% (Non-Agency MBS collateral). Consequently, while repurchase agreement financing results in us recording a liability to the counterparty in our consolidated balance sheets, we are exposed to the counterparty, if during the term of the repurchase agreement financing, a lender should default on its obligation and we are not able to recover our pledged assets. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral.\nDuring 2015, the financial market environment was impacted by continued accommodative monetary policy. Repurchase agreement funding for both Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS has been available to us at generally attractive market terms from multiple counterparties. Typically, due to the credit risk inherent to Non-Agency MBS, repurchase agreement funding involving Non-Agency MBS is available from fewer counterparties, at terms requiring higher collateralization and higher interest rates, than repurchase agreement funding secured by Agency MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. Therefore, we generally expect to be able to finance our acquisitions of Agency MBS on more favorable terms than financing for Non-Agency MBS.\n(1) Together with coupon interest, accretable purchase discount is recognized as interest income over the life of the security.\nResults of Operations\n (2) Reflected annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nFor 2015, we had compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expense of $42.0 million, or 1.34% of average equity, compared to $40.7 million, or 1.26% of average equity, for 2014. Compensation and benefits expense increased $712,000 to $26.3 million for 2015, compared to $25.6 million for 2014, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with our wider residential asset strategy. Our other general and administrative expenses increased by $588,000 to $15.8 million for 2015 compared to $15.2 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher IT development and related costs, data analytics and pricing services related expenses and costs associated with our attaining FHLB membership, partially offset by lower professional services related costs.\nDuring 2015, we continued to invest in residential mortgage assets, including both MBS and, through consolidated trusts, residential whole loans. At December 31, 2015, our MBS portfolio was approximately $11.173 billion compared to $12.573 billion (including $1.913 billion MBS reported as components of Linked Transactions) at December 31, 2014.\nOn May 16, 2013, we redeemed all 3,840,000 outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $97.0 million, or $25.27153 per share, including all accrued and unpaid dividends to the Redemption Date. The redemption value of the Series A Preferred Stock exceeded its carrying value by $3.9 million, which represents the original offering costs for the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nThe following table presents information regarding certain of our financial ratios at or for the dates presented:\n(1) Includes loans on which borrowers have defaulted and are not making payments of principal and/or interest as of December 31, 2015.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (or ASU 2014-15). The amendments in this ASU provide guidance in GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an entity's going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a significant impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.\n(5) Represents the sum of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, and obligations to return securities obtained as collateral and Senior Notes divided by stockholders' equity. The increase in our leverage multiple for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 from the quarter ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of $1.520 billion of repurchase agreements previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions.\nFor 2014, our net interest spread and margin were 2.40% and 2.78%, respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 2.32% and 2.70%, respectively, for 2013. Although our net interest spread and margin increased, our net interest income decreased by $14.9 million, or 4.7%, to $304.0 million from $318.9 million for 2013. This decrease primarily reflected the impact of the lower average balance of our MBS portfolio as measured by amortized cost, increased Non-Agency MBS borrowing costs (including the impact of allocated Swap expense), partially offset by higher yielding Non-Agency MBS due to improved credit performance, a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt and lower Agency MBS borrowing costs. It should be noted that our reported net interest income for 2014 and 2013 excluded the interest income on Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities and the interest expense on repurchase agreements financings that had been accounted for as Linked Transactions and for which the net interest income was reported in Other income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. For 2014, the net interest earned on our investments accounted for as Linked Transactions increased by approximately $13.5 million to $16.4 million compared to $2.9 million for 2013. The net interest spread on our Agency MBS portfolio declined slightly to 1.08% for 2014 compared to 1.09% for 2013. The net interest spread on our Non-Agency MBS portfolio increased to 4.70% for 2014 compared to 4.55% for 2013.\n(2) Includes discount designated as Credit Reserve of $877.6 million and OTTI of $23.0 million.\nFor 2014, Other income, net, increased by $33.0 million to $54.8 million from $21.8 million for 2013. In 2014 Other income, net primarily reflected $37.5 million of net gains realized on the sale of certain Non-Agency MBS and unrealized net gains and net interest income of $17.1 million on our Linked Transactions. In addition, during 2014 we recorded net gains on residential whole loans held at fair value of $116,000, primarily reflecting changes in market value of the underlying loans since acquisition. During 2014, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $123.9 million, realizing gross gains of $37.5 million. During 2013, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $152.6 million, and realized gross gains of $25.8 million and sold U.S. Treasury securities for $422.2 million, realizing net losses of approximately $24,000. The unrealized net gains and net interest income from Linked Transactions of $17.1 million for 2014 included interest income of $24.4 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $8.0 million on the borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $677,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. The unrealized net gains and net interest income on Linked Transactions of $3.2 million for 2013 included interest income of $3.9 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $925,000 on borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $281,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. During 2014, certain of our Linked Transactions became unlinked, resulting in our recording Non-Agency MBS with a fair value of $86.4 million on our consolidated balance sheets. The $7.5 million of losses realized on TBA short positions for 2013 reflected losses on the sale of $350.0 million notional of TBA securities.\nWe expense our equity-based compensation awards that are subject to vesting conditions, ratably over the vesting period of such awards, based upon the fair value of such awards at the grant date. Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recorded net of estimated forfeitures expected to occur over the vesting period. (See Notes 2(l) and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nInterest income on our Non-Agency MBS (which includes Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) decreased $10.4 million, or 3.2%, for 2014 to $316.3 million compared to $326.8 million for 2013, primarily due to the decrease in the amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS portfolio, partially offset by the increase in the net yield on our Non-Agency MBS portfolio. For 2014, the average amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS (excluding Non-Agency MBS reported as a component of Linked Transactions) decreased by $399.2 million or 8.9%, to $4.108 billion, from $4.508 billion for 2013. Our Non-Agency MBS portfolio yielded 7.70% for 2014 compared to 7.25% for 2013. The increase in the yield on our Non-Agency MBS was primarily due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the then current and prior year, that had occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. During 2014, we recognized net purchase discount accretion of $103.4 million on our Non-Agency MBS, compared to $73.2 million for 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had net purchase discounts of $1.300 billion, including Credit Reserve and previously recognized OTTI of $900.6 million, on our Non-Agency MBS, or 24.4% of par value. During 2014 we reallocated $95.0 million of purchased discount designated as Credit Reserve to accretable purchase discount.\n\nWe determine the fair value of our Agency MBS, based upon prices obtained from third-party pricing services, which are indicative of market activity and repurchase agreement counterparties.\nIt is our business strategy to hold our MBS as long-term investments. On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our ability and intent to continue to hold each security and, as part of this process, we monitor our securities for other-than-temporary impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of our securities that are in an unrealized loss position, or a deterioration in the underlying characteristics of these securities, could result in our recognizing future impairment charges or a loss upon the sale of any such security. At December 31, 2015, we had net unrealized gains of $28.8 million on our Agency MBS, comprised of gross unrealized gains of $69.2 million and gross unrealized losses of $40.4 million, and net unrealized gains on our Non-Agency MBS of $559.0 million, comprised of gross unrealized gains of $587.3 million and gross unrealized losses of $28.4 million. At December 31, 2015, we did not intend to sell any of our MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, and we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell those securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at their maturity.\nOther Income, net\n(1) Reflects the annualized coupon interest income divided by the average amortized cost. The discounted purchase price on Legacy Non-Agency MBS causes the coupon yield to be higher than the pass-through coupon interest rate.\n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable in the amount of $1.0 million.\nInterest Expense\nWith respect to margin maintenance requirements for repurchase agreements with Non-Agency MBS as collateral, margin calls are typically determined by our counterparties based on their assessment of changes in the fair value of the underlying collateral and in accordance with the agreed upon haircuts specified in the transaction confirmation with the counterparty. We address margin call requests in accordance with the required terms specified in the applicable repurchase agreement and such requests are typically satisfied by posting additional cash or collateral on the same business day. We review margin calls made by counterparties and assess them for reasonableness by comparing the counterparty valuation against our valuation determination. When we believe that a margin call is unnecessary because our assessment of collateral value differs from the counterparty valuation, we typically hold discussions with the counterparty and are able to resolve the matter. In the unlikely event that resolution cannot be reached, we will look to resolve the dispute based on the remedies available to us under the terms of the repurchase agreement, which in some instances may include the engagement of a third party to review collateral valuations. For other agreements that do not include such provisions, we could resolve the matter by substituting collateral as permitted in accordance with the agreement or otherwise request the counterparty to return the collateral in exchange for cash to unwind the financing.\n (6) Net interest margin reflects net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nFor 2015, our net interest spread and margin were 2.33% and 2.65%, respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 2.40% and 2.78%, respectively, for 2014. Our net interest income increased by $11.2 million, or 3.7%, to $315.2 million from $304.0 million for 2014. For 2015, net interest income on RPL/NPL MBS and CRT securities increased by approximately\n (2) Reflects annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nIn addition, we use interest rate Swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure in connection with our repurchase agreement financings. We will make cash payments or pledge securities as collateral as part of a margin arrangement in connection with interest rate Swaps that are in an unrealized loss position. In the event that a counterparty for a Swap that is not subject to central clearing were to default on its obligation, we would be exposed to a loss to a Swap counterparty to the extent that the amount of cash or securities pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated Swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral.\n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable of $1.0 million and $542,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe estimate that for 2015, our taxable income was approximately $307.5 million. Based on dividends paid or declared during 2015, we have undistributed taxable income of approximately $7.6 million, or $0.02 per share. We have until the filing of our 2015 tax return (due not later than September 15, 2016) to declare the distribution of any 2015 REIT taxable income not previously distributed.\nCertain events that are expected to occur over the next few quarters are anticipated to impact the amount of taxable income generated, including (i) the unwind of a resecuritization transaction, which is currently expected to generate taxable income of approximately $0.19 per share, and (ii) the receipt of our share of settlement proceeds in connection with the $8.5 billion settlement of the Bank of America/Countrywide MBS litigation, which is expected to generate taxable income of approximately $0.05 per share.\n\nCongress may continue to consider legislation that would significantly reform the country's mortgage finance system, including, among other things, eliminating Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and replacing them with a single new MBS insurance agency. Many details remain unsettled, including the scope and costs of the agencies's guarantee and their affordable housing mission, some of which could be addressed even in the absence of large-scale reform. While the likelihood of enactment of major mortgage finance system reform in the short term remains uncertain, it is possible that the adoption of any such reforms could adversely affect the types of assets we can buy, the costs of these assets and our business operations. As the FHFA and both houses of Congress continue to consider various measures intended to dramatically restructure the U.S. housing finance system and the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we expect debate and discussion on the topic to continue throughout 2016.\nResidential Whole Loans at Carrying Value\nInterest Income\nTax Considerations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(1) Reflected annualized net income available to common stock and participating securities divided by average total assets.\n (3) Reflects the difference between the net yield on average MBS and average cost of funds on MBS. \nSelected Financial Ratios\n\nResidential Whole Loans, at Fair Value\n(4) Reflects dividends declared per share of common stock divided by earnings per share.\nFor 2014, we had compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expense of $40.7 million, or 1.26% of average equity, compared to $33.7 million, or 1.03% of average equity, for 2013. The $5.3 million increase in our compensation and benefits expense to $25.6 million for 2014, compared to $20.3 million for 2013, primarily reflected increases in equity-based compensation expense, salary and bonus expense, and payroll taxes. Our other general and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million to $15.2 million for 2014 compared to $13.4 million for 2013. The increase was primarily comprised of increases in professional services, board of director expenses and the cost of data and analytical systems.\nThe changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income\u201d and Interest Expense.\u201d\n(5) Reflected total stockholders' equity less the preferred stock liquidation preference divided by total shares of common stock outstanding.\nIn July 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MFA Insurance became a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, MFA Insurance had access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances (subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB). The weighted average haircut on our FHLB advances at December 31, 2015 was 7.00%. However, in January, 2016, the FHFA amended its regulation on FHLB membership, which, among other things, provided termination rules for current captive insurance members. As a result, MFA Insurance will not be permitted new advances or renewal of existing advances and will be required to terminate its FHLB membership and repay any outstanding advances by no later than February 19, 2017. As of December 31, 2015 and February 16, 2016, MFA Insurance had approximately $1.500 billion and $1.200 billion, respectively, in outstanding advances (backed by Agency MBS).\nDuring 2015 we recognized OTTI charges through earnings of $705,000 against certain of our Non-Agency MBS. These impairment charges reflected changes in our estimated cash flows for such securities based on an updated assessment of the estimated future performance of the underlying collateral, including the expected principal loss over the term of the securities and changes in the expected timing of receipt of cash flows. We did not recognize any OTTI charges through earnings against our Non-Agency MBS during 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had 336 Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $40.4 million, 59 RPL/NPL MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $19.3 million and 58 Legacy Non-Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $9.1 million. Impairments on Agency MBS in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 are considered temporary and not credit related. Unrealized losses on Non-Agency MBS for which no OTTI was recorded during the year are considered temporary based on an assessment of changes in the expected cash flows for such securities, which considers recent bond performance and expected future performance of the underlying collateral. Significant judgment is used both in our analysis of expected cash flows for our Legacy Non-Agency MBS and any determination of the credit component of OTTI. (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for more information regarding OTTI.)\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, generally meaning that we are subject to credit losses in these portfolios that correspond to the risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure on the underlying real estate collateral. (See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors - Credit Risks\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), We believe the discounted purchase prices paid on certain of these investments mitigates our risk of loss in the event that, as we expect on most such investments, we receive less than 100% of the par value of these securities or loans. Our investment process for credit sensitive assets involves analysis focused primarily on quantifying and pricing credit risk.\nGross unrealized losses on our Agency MBS were $40.4 million at December 31, 2015. Agency MBS are issued by GSEs and enjoy either the implicit or explicit backing of the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. While our Agency MBS are not rated by any rating agency, they are currently perceived by market participants to be of high credit quality, with risk of default limited to the unlikely event that the U.S. Government would not continue to support the GSEs. Given the credit quality inherent in Agency MBS, we do not consider any of the current impairments on our Agency MBS to be credit related. In assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell any impaired security before its anticipated recovery, which may be at its maturity, we consider for each impaired security, the significance of each investment, the amount of impairment, the projected future performance of such impaired securities, as well as our current and anticipated leverage capacity and liquidity position. Based on these analyses, we determined that at December 31, 2015 any unrealized losses on our Agency MBS were temporary.\n (1) Reflected the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. \nExposure to Financial Counterparties\n\n\n (1) Reflects annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS. \n(3) Reflects total average stockholders' equity divided by total average assets. The decrease for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of $1.918 billion of MBS previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions.\nHedging Activities\nConsolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\nor other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements and/or the fair value of Swaps with our counterparties. We intend to make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements, or take other necessary actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when such actions are considered necessary.\nRepurchase agreement funding for both Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS continues to be available to us from multiple counterparties. Typically, repurchase agreement funding involving Non-Agency MBS is available from fewer counterparties, at terms requiring higher collateralization and higher interest rates, than for repurchase agreement funding involving Agency MBS. In July 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MFA Insurance, became a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, further diversifying our potential sources of funding for residential mortgage investments. However, in January, 2016, the FHFA released its final rule amending its regulation on FHLB membership, which, amongst other things, provided termination rules for current captive insurance members. As a result of such regulation, MFA Insurance will not be permitted new advances or renewal of existing advances and will be required to terminate its FHLB membership within one year of the rule's effective date of February 19, 2016. At December 31, 2015, our debt consisted of borrowings under repurchase agreements with 27 counterparties, FHLB advances, securitized debt, Senior Notes outstanding and obligation to return securities obtained as collateral, resulting in a debt-to-equity multiple of 3.4 times. (See table on page 55 under Results of Operations that presents our quarterly leverage multiples since March 31, 2014.)\n (3) Includes average interest-earning cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. \nIn addition to our investments in Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, we invest in CRT securities, which are debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. At December 31, 2015, our investments in these securities totaled $183.6 million.\nThe following table presents information about our securitized debt at December 31, 2014:\nAt the end of 2015, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2014, due to prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 18 basis points to 2.78% for 2015 from 2.96% for 2014. The net Agency MBS yield decreased to 2.00% for 2015, from 2.23% for 2014. The net yield for our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio was 7.62% for 2015 compared to 7.74% for 2014. The decrease in the net yield on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio is primarily due to prepayments on higher yielding assets in the portfolio, partially offset by increases in accretable discount due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the current and prior year, that have occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. The net yield for our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio was 3.68% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 3.69% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the comparable prior period, the majority of our RPL/NPL MBS were reported as Linked Transactions.\nWhen the fair value of an AFS security is less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date, the security is considered impaired. We assess our impaired securities on at least a quarterly basis and designate such impairments as either temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary.\u201d If we intend to sell an impaired security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security before its anticipated recovery, then we must recognize an OTTI through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not expect to sell an other-than-temporarily impaired security, only the portion of the OTTI related to credit losses is recognized through charges to earnings with the remainder recognized through AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets.\n (1) Yields presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K are calculated using average amortized cost data for securities which excludes unrealized gains and losses and includes principal payments receivable on securities. For GAAP reporting purposes, purchases and sales are reported on the trade date. Average amortized cost data used to determine yields is calculated based on the settlement date of the associated purchase or sale as interest income is not earned on purchased assets and continues to be earned on sold assets until settlement date. Includes Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs. \n (2) The carrying value of such loans reflects the purchase price, accretion of income, cash received and provision for loan losses since acquisition. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of such loans is estimated to be $289.7 million. \nActual maturities of MBS are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities because actual maturities of MBS are affected by the contractual lives of the underlying mortgage loans, periodic payments of principal, and prepayments of principal. The following table presents certain information regarding the amortized costs, weighted average yields and contractual maturities of our MBS at December 31, 2015 and does not reflect the effect of prepayments or scheduled principal amortization on our MBS:\nThe fair value of U.S. Treasury securities obtained as collateral and the associated obligation to return securities obtained as collateral are based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity. Securities obtained as collateral are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nWe believe that we operate in, and intend to continue to operate in, a manner that allows and will continue to allow us to be taxed as a REIT. Provided that we distribute all of our REIT taxable income (including net long-term capital gains) to stockholders in the timeframe permitted by the Code, we do not generally expect to pay corporate level taxes and/or excise taxes. However, such taxes may arise from time to time in the normal course of our business. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. In addition, REIT taxable income calculated at the time our financial statements are prepared is based on certain estimates that may be revised as our tax return, which is not required to be filed until September in the following year, is completed. If we were to fail to meet certain of the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAt December 31, 2015, $6.421 billion, or 57.5% of our MBS portfolios was invested in Non-Agency MBS. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the fair value of our Non-Agency MBS holdings increased by $1.665 billion. The primary components of the change during the year in these Non-Agency MBS include the reclassification of $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS that were previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions and $1.734 billion of purchases (at a weighted average purchase price of 99.9%). Partially offsetting these increases were $1.845 billion of principal repayments and other principal reductions, a decrease reflecting Non-Agency MBS price changes of $66.3 million and the sale of Non-Agency MBS with a fair value of $70.8 million.\n\nOperating and Other Expense\n(2) Reflected annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS.\nWe maintain cash and cash equivalents, unpledged Agency and Non-Agency MBS and collateral in excess of margin requirements held by our counterparties (or collectively, cash and other unpledged collateral\u201d) to meet routine margin calls and protect against unforeseen reductions in our borrowing capabilities. Our ability to meet future margin calls will be impacted by our ability to use cash or obtain financing from unpledged collateral, which can vary based on the market value of such collateral, our cash position and margin requirements. Our cash position fluctuates based on the timing of our operating, investing and\nAt December 31, 2015, we had repurchase agreement borrowings of $7.889 billion of which $3.050 billion was hedged with Swaps, FHLB advances of $1.500 billion and securitized debt of $22.1 million. At December 31, 2015, our Swaps designated in hedging relationships had a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.82% and extended 45 months on average with a maximum remaining term of approximately 92 months.\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance) vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nRecent Market Conditions and Our Strategy\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNon-Agency MBS\nResidential Whole Loans\nOur interest expense for 2014 decreased by $4.2 million, or 2.6% to $159.8 million, from $164.0 million for 2013. This decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt, a decrease in our average borrowings to finance Agency MBS and the lower effective interest rate paid on borrowings to finance Agency MBS, which was partially offset by higher effective funding costs associated with Non-Agency MBS, including allocated Swap financing costs, and securitized debt.\n(3) Reflected total average stockholders' equity divided by total average assets.\n (1) Reflects the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. \nOur residential whole loans pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements are included in the consolidated balance sheets with the fair value of the loans pledged disclosed parenthetically. Purchases and sales of residential whole loans are recorded on the trade date, with amounts recorded reflecting management's current estimate of assets that will be acquired or disposed at the closing of the transaction. This estimate is subject to revision at the closing of the transaction, pending the outcome of due diligence performed prior to closing.\nThe following table presents certain information regarding our 15-year fixed-rate Agency MBS as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n(2) The Non-GAAP Leverage Multiple reflected the sum of our borrowings under repurchase agreements, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, obligations to return securities obtained as collateral, Senior Notes and borrowings that were reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of Linked Transactions of $1.520 billion, $791.8 million, $387.5 million, $206.0 million, $102.7 million, $82.4 million, $33.2 million and $34.1 million at December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, March 31, 2014, December 31, 2013, September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013 respectively. We presented a Non-GAAP leverage multiple since repurchase agreement borrowings that were a component of Linked Transactions may not be linked in the future and, if no longer linked, would be reported as repurchase agreement borrowings, which would increase our leverage multiple. (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nDecember 31, 2015\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. In addition, we consolidate the special purpose entities (or SPEs) created to facilitate the resecuritization transactions completed in prior years and the acquisition of residential whole loans. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\n(3) Includes discount designated as Credit Reserve of $893.1 million and OTTI of $23.0 million.\n(4) Interest only represents MBS backed by mortgages currently in their interest only period. Percentage is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following table presents certain information regarding our Hybrid Agency MBS as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nThe following table sets forth certain information about the average balances of our assets and liabilities and their related yields and costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Average yields are derived by dividing interest income by the average amortized cost of the related assets, and average costs are derived by dividing interest expense by the daily average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. The yields and costs include premium amortization and purchase discount accretion which are considered adjustments to interest rates.\nFor 2015, our net income available to our common stock and participating securities was $298.2 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted common share, relatively unchanged compared to net income available to common stock and participating securities for 2014 of $298.5 million, or $0.81 per basic and diluted common share.\nGeneral\n\nThe effective interest rate paid on our borrowings decreased to 1.81% for 2015 from 1.84% for 2014. This decrease reflects the lower average balance of Agency repurchase agreements and securitized debt, the lower financing rates associated with our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio (including the allocation of Swap expense), partially offset by the increase in our average balance of repurchase agreements used to finance RPL/NPL MBS.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nA decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate impairment at the pool and/or individual loan level thus requiring the establishment of an allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition, adjusted for any increases due to changes in estimated cash flows that are subsequently no longer expected to be received at the relevant measurement date. A significant increase in expected cash flows in subsequent periods first reduces any previously recognized allowance for loan losses and then will result in a recalculation in the amount of accretable yield. The adjustment of accretable yield due to a significant increase in expected cash flows is accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate and results in reclassification from non-accretable difference to accretable yield.\nOur Swap derivative instruments are designated as cash-flow hedges against a portion of our current and forecasted LIBOR-based repurchase agreements. Our Swaps do not extend the maturities of our repurchase agreements; they do, however, lock in a fixed rate of interest over their term for the notional amount of the Swap corresponding to the hedged item. During 2015, we did not enter into any new Swaps and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $710.2 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.96% amortize and/or expire. At December 31, 2015, we had Swaps designated in hedging relationships with an aggregate notional amount of $3.050 billion with a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.82% and a weighted average variable interest rate received of 0.34%.\n (1) Represents private-label MBS issued in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in which the underlying collateral consists of re-performing/non-performing loans that were originated in prior years. Included with the balance of Non-Agency MBS reported on our consolidated balance sheets. \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (or ASU 2015-02). The amendments in this ASU change the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. At the effective date, all previous consolidation analyses that the guidance affects must be reconsidered. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this ASU using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. While we have not yet selected a transition method, we do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-2 to have a significant impact on our financial position.\nWe determine the fair value of our residential whole loans held at fair value after considering portfolio valuations obtained from a third-party who specializes in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans and trading activity observed in the market place. The Company's residential whole loans held at fair value are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nIncome on residential whole loans at carrying value is recognized based on pools of assets with similar credit risk characteristics using an estimated yield based on cash flows expected to be collected over the lives of the loans in such pools rather than the contractual coupons of the underlying loans. As the unit of account is at the pool level rather than the individual loan level, none of our residential whole loans at carrying value are currently considered 90 days or more past due.\n\nThe following table presents additional information regarding our residential whole loans at fair value at December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nKey differences between GAAP net income and REIT Taxable Income for Non-Agency MBS and Residential Whole Loans\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe tables below present certain information about our asset allocation at December 31, 2015.\nAnalysis of Net Interest Income\n\n", "item_7_text": "The following table presents certain quarterly information regarding our net interest spread and net interest margin for the quarterly periods presented:\nDecember 31, 2015\n(4) All principal payments are considered to be prepayments for CPR purposes.\n\nSwaps\nWith respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to increase; (ii) the value of our MBS portfolio and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to decline; (iii) coupons on our ARM-MBS to reset, on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our MBS to decline, thereby slowing the amortization of our MBS purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to increase. Conversely, decreases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (i) the interest expense associated with our borrowings to decrease; (ii) the value of our MBS portfolio and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to increase; (iii) coupons on our ARM-MBS to reset, on a delayed basis, to lower interest rates; (iv) prepayments on our MBS to increase, thereby accelerating the amortization of our MBS purchase premiums and the accretion of our purchase discounts; and (v) the value of our derivative hedging instruments and, correspondingly, our stockholders' equity to decrease. In addition, our borrowing costs and credit lines are further affected by the type of collateral we pledge and general conditions in the credit market.\nThe following table presents the contractual maturities of the residential whole loans held by consolidated trusts at December 31, 2015 and does not reflect estimates of prepayments or scheduled amortization. For residential whole loans at carrying value, amounts presented are estimated based on the underlying loan contractual amounts.\nThe following table presents information regarding the margin requirements, or the percentage amount by which the collateral value is contractually required to exceed the loan amount (this difference is referred to as the haircut\u201d), on our repurchase agreements at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014:\nAt December 31, 2014, we had repurchase agreement borrowings of $8.267 billion of which $3.760 billion was hedged with Swaps, and securitized debt of $110.6 million. At December 31, 2014, our Swaps designated in hedging relationships had a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.85% and extended 47 months on average with a maximum remaining term of approximately 104 months.\nWe are a REIT primarily engaged in the business of investing, on a leveraged basis, in residential mortgage assets, including Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS, residential whole loans and CRT securities. Our principal business objective is to deliver shareholder value through the generation of distributable income and through asset performance linked to residential mortgage credit fundamentals. We selectively invest in residential mortgage assets with a focus on credit analysis, projected prepayment rates, interest rate sensitivity and expected return.\nThe following table presents our leverage multiples, as measured by debt-to-equity, at the dates presented:\nIn making our assessments about OTTIs, we review and consider certain information relating to our financial position and the impaired securities, including the nature of such securities, the contractual collateral requirements impacting us and our investment and leverage strategies, as well as subjective information, including our current and targeted liquidity position, the credit quality and expected cash flows of the underlying assets collateralizing such securities, and current and anticipated market conditions. In determining the OTTI related to credit losses for securities that were purchased at significant discounts to par and/or are considered to be of less than high credit quality, we compare the present value of the remaining cash flows expected to be collected at the purchase date (or last date previously revised) against the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected at the current financial reporting date. The determination as to whether an OTTI exists and, if so, the amount of credit impairment recognized in earnings is subjective, as such determinations are based on factual information available at the time of assessment as well as management's estimates of the future performance and cash flow projections. As a result, the timing and amount of OTTIs constitute material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change.\nOn April 15, 2013, we completed the issuance of 8.0 million shares of our Series B Preferred Stock with a par value of $0.01 per share and a liquidation preference of $25.00 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends, in an underwritten public offering. The aggregate net proceeds to us from the offering of the Series B Preferred Stock were approximately $193.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and related offering expenses. We used a portion of the net proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (as discussed below), and used the remaining net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to acquire additional MBS consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which included, among other things, the repayment of our repurchase agreements.\nOur MBS and CRT securities are valued using various market data points as described above, which management considers directly or indirectly observable parameters. Accordingly, our MBS and CRT securities are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table presents information with respect to our Non-Agency MBS at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. As previously discussed, new accounting guidance that was effective on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting and as a result we did not have any Linked Transactions effective January 1, 2015. Accordingly, on adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2015, we reclassified $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS and $4.6 million of CRT securities that had previously been reported as a component of Linked Transactions to Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities, respectively on our consolidated balance sheets. Non-Agency MBS at December 31, 2014 is presented: (i) excluding Linked Transactions and reported in accordance with GAAP; (ii) underlying our Linked Transactions and reflected consistent with GAAP reporting requirements (effective on such date); and (iii) on a combined basis (Non-GAAP).\nResidential Whole Loans at Fair Value\n (4) Includes exposure to foreign based affiliates of the Canadian parent entity. \n(2) Reflects annualized net income divided by average total stockholders' equity.\nInterest Expense\nInterest Income on our Non-Agency MBS\n\nClassifications of Investment Securities and Assessment for Other-Than-Temporary Impairments\nThe U.S. Congress, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, U.S. Treasury, FDIC, SEC and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken and continue to consider additional actions in response to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulator, an independent bureau housed within the Federal Reserve System, and known as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (or the CFPB). The CFPB has broad authority over a wide range of consumer financial products and services, including mortgage lending. One portion of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act (or Mortgage Reform Act), contains new underwriting and servicing standards for the mortgage industry, as well as restrictions on compensation for mortgage originators. In addition, the Mortgage Reform Act grants broad discretionary regulatory authority to the CFPB to prohibit or condition terms, acts or practices relating to residential mortgage loans that the\nOur Swaps designated as hedging transactions have the effect of modifying the repricing characteristics of our repurchase agreements and cash flows for such liabilities. Under each Swap, we agree to pay a fixed rate of interest and receive a variable interest rate, generally based on one-month or three-month LIBOR, on the notional amount of the Swap. We document our risk-management policies, including objectives and strategies, as they relate to our hedging activities and the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged liability for all Swaps designated as hedging transactions. We assess, both at inception of a hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter, whether or not the hedge relationship is highly effective.\u201d\nThe effective interest rate paid on our borrowings increased to 1.84% for 2014 from 1.76% for 2013. This increase reflected additional higher cost financing (including the impact of allocated Swap expense) associated with our Non-Agency MBS portfolio partially offset by the lower average balance of securitized debt and Agency repurchase agreements. Payments made and/or received on our Swaps are a component of our borrowing costs and accounted for interest expense of $69.8 million or 81 basis points, for 2014, compared to interest expense of $59.0 million, or 63 basis points, for 2013. The weighted average fixed-pay rate on our Swaps decreased to 1.93% for 2014 from 2.08% for 2013. The weighted average variable interest rate received on our Swaps decreased to 0.16% for 2014 from 0.19% for 2013. During 2014, we entered into four new Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $400.0 million, a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.95% with initial maturities ranging from five to seven years, and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $685.0 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 2.28% amortize and/or expire.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had total assets of approximately $13.167 billion, of which $11.173 billion, or 84.9%, represented our MBS portfolio. At such date, our MBS portfolio was comprised of $4.752 billion of Agency MBS and $6.421 billion of Non-Agency MBS which includes $3.795 billion of Legacy Non-Agency MBS and $2.626 billion of RPL/NPL MBS. In addition, at December 31, 2015, we had approximately $895.1 million in residential whole loans acquired through our consolidated trusts, which represented approximately 6.8% of our total assets. Our remaining investment-related assets were primarily comprised of collateral obtained in connection with reverse repurchase agreements, cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), CRT securities, MBS-related receivables, derivative instruments, and REO.\nThe following table presents information with respect to the yield components of our Non-Agency MBS for the periods presented:\nand due diligence related expenses associated with acquisitions closed over the past year. Also included in this expense category is the impact of loan loss provisions and non-recoverable REO maintenance and other loan related expenses that are incurred in connection with our investments in this asset class.\nOur accounting policies are described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management believes the more significant of these to be as follows:\nFor 2015, Other income, net, decreased by $3.6 million to $51.2 million from $54.8 million for 2014. Other income, net for 2015 primarily reflects $34.9 million of gross gains realized on the sale of $70.7 million Non-Agency MBS, a $17.7 million net gain recorded on residential whole loans held at fair value, and $1.8 million of net losses related to loans transferred to REO during the year. During 2014, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $123.9 million and realized gross gains of $37.5 million. In addition, the year ended 2014 included unrealized net gains and net interest income on Linked Transactions of $17.1 million, which included interest income of $24.4 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $8.0 million on borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $677,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. As previously mentioned, new accounting guidance effective on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting and as a result we did not have any Linked Transactions effective January 1, 2015 (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nRegulatory Developments\nDuring 2013, we entered into TBA short positions as a means of managing interest rate risk and MBS basis risk associated with our investment and financing activities. A TBA short position is a forward contract for sale of Agency MBS at a predetermined price, face amount, issuer, coupon and stated maturity on an agreed-upon future date. The specific Agency MBS that could be delivered into the contract upon the settlement date, published each month by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (or SIFMA), are not known at the time of the transaction.\nThe following table presents the components of the net interest spread earned on our Agency, Legacy Non-Agency MBS and RPL/NPL MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nDecember 31, 2014\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (or ASU 2014-09). The ASU requires an entity to recognize revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. ASU 2014-09 originally would have been effective for public business entities for annual periods, and interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application is not permitted. The standard permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. On April 29, 2015, the FASB proposed a one-year deferral of the effective date for ASU 2014-09. On July 9, 2015 the FASB affirmed its proposal to defer the effective date of the new revenue standard for all entities by one year. As a result, public entities would apply the new revenue standard to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods therein. The FASB would also permit entities to adopt the standard early, but not before the original public entity effective date. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2014-09 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. We have not yet selected a transition method nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting.\n(5) Agency 3/1, 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 Hybrid ARM-MBS with coupon less than 4.5%.\nResidential Whole Loans\nSecurities Obtained and Pledged as Collateral/Obligation to Return Securities Obtained as Collateral\n\nOur principal sources of cash generally consist of borrowings under repurchase agreements and other collateralized financings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our MBS portfolio, cash generated from our operating results and, to the extent such transactions are entered into, proceeds from capital market and structured financing transactions. Our most significant uses of cash are generally to pay principal and interest on our financing transactions, to purchase MBS and residential whole loans, to make dividend payments on our capital stock, to fund our operations and to make other investments that we consider appropriate.\nInterest Income\nWeak economic conditions in Europe could potentially impact our major European financial counterparties, with the possibility that this would also impact the operations of their U.S. domiciled subsidiaries. This could adversely affect our financing and operations as well as those of the entire mortgage sector in general. Management monitors our exposure to our repurchase agreement and Swap counterparties on a regular basis, using various methods, including review of recent rating agency actions\nOur expectations with respect to our securities in an unrealized loss position may change over time, given, among other things, the dynamic nature of markets and other variables. Future sales or changes in our expectations with respect to securities in an unrealized loss position could result in us recognizing OTTI charges or realizing losses on sales of MBS in the future. (See Notes 2(b) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nThe table below presents the composition of our MBS portfolios with respect to repricing characteristics as of December 31, 2015:\nResecuritization transactions result in differences between GAAP net income and REIT Taxable Income\nNet Interest Income\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs (or ASU 2015-03). The amendments in this ASU require that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt issued at a discount. The recognition and measurement guidance of debt issuance costs are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2015-03 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not previously been issued and entities should apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-03 to have a significant impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (or ASU) 2016-01, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (or ASU 2016-01).The amendments in this ASU affect all entities that hold financial assets or owe financial liabilities, and address certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The classification and measurement guidance of investments in debt securities and loans are not affected by the amendments in this ASU. ASU 2016-01 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Early adoption is not permitted for public business entities, except for a provision related to financial statements of fiscal years or interim periods that have not yet been issued, to recognize in other comprehensive income, the change in fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk measured using the fair value option. Entities should apply the amendments in this ASU by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-01 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nWe currently expect to continue to seek more credit sensitive, less interest rate sensitive residential mortgage assets during 2016, particularly residential whole loans and Non-Agency MBS (including RPL/NPL MBS). In order to achieve our current investment strategy, we may continue to permit more interest rate sensitive Agency MBS to pay down.\nTBA short positions were accounted for as derivative instruments since we could not assert that it was probable at inception and throughout the term of the TBA contract that we would physically deliver the Agency security upon settlement of the contract. TBA short positions were presented as either derivative assets or liabilities, at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses associated with TBA short positions were reported in Other income, net on our consolidated statements of operations.\n(3) Low loan balance represents MBS collateralized by mortgages with original loan balance of less than or equal to $175,000.\nAt December 31, 2015, we did not use credit default swaps or other forms of credit protection to hedge the exposures summarized in the table above.\n (1) Reflects coupon interest income divided by the average amortized cost. The discounted purchase price on Legacy Non-Agency MBS causes the coupon yield to be higher than the pass-through coupon interest rate. \n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable of $1.0 million and $542,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe have awarded dividend equivalents that may be granted as a separate instrument or may be a right associated with the grant of another equity-based award. Compensation expense for separately awarded dividend equivalents is based on the grant date fair value of such awards and is recognized over the vesting period. Payments pursuant to these dividend equivalents are charged to Stockholders' Equity. Payments pursuant to dividend equivalents that are attached to equity-based awards are charged to Stockholders' Equity to the extent that the attached equity awards are expected to vest. Compensation expense is recognized for payments made for dividend equivalents to the extent that the attached equity awards do not or are not expected to vest and grantees are not required to return payments of dividends or dividend equivalents to the Company.\nThe following describes the valuation methodologies used for our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis, as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nInterest income on our Non-Agency MBS (which includes Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) increased $47.2 million, or 14.9%, for 2015 to $363.6 million compared to $316.3 million for 2014. Non-Agency MBS interest income reflected the inclusion of MBS that, prior to January 1, 2015, were accounted for as components of Linked Transactions and income from such securities was reported in Other Income, net in prior periods. In addition, primarily due to the accounting change for Linked Transactions, the average amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS increased by $1.916 billion or 46.6%, to $6.024 billion for 2015, from $4.108 billion for 2014. Our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio yielded 7.62% for 2015 compared to 7.74% for 2014. The decrease in the yield on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS is primarily due to prepayments on higher yielding assets in the portfolio, partially offset by increases in accretable discount due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the current and prior year, that have occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio yielded 3.68% for 2015 compared to 3.69% for 2014. During 2015, we recognized net purchase discount accretion of $92.8 million on our Non-Agency MBS, compared to $103.4 million for 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had net purchase discounts of $1.096 billion, including Credit Reserve and previously recognized OTTI of $787.5 million, on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS, or 25.4% of par value. During 2015 we reallocated $41.1 million of purchased discount designated as Credit Reserve to accretable purchase discount.\nThe following table presents certain information regarding the composition of our Agency MBS portfolio as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nDuring 2010, we granted certain RSUs that vested after either two or four years of service and provided that certain criteria were met, which were based on a formula that included changes in our closing stock price over a two- or four-year period and dividends declared on our common stock during those periods. From 2011 through 2013, we granted certain RSUs that vested annually over a one or three-year period, provided that certain criteria were met, which were based on a formula tied to our achievement of average total stockholder return during that three-year period. During 2014 and 2015, we made grants of RSUs certain of which cliff vest after a three-year period and certain of which cliff vest after a three-year period, subject to the achievement of certain performance criteria, based on a formula tied to our achievement of average total stockholder return during that three-year period. The features in these awards related to the attainment of total stockholder return over a specified period constitute a market condition\u201d which impacts the amount of compensation expense recognized for these awards. Specifically, the uncertainty regarding the achievement of the market condition was reflected in the grant date fair valuation of the RSUs, which in addition to estimates regarding the amount of RSUs expected to be forfeited during the associated service period, determined the amount of compensation expense recognized. The amount of compensation expense recognized was not dependent on whether the market condition was or will be achieved, while differences in actual forfeiture experience relative to estimated forfeitures results in adjustments to the timing and amount of compensation expense recognized.\nOTTI\nWe expect that our interest expense and funding costs for 2016 will be impacted by market interest rates, the amount of our borrowings and incremental hedging activity, existing and future interest rates on our hedging instruments and the extent to which we execute additional longer-term structured financing transactions. As a result of these variables, our borrowing costs cannot be predicted with any certainty. (See Notes 6, 8 and 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nFinancial Instruments - Overall - Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nLevel 2 - inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instrument.\nDuring 2014 and 2013, we did not recognize any OTTI charges through earnings against our Non-Agency MBS. At December 31, 2014, we had 271 Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $33.6 million and 45 Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities with a gross unrealized loss of $5.8 million. Impairments on Agency MBS in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2014 are considered temporary and not credit related. Unrealized losses on Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities for which no OTTI was recorded during the year were considered temporary based on an assessment of changes in the expected cash flows for such securities, which considered recent bond performance and expected future performance of the underlying collateral. Significant judgment was used both in the Company's analysis of expected cash flows for its Legacy Non-Agency MBS and any determination of the credit component of OTTI. (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for more information regarding OTTI.)\nThe following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates (yield/cost) and changes in the volume (average balance) of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. Information is provided in each category with respect to: (i) the changes attributable to changes in volume (changes in average balance multiplied by prior rate); (ii) the changes attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior average balance); and (iii) the net change. The changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately, based on absolute values, to the changes due to rate and volume.\n (4) Average cost of repurchase agreements includes the cost of Swaps allocated based on the proportionate share of the overall estimated weighted average portfolio duration. \nBased on the projected cash flows for our Non-Agency MBS purchased at a discount to par value, a portion of the purchase discount may be designated as Credit Reserve, which effectively mitigates our risk of loss on the mortgages collateralizing such MBS and is not expected to be accreted into interest income. The amount designated as Credit Reserve may be adjusted over time, based on the actual performance of the security, its underlying collateral, actual and projected cash flow from such collateral, economic conditions and other factors. If the performance of a security with a Credit Reserve is more favorable than forecasted, a portion of the amount designated as Credit Reserve may be reallocated to accretable discount and recognized into interest income over time. Conversely, if the performance of a security with a Credit Reserve is less favorable than forecasted, the amount designated as Credit Reserve may be increased, or impairment charges and write-downs of such securities to a new cost basis could result.\nThe following table presents the changes in the components of purchase discount on Non-Agency MBS with respect to purchase discount designated as Credit Reserve and OTTI, and accretable purchase discount for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. As previously discussed, new accounting guidance that was effective for us on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting and as a result we did not have any Linked Transactions effective January 1, 2015. The information presented for the year ended December 31, 2014 includes securities underlying Linked Transactions and is presented on both a GAAP and Non-GAAP basis (effective on such date):\n (2) The effective yield adjustment is the difference between the net yield, calculated utilizing management's estimates of timing and amount of future cash flows for Legacy Non-Agency MBS and RPL/NPL MBS, less the current coupon yield. \nThe following table presents the components of the coupon yield and net yields earned on our Agency MBS, Legacy Non-Agency MBS and RPL/NPL MBS and weighted average CPR experienced for such MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\n (2) Reflects annualized interest expense divided by average balance of repurchase agreements and other advances, including the cost of Swaps allocated based on the proportionate share of the overall estimated weighted average portfolio duration and securitized debt. Agency cost of funding includes 74, 74, 70, 78, 79, 82, 81 and 85 basis points and Legacy Non-Agency cost of funding includes 69, 66, 68,78, 84, 89, 88 and 74 basis points associated with Swaps to hedge interest rate sensitivity on these assets for the quarters ended December 31, 2015, September 30, 2015, June 30, 2015, March 31, 2015, December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014 and March 31, 2014, respectively. \nOperating and Other Expense\n\n(3) 3 month average CPR weighted by positions as of the beginning of each month in the quarter.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn this low interest rate environment, we continue to transition to more credit sensitive, less interest sensitive residential mortgage assets. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we purchased through consolidated trusts residential whole loans of approximately $608.3 million, with an unpaid principal balance of approximately $770.5 million. At December 31, 2015, our total recorded investment in residential whole loans was $895.1 million. Of this amount, $271.8 million is presented as residential whole loans at carrying value and $623.3 million as residential whole loans at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized approximately $16.0 million of income on residential whole loans held at carrying value in Interest Income on our consolidated statement of operations, representing an effective yield of 6.63% (excluding servicing costs). In addition, we recorded net gains on residential whole loans held at fair value of $17.7 million in Other Income, net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor Agency MBS, the valuation methodology of our third-party pricing services incorporate commonly used market pricing methods, trading activity observed in the market place and other data inputs. The methodology also considers the underlying characteristics of each security, which are also observable inputs, including: collateral vintage, coupon, maturity date, loan age, reset date, collateral type, periodic and life cap, geography, and prepayment speeds. Management analyzes pricing data received from third-party pricing services and compares it to other indications of fair value including data received from repurchase agreement counterparties and its own observations of trading activity observed in the market place.\n(4) Home Affordable Refinance Program (or HARP) MBS are backed by refinanced loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80% at origination.\n(1) Reflected the annualized coupon interest income divided by the average amortized cost. The discounted purchase price on Non-Agency MBS causes the coupon yield to be higher than the pass-through coupon interest rate. (Does not include MBS underlying our Linked Transactions. See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable of $1.0 million and $542,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe net interest spread on our Agency MBS portfolio declined to 0.88% for 2015 compared to 1.08% for 2014. The net interest spread on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio increased to 4.80% for 2015 compared to 4.73% for 2014. The net interest spread on our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio was 2.01% for 2015 compared to 2.10% for 2014. In the comparable prior period, the majority of our RPL/NPL MBS were reported as Linked Transactions with net interest income reported in Other Income, net.\namortization compared to a CPR of 13.0% and $46.8 million of net premium amortization in 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had net purchase premiums on our Agency MBS of $172.0 million, or 3.8% of current par value, compared to net purchase premiums of $213.3 million, or 3.8% of par value at December 31, 2014.\nCertain of our residential whole loans are presented at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as a result of a fair value election made at time of acquisition. Given the significant uncertainty associated with estimating the timing of and amount of cash flows associated with these loans that will be collected, and that the cash flows ultimately collected may be dependent on the value of the property securing the loan, we consider that accounting for these loans at fair value should result in a better reflection over time of the economic returns from these loans. We determine the fair value of our residential whole loans held at fair value after considering portfolio valuations obtained from a third-party who specializes in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans and trading activity observed in the market place. Subsequent changes in fair value are reported in current period earnings and presented in Net gain on residential whole loans held at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations.\n(1) Reflects annualized net income available to common stock and participating securities divided by average total assets. The decrease for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of $1.918 billion of MBS previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions.\nOur investments in securities are primarily comprised of Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS, as discussed and detailed in Notes 2(b) and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All of our MBS are designated as available-for-sale (or AFS) and, accordingly, are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings (except when an OTTI is recognized, as discussed below) and reported in AOCI, a component of Stockholders' Equity. We do not intend to hold any of our investment securities for trading purposes; however, if available-for-sale securities were classified as trading securities, there could be substantially greater volatility in our earnings.\nDuring 2015, we recognized credit-related OTTI losses through earnings related to our Non-Agency MBS of $705,000. At December 31, 2015, we did not intend to sell any MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, and it is more likely than not\u201d that we will not be required to sell these MBS before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at their maturity.\n (2) Reflected annualized interest expense divided by average balance of repurchase agreements, including the cost of Swaps allocated based on the proportionate share of the overall estimated weighted average portfolio duration, and securitized debt. Agency cost of funding included 79, 82, 81, 85, 86 and 74 basis points and Non-Agency cost of funding included 84, 89, 88, 74, 72 and 57 basis points associated with Swaps to hedge interest rate sensitivity on these assets for the quarters ended December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, March 31, 2014, December 31, 2013 and September 30, 2013, respectively. Agency cost of funding includes 100 and 88 basis points associated with Swaps to hedge interest rate sensitivity on these assets for the quarters ended June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013, respectively. Non-Agency funding cost did not include any costs associated with Swaps in those periods. \nIn assessing the performance of our Non-Agency MBS portfolio prior to January 1, 2015, we did not view these transactions as linked, but rather viewed the performance of the underlying Non-Agency MBS and the related repurchase agreement borrowings as we would any other Non-Agency MBS that was not part of a linked transaction. Accordingly, as Linked Transaction accounting was discontinued on January 1, 2015, we consider that the Non-GAAP information disclosed in the above table for prior periods provides appropriate comparability to current period disclosures for our Non-Agency MBS portfolio.\nCPR levels are impacted by, among other things, conditions in the housing market, new regulations, government and private sector initiatives, interest rates, availability of credit to home borrowers, underwriting standards and the economy in general. In particular, CPR reflects the conditional repayment rate (or CRR), which measures voluntary prepayments of mortgages collateralizing a particular MBS, and the conditional default rate (or CDR), which measures involuntary prepayments resulting from defaults. CPRs on Agency MBS and Legacy Non-Agency MBS may differ significantly. For the year ended December 31, 2015, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a weighted average CPR of 13.2%, and our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio experienced a CPR of 14.1%. For the year ended December 31, 2014, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a weighted average CPR of 13.0%, and our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio (including Legacy Non-Agency MBS underlying our Linked Transactions) experienced a CPR of 12.3%. Over the last consecutive eight quarters, ending with December 31, 2015, the monthly fair value weighted average CPR on our Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolios ranged from a high of 16.7% experienced during the month ended July 31, 2015 to a low of 10.4%, experienced during each of the months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014, with an average CPR over such quarters of 13.1%.\nCurrent period estimated taxable and items expected to impact future taxable income\nWe believe that our $787.5 million Credit Reserve and OTTI appropriately factors in remaining uncertainties regarding underlying mortgage performance and the potential impact on future cash flows for our existing Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Home price appreciation and underlying mortgage loan amortization have decreased the LTV for many of the mortgages underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Home price appreciation during the past few years has generally been driven by a combination of limited housing supply, low mortgage rates, capital flows into own-to-rent foreclosure purchases and demographic-driven U.S. household formation. We estimate that the average LTV of mortgage loans underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS has declined from approximately 105% as of January 2012 to approximately 71% as of December 31, 2015. In addition, we estimate that the percentage of non-delinquent loans underlying our Legacy Non-Agency MBS that are underwater (with LTVs greater than 100%), has declined from approximately 52% as of January 2012 to 7% at December 31, 2015. Lower LTVs lessen the likelihood of defaults and simultaneously decrease loss severities. Further, during 2014 and 2015, we have also observed faster voluntary prepayment (i.e. prepayment of loans in full with no loss) speeds than originally projected. The yields on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS that were purchased at a discount are generally positively impacted if prepayment rates on these securities exceed our prepayment assumptions. Based on these current conditions, we have reduced estimated future losses within our Legacy Non-Agency portfolio. As a result, during the year ended 2015, $41.1 million was transferred from Credit Reserve to accretable discount. This increase in accretable discount is expected to increase the interest income realized over the remaining life of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS. The remaining average contractual life of such assets is approximately 20 years, but based on scheduled loan amortization and prepayments (both voluntary and involuntary), loan balances will decline substantially over time. Consequently, we believe that the majority of the impact on interest income from the reduction in Credit Reserve will occur over the next ten years.\n\nThe following table presents the components of the coupon yield and net yields earned on our Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS and weighted average CPR experienced for such MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nAgency MBS\n(3) Low Loan Balance represents MBS collateralized by mortgages with an original loan balance less than or equal to $175,000. HARP MBS are backed by refinanced loans with LTVs greater than or equal to 80% at origination.\nSwaps are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, as assets, if their fair value is positive, or as liabilities, if their fair value is negative. Changes in the fair value of our Swaps designated in hedging transactions are recorded in OCI provided that the hedge remains effective. Changes in fair value for any ineffective amount of a Swap are recognized in earnings. We have not recognized any change in the value of our existing Swaps designated as hedges through earnings as a result of hedge ineffectiveness.\nNotwithstanding that majority of these loans are considered to be performing substantially in accordance with their current contractual terms and conditions, we have elected to account for these loans as credit impaired as they were acquired at discounted prices that reflect, in part, the impaired credit history of the borrower. Substantially all of the borrowers have previously experienced payment delinquencies and the amount owed on the mortgage loan may exceed the value of the property pledged as collateral. Consequently, we have assessed that these loans have a higher likelihood of default than newly originated mortgage loans with LTVs of 80% or less to credit worthy borrowers. We believe that amounts paid to acquire these loans represent fair market value at the date of acquisition. Such loans are initially recorded at fair value with no allowance for loan losses. Subsequent to acquisition, the recorded amount reflects the original investment amount, plus accretion of interest income, less principal and interest cash flows received. These loans are presented on our consolidated balance sheets at carrying value, which reflects the recorded amount reduced by any allowance for loan losses established subsequent to acquisition.\n(1) Represented the sum of borrowings under repurchase agreements, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, and obligations to return securities obtained as collateral and Senior Notes divided by stockholders' equity.\nWe determine the fair value of our non-centrally cleared Swaps considering valuations obtained from a third-party pricing service. For Swaps that are cleared by a central clearing house, valuations provided by the clearing house are used. All valuations obtained are tested with internally developed models that apply readily observable market parameters. We consider the creditworthiness of both us and our counterparties, along with collateral provisions contained in each derivative agreement, from the perspective of both us and our counterparties. All of our Swaps are subject either to bilateral collateral arrangements, or for cleared Swaps, to the clearing house's margin requirements. Consequently, no credit valuation adjustment was made in determining the fair value of such instruments. Our Swaps are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\n(1) Includes discount designated as Credit Reserve of $766.0 million and OTTI of $21.5 million.\nCFPB finds abusive, unfair, deceptive or predatory, as well as to take other actions that the CFPB finds are necessary or proper to ensure responsible affordable mortgage credit remains available to consumers. The Dodd-Frank Act also affects the securitization of mortgages (and other assets) with requirements for risk retention by securitizers and requirements for regulating Rating Agencies.\nInterest income on our Agency MBS for 2015 decreased by $36.7 million, or 25.8% to $105.8 million from $142.5 million for 2014. This change primarily reflects a $1.106 billion decrease in the average amortized cost of our Agency MBS portfolio to $5.282 billion for 2015 from $6.388 billion for 2014. In addition, the net yield on our Agency MBS decreased to 2.00% for 2015 from 2.23% for 2014. At the end of 2015, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2014, as a result of prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 18 basis points to 2.78% for 2015 from 2.96% for 2014. During 2015, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a 13.2% CPR and we recognized a $41.2 million of net premium\n (2) Includes European-based counterparties as well as U.S.-domiciled subsidiaries of the European parent entity. \nDecember 31, 2014\n\nNew accounting guidance that was effective at the beginning of the year prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting. Accordingly, on adoption of the new standard on January 1, 2015, we reclassified $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS and $4.6 million of CRT securities that were previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions to Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities respectively on the consolidated balance sheets. In addition, liabilities of $1.520 billion that were previously presented as a component of Linked Transactions were reclassified to Repurchase agreements on the consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, an amount of $4.5 million representing net unrealized gains on securities previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions as of December 31, 2014 was reclassified from Accumulated deficit to AOCI (See Notes 2(t) and 6 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\nFor 2014, we had net income available to our common stock and participating securities of $298.5 million, or $0.81 per basic and diluted common share, compared to net income available to common stock and participating securities of $285.0 million, or $0.78 per basic and diluted common share, for 2013. The increase in net income available to our common stock and participating securities, and the increase of this item on a per share basis primarily reflected an increase in unrealized net gains and net interest income from Linked Transactions, higher gains on sales of MBS partially offset by a reduction in net interest income. Yields on Agency MBS were lower for 2014 compared to 2013 and were impacted by lower coupon yields. Non-Agency MBS yields were higher compared to the prior year period due primarily to the impact of credit reserve releases. In addition, during 2013, we had $7.5 million of unrealized losses on forward contracts for the sale of Agency MBS securities on a generic pool, or to-be-announced basis (or TBA short positions), a $3.9 million write-off of issuance costs on the redemption of the Series A Preferred Stock (see Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and a $2.0 million charge related to the impairment of resecuritization related costs. None of these items re-occurred in 2014.\nOur total Non-Agency MBS portfolio for tax differs from our portfolio reported for GAAP primarily due to the fact that for tax purposes; (i) certain of the MBS contributed to the variable interest entities (or VIEs) used to facilitate resecuritization transactions were deemed to be sold; and (ii) the tax portfolio includes certain securities issued by these VIEs. In addition, for our Non-Agency MBS tax portfolio, potential timing differences arise with respect to the accretion of market discount into income and recognition of realized losses for tax purposes as compared to GAAP. Consequently, our REIT taxable income calculated in a given period may differ significantly from our GAAP net income.\n\n\n(5) MBS issued in June 2009 or later. Majority of underlying loans are ineligible to refinance through the HARP program.\n(2) Weighted average is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe information presented as of December 31, 2014 in the above tables on pages 42-43, includes certain underlying Non-Agency MBS and the associated repurchase agreement borrowings that were disclosed both separately and/or on a combined basis with our Non-Agency MBS portfolio. Prior to January 1, 2015, for GAAP financial reporting purposes, we were required to account for these items as Linked Transactions. Consequently, the presentation of this information in the above tables constitutes Non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Regulation G, as promulgated by the SEC.\n(4) Reflected dividends declared per share of common stock divided by earnings per share.\nan unlimited amount (subject to the terms and limitations of our charter) of common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares representing preferred stock, warrants, debt securities, rights and/or units pursuant to our automatic shelf registration statement and, at December 31, 2015, we had 6.8 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to our DRSPP shelf registration statement. During 2015, we issued 162,373 shares of common stock through our DRSPP, raising net proceeds of approximately $1.2 million.\nWe may use a variety of derivative instruments to economically hedge a portion of our exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk and prepayment risk. The objective of our risk management strategy is to reduce fluctuations in net book value over a range of interest rate scenarios. In particular, we attempt to mitigate the risk of the cost of our variable rate liabilities increasing during a period of rising interest rates. Our derivative instruments are currently comprised of Swaps, which are designated as cash flow hedges against the interest rate risk associated with certain of our borrowings. Prior to 2015, our derivative financial instruments also included Linked Transactions, which were not designated as hedging instruments. New accounting guidance that was effective for us on January 1, 2015 prospectively eliminated the use of Linked Transaction accounting. During 2013, we also entered into TBA short positions which were not designated as hedging instruments.\nOur method of accounting for Non-Agency MBS purchased at significant discounts to par value, requires us to make assumptions with respect to each security. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, future interest rates, voluntary prepayment rates, default rates, mortgage modifications and loss severities. As part of our Non-Agency MBS surveillance process, we track and compare each security's actual performance over time to the performance expected at the time of purchase or, if we have modified our original purchase assumptions, to our revised performance expectations. To the extent that actual performance or our expectation of future performance of our Non-Agency MBS deviates materially from our expected performance parameters, we may revise our performance expectations, such that the amount of purchase discount designated as credit discount may be increased or decreased over time. Nevertheless, credit losses greater than those anticipated or in excess of the recorded purchase discount could occur, which could materially adversely impact our operating results.\n\n$60.3 million. Prior to January 1, 2015, the majority of these assets and associated repurchase agreement financings were reported as components of Linked Transactions with net income reported in Other Income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. This increase was partially offset by the $58.9 million decline in net interest income from Agency and Legacy Non-Agency MBS compared to 2014, primarily due to lower average balances of these MBS and associated Agency repurchase financings. In addition, net interest income for 2015 compared to 2014 was approximately $6.2 million higher due to higher investments in residential whole loans at carrying value and lower outstanding balances of securitized debt.\nIn determining the fair value of our Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities, management considers a number of observable market data points, including prices obtained from pricing services and brokers as well as dialogue with market participants. In valuing Non-Agency MBS, we understand that pricing services use observable inputs that include, in addition to trading activity observed in the market place, loan delinquency data, credit enhancement levels and vintage, which are taken into account to assign pricing factors such as spread and prepayment assumptions. For tranches of Legacy Non-Agency MBS that are cross-collateralized, performance of all collateral groups involved in the tranche are considered. We collect and consider current market intelligence on all major markets, including benchmark security evaluations and bid-lists from various sources, when available.\nWe seek to employ a diverse capital raising strategy under which we may issue capital stock and other types of securities. To the extent we raise additional funds through capital market transactions, we currently anticipate using the net proceeds from such transactions to acquire additional MBS and residential whole loans, consistent with our investment policy, and for working capital, which may include, among other things, the repayment of our financing transactions. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to access the capital markets at any particular time or on any particular terms. We have available for issuance\nInformation is not presented for residential whole loans at carrying value as income is recognized based on pools of assets with similar risk characteristics using an estimated yield based on cash flows expected to be collected over the lives of the loans in such pools rather than on the contractual coupons of the underlying loans.\nDecember 31, 2014\n(2) Reflected annualized net income divided by average total stockholders' equity.\n(7) Excluded the special common stock dividend declared on March 4, 2013.\n (1) Reflected annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS. \n\n(2) Weighted average is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2015, we have access to various sources of liquidity which we estimate to be in excess of $571.0 million. This amount includes (i) $165.0 million of cash and cash equivalents; (ii) $241.7 million in estimated financing available from unpledged Agency MBS and from other Agency MBS collateral that is currently pledged in excess of contractual requirements; and (iii) $164.3 million in estimated financing available from unpledged Non-Agency MBS. Consequently, we believe that we are positioned to continue to take advantage of investment opportunities within the residential mortgage marketplace. In 2016, we intend to continue to selectively acquire MBS and residential whole loans. In addition, while the majority of our Legacy Non-Agency MBS will not return their full face value due to loan defaults, we believe that they will deliver attractive loss adjusted yields due to our discounted average amortized cost of 75% of face value at December 31, 2015.\nOur interest expense for 2015 increased by $17.1 million, or 10.7% to $176.9 million, from $159.8 million for 2014. This increase primarily reflects an increase in our average borrowings to finance RPL/NPL MBS (primarily due to the reclassification of repurchase agreements previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions as discussed above), residential whole loans and CRT securities, and utilization of FHLB advances, which was partially offset by a decrease in our average repurchase agreement borrowings to finance Agency MBS, lower financing rates on Legacy Non-Agency MBS, and a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt.\nOur book value per common share was $7.47 as of December 31, 2015. Book value per common share decreased from $8.12 as of December 31, 2014 due primarily to the impact of realized gains on sales and discount accretion income on Legacy Non-Agency MBS that was recognized and paid as dividends during the year, the change in the value of our Swaps, and lower unrealized gains on our Agency MBS and Legacy Non-Agency MBS, resulting from lower asset values.\nPresentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern\n (3) Reflected the difference between the net yield on average MBS and average cost of funds on MBS. \nDuring 2014, we recorded $3.4 million of other investment related operating expenses related to our residential whole loan activities. In addition, during 2014, an interest accrual of $1.2 million was recorded, reflecting an additional accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income. During 2013, we recorded an excise tax and interest accrual of $2.0 million reflecting an updated estimate of excise tax payable in respect of undistributed REIT taxable income for the 2012 tax year and an additional accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income and recorded $250,000 reflecting an estimate of excise tax payable in respect of undistributed REIT taxable income for the 2013 tax year. In addition, for 2013, we realized a $2.0 million charge related to the impairment of resecuritization related costs.\nthat these unrealized losses are credit related, but are rather a reflection of current market yields and/or market place bid-ask spreads. We have reviewed our Non-Agency MBS that are in an unrealized loss position to identify those securities with losses that are other-than-temporary based on an assessment of changes in expected cash flows for such securities, which considers recent bond performance, where possible, and expected future performance of the underlying collateral.\nAlthough permitted under certain circumstances, we do not offset cash collateral receivables or payables against our net derivative positions.\nInterest income on our Agency MBS for 2014 decreased by $13.5 million, or 8.7% to $142.5 million from $156.0 million for 2013. This change primarily reflected a $453.0 million decrease in the average amortized cost of our Agency MBS portfolio to $6.388 billion for 2014 from $6.841 billion for 2013 and a decrease in the net yield on our Agency MBS to 2.23% for 2014 from 2.28% for 2013. At the end of 2014, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2013, due to acquisition of assets in the marketplace at generally lower coupons and as a result of prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 17 basis points to 2.96% for 2014 from 3.13% for 2013. During 2014, our Agency MBS portfolio experienced a 13.0% CPR and we recognized a $46.8 million of net premium amortization compared to a CPR of 17.9% and $57.9 million of net premium amortization in 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had net purchase premiums on our Agency MBS of $213.3 million, or 3.8% of current par value, compared to net purchase premiums of $226.8 million, or 3.6% of par value at December 31, 2013.\n\nASSET ALLOCATION \n (4) Represents the sum of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances and securitized debt as a multiple of net equity allocated. The numerator of our Total Debt/Net Equity ratio also includes the obligation to return securities obtained as collateral of $507.4 million, and Senior Notes. \n (1) Excludes residential whole loans held at fair value which are reported as a component of non-interest-earning assets. \nSelected Financial Ratios\nPayments made and/or received on our Swaps are a component of our borrowing costs and accounted for interest expense of $53.8 million or 57 basis points, for 2015, compared to interest expense of $69.8 million, or 81 basis points, for 2014. The weighted average fixed-pay rate on our Swaps designated as hedges decreased to 1.86% for 2015 from 1.93% for 2014. The weighted average variable interest rate received on our Swaps increased to 0.19% for 2015 from 0.16% for 2014. During 2015, we did not enter into any new Swaps and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $710.2 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.96% amortize and/or expire.\nThe payments of principal and interest we receive on our Agency MBS, which depend directly upon payments on the mortgages underlying such securities, are guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are GSEs, but their guarantees are not explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. Ginnie Mae is part of a U.S. Government agency and its guarantees are explicitly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. We believe that the stronger backing for the guarantors of Agency MBS resulting from the conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac has further strengthened their credit worthiness; however, there can be no assurance that these actions will be adequate for their needs. Accordingly, if these government actions are inadequate and the GSEs suffer losses in the future or cease to exist, our view of the credit worthiness of our Agency MBS could materially change, which may affect our assessment of OTTI for Agency MBS in future periods. (See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors, The federal conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and related efforts, along with any changes in laws and regulations affecting the relationship between Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the U.S. Government, may materially adversely affect our business.\u201d)\n(2) Weighted average is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nNet Interest Income\nThe following table presents the components of the net interest spread earned on our Agency and Non-Agency MBS for the quarterly periods presented:\nOperating and Other Expense during 2015 also includes $10.4 million of loan servicing and other related operating expenses related to our residential whole loan activities. These expenses increased compared to the prior year period by approximately $7.0 million, consistent with the overall growth in this asset class during 2015. The overall increase is primarily due to loan servicing\n\nThe following table presents information regarding certain of our financial ratios at or for the dates presented:\nIn addition, we have elected to treat certain of our subsidiaries as a TRS. In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that we cannot hold or engage in directly and generally may engage in any real estate or non-real estate-related business. Generally, a TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. Since a portion of our business may be conducted through one or more TRS, our income earned by TRS may be subject to corporate income taxation. To maintain our REIT election, no more than 25% (or, for 2018 and subsequent taxable years, 20%) of the value of a REIT's assets at the end of each quarter may consist of stock or securities in a TRS. For purposes of the determination of U. S. federal and state income taxes, the Company's subsidiaries that elected to be treated as a TRS record current or deferred income taxes based on differences (both permanent and timing) between the determination of their taxable income and net income under GAAP. No deferred tax benefit was recorded by the Company in 2015 or 2014, as a valuation allowance for the full amount of the associated deferred tax asset was recognized as its recovery is not considered more likely than not.\nUnder the application of this accounting model we may aggregate into pools loans acquired in the same fiscal quarter that are assessed as having similar risk characteristics. For each pool established, or on an individual loans basis for loans not aggregated into pools, we estimate at acquisition and periodically on at least a quarterly basis, the principal and interest cash flows expected to be collected. The difference between the cash flows expected to be collected and the carrying amount of the loans is referred to as the accretable yield.\u201d This amount is accreted as interest income over the life of the loans using an effective interest rate (level yield) methodology. Interest income recorded each period reflects the amount of accretable yield recognized and not the coupon interest payments received on the underlying loans. The difference between contractually required principal and interest payments and the cash flows expected to be collected, referred to as the non-accretable difference,\u201d and includes estimates of both the effect of prepayments and expected credit losses over the life of the underlying loans.\nAt December 31, 2015, our CRT securities had an amortized cost of $186.3 million, a fair value of $183.6 million, a weighted average yield of 5.09% and weighted average time to maturity of 9.0 years.\nWe rely primarily on borrowings under repurchase agreements to finance our Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS. Our MBS have longer-term contractual maturities than our borrowings under repurchase agreements. Even though the majority of our MBS have interest rates that adjust over time based on short-term changes in corresponding interest rate indices (typically following an initial fixed-rate period for our Hybrids), the interest rates we pay on our borrowings will typically change at a faster pace than the interest rates we earn on our MBS. In order to reduce this interest rate risk exposure, we may enter into derivative instruments, which at December 31, 2015 were comprised of Swaps.\nCash received reflecting coupon payments on residential whole loans held at fair value is not included in Interest Income, but rather is presented in Net gain on residential whole loans held at fair value on our consolidated statements of operations.\n(1) We did not have any MBS with contractual maturities of less than one year at December 31, 2015.\nUnrealized losses on our Non-Agency MBS (including Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) were $28.4 million, of which $19.3 million were RPL/NPL MBS and $9.1 million were Legacy Non-Agency MBS at December 31, 2015. Based upon the most recent evaluation, we do not consider these unrealized losses to be indicative of OTTI and do not believe\n(6) Reflects total stockholders' equity less the preferred stock liquidation preference divided by total shares of common stock outstanding.\nThe determination of taxable income attributable to Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans is dependent on a number of factors, including principal payments, defaults, loss mitigation efforts and loss severities. In projecting taxable income for Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans during the year, management considers estimates of the amount of discount expected to be accreted. Such estimates require significant judgment and actual results may differ from these estimates. Moreover, the deductibility of realized losses from Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, and their effect on market discount accretion is analyzed on an asset-by-asset basis and while they will result in a reduction of taxable income, this reduction tends to occur gradually and primarily in periods after the realized losses are reported.\nIncome Taxes\nInterest income on the Non-Agency MBS that were purchased at a discount to par value and/or are considered to be of less than high credit quality is recognized based on the security's effective interest rate which is the security's IRR. The IRR is determined using management's estimate of the projected cash flows for each security, which are based on our observation of current information and events and include assumptions related to fluctuations in interest rates, prepayment speeds and the timing and amount of credit losses. On at least a quarterly basis, we review and, if appropriate, make adjustments to our cash flow projections based on input and analysis received from external sources, internal models, and our judgment about interest rates, prepayment rates, the timing and amount of credit losses, and other factors. Changes in cash flows from those originally projected, or from those estimated at the last evaluation, may result in a prospective change in the IRR/interest income recognized on these securities or in the recognition of OTTIs.\nThe following table presents certain quarterly information regarding our net interest spread and net interest margin for the quarterly periods presented:\n(6) Agency 3/1, 5/1, 7/1 and 10/1 Hybrid ARM-MBS with coupon greater than or equal to 4.5%.\nOther Income, net\nThe changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income\u201d and Interest Expense.\u201d\nMBS and CRT Securities\nInterest - Imputation of Interest - Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs\n (1) Represents for each counterparty the amount of cash and/or securities pledged as collateral less the aggregate of repurchase agreement financing and other advances, Swaps at fair value, and net interest receivable/payable on all such instruments. \n(6) MBS issued before June 2009.\nOTTI\nAs of December 31, 2015, approximately $7.449 billion, or 66.7%, of our MBS portfolio was in its contractual fixed-rate period or were fixed-rate MBS and approximately $3.723 billion, or 33.3%, was in its contractual adjustable-rate period, or were floating rate MBS with interest rates that reset monthly. Our ARM-MBS in their contractual adjustable-rate period primarily include MBS collateralized by Hybrids for which the initial fixed-rate period has elapsed, such that the interest rate will typically adjust on an annual or semiannual basis.\n (2) Excludes residential whole loans held at fair value that are reported as a component of total non-interest-earning assets. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires that numerous regulations, many of which (including those mentioned above regarding underwriting and mortgage originator compensation) have only recently been implemented and operationalized. As a result, we are unable to fully predict at this time how the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as other laws that may be adopted in the future, will affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, or the environment for repurchase financing and other forms of borrowing, the investing environment for Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and/or residential mortgage loans, the securitization industry, Swaps and other derivatives. However, at a minimum, we believe that the Dodd-Frank Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder are likely to continue to increase the economic and compliance costs for participants in the mortgage and securitization industries, including us.\nThe following table presents at December 31, 2015, the dollar amount of our residential whole loans at fair value, contractually maturing after one year, and indicates whether the loans have fixed interest rates or adjustable interest rates:\n\n (5) Includes $500.0 million of repurchase agreements entered into in connection with contemporaneous repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with a single counterparty \nGENERAL\n(2) Reflects annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS.\nPremiums arise when we acquire MBS at a price in excess of the principal balance of the mortgages securing such MBS (i.e., par value). Conversely, discounts arise when we acquire MBS at a price below the principal balance of the mortgages securing such MBS or acquire residential whole loans at a price below the principal balance of the mortgage. Premiums paid on our MBS are amortized against interest income and accretable purchase discounts on these investments are accreted to interest income. Purchase premiums on our MBS, which are primarily carried on our Agency MBS, are amortized against interest income over the life of each security using the effective yield method, adjusted for actual prepayment activity. An increase in the prepayment rate, as measured by the CPR, will typically accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums, thereby reducing the internal rate of return (or IRR)/interest income earned on such assets.\nOur borrowings under repurchase agreements are uncommitted and renewable at the discretion of our lenders and, as such, our lenders could determine to reduce or terminate our access to future borrowings at virtually any time. The terms of the repurchase transaction borrowings under our master repurchase agreements, as such terms relate to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities that are the subject of repurchase transactions, generally conform to the terms contained in the standard master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA or the global master repurchase agreement published by SIFMA and the International Capital Market Association. In addition, each lender typically requires that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions, which differ by lender, may include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, required haircuts (as defined below), purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default and setoff provisions.\n\nFor tax purposes, depending on the transaction structure, a resecuritization transaction may be treated either as a sale or a financing of the underlying MBS. Income recognized from resecuritization transactions will differ for tax and GAAP. For tax purposes, we own and may in the future acquire interests in resecuritization trusts, in which several of the classes of securities are or will be issued with Original Issue Discount (or OID). As the holder of the retained interests in the trust, we generally will be required to include OID in our current gross interest income over the term of the applicable securities as the OID accrues. The rate at which the OID is recognized into taxable income is calculated using a constant rate of yield to maturity, with realized losses impacting the amount of OID recognized in REIT taxable income once they are actually incurred. For tax purposes, REIT taxable income may be recognized in excess of economic income (i.e., OID) or in advance of the corresponding cash flow from these assets, thereby effecting our dividend distribution requirement to stockholders.\nResidential whole loans included in our consolidated balance sheets are generally comprised of pools of fixed and adjustable rate residential mortgage loans acquired through consolidated trusts in secondary market transactions at discounted purchase prices. The accounting model utilized by us is determined at the time each loan package is initially acquired and is generally based on the delinquency status of the majority of the underlying borrowers in the package at acquisition. The accounting model described below under Residential Whole Loans at Carrying Value\u201d is typically utilized by us for loans where the underlying borrower has a delinquency status of less than 60 days at the acquisition date. The accounting model described below under Residential Whole Loans at Fair Value\u201d is typically utilized by us for loans where the underlying borrower has a delinquency status of 60 days or more at the acquisition date. The accounting model initially applied is not subsequently changed.\nPurchase Discounts on Non-Agency MBS and Securities Underlying Linked Transactions\nFair Value Measurements\nIn addition to the regulatory actions being implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act, on August 31, 2011, the SEC issued a concept release under which it is reviewing interpretive issues related to Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(5)(C) excludes from the definition of investment company\u201d entities that are primarily engaged in, among other things, purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.\u201d Many companies that engage in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments seek to rely on existing interpretations of the SEC Staff with respect to Section 3(c)(5)(C) so as not to be deemed an investment company for the purpose of regulation under the Investment Company Act. In connection with the concept release, the SEC requested comments on, among other things, whether it should reconsider its existing interpretation of Section 3(c)(5)(C). To date the SEC has not taken or otherwise announced any further action in connection with the concept release. (For additional discussion of the SEC's concept release and its potential impact on us, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nDecember 31, 2015\nThe table below summarizes our exposure to our counterparties at December 31, 2015, by country of domicile:\n\n (3) Includes one counterparty that is a central clearing house for our Swaps. \nInformation About Our Assets\nThe weighted average haircut requirements for the respective underlying collateral types for our repurchase agreements have not significantly changed since December 31, 2014, with the exception of Residential whole loans and Legacy Non-Agency MBS. During 2015, the Company has increased the number of counterparties providing repurchase agreement financing for residential whole loans resulting in a lower overall weighted average haircut. The decrease in the weighted average haircut for Legacy Non-Agency MBS results from the unwind during 2015 of certain re-securitization transactions and subsequent refinancing of the underlying MBS at lower haircut levels.\nOperating and Other Expense for 2014 also included a $1.2 million accrual of interest with respect to prior years undistributed taxable income. No such expense was incurred in 2015.\nfinancing activities and is managed based on our anticipated cash needs. (See Interest Rate Risk\u201d included under\nLevel 3 - inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement.\nGeneral\n (3) Includes cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, securities obtained and pledged as collateral, CRT securities, interest receivable, goodwill, prepaid and other assets, obligation to return securities obtained as collateral of $507.4 million, interest payable, dividends payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities. \n(2) Does not reflect $2.626 billion of RPL/NPL MBS, which are re-performing deals with both fixed rate and hybrid re-performing loans. These deal structures contain a coupon step-up of 300 basis points at 36 months or sooner from issuance.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nWe discontinue hedge accounting on a prospective basis and recognize changes in the fair value of the derivative through earnings when: (i) it is determined that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting cash flows of a hedged item (including forecasted transactions); (ii) it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur; or (iii) it is determined that designating the derivative as a hedge is no longer appropriate.\n\nThe results of our business operations are affected by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets, which is driven by numerous factors, including the supply and demand for residential mortgage assets in the marketplace, the terms and availability of adequate financing, general economic and real estate conditions (both on a national and local level), the impact of government actions in the real estate and mortgage sector, and the credit performance of our credit sensitive residential mortgage assets. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS, the behavior of which involves various risks and uncertainties. Interest rates and conditional prepayment rates (or CPRs) (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nAt December 31, 2015, $4.752 billion, or 42.5% of our MBS portfolio was invested in Agency MBS. During the year ended 2015, the fair value of our Agency MBS decreased by $1.152 billion. This was due to $1.059 billion of principal repayments,$41.2 million of premium amortization and a $51.3 million decrease in net unrealized gains.\n(6) Excluded the special common stock dividend declared on August 1, 2013.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS TO BE ADOPTED IN FUTURE PERIODS\n(3) Weighted average months to reset is the number of months remaining before the coupon interest rate resets. At reset, the MBS coupon will adjust based upon the underlying benchmark interest rate index, margin and periodic or lifetime caps. The months to reset do not reflect scheduled amortization or prepayments.\n (5) Net interest rate spread reflects the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. \nWe finance a significant portion of our MBS and CRT securities with repurchase agreements and other advances. In connection with these financing arrangements, we pledge our securities as collateral to secure the borrowing. The amount of collateral pledged will typically exceed the amount of the financing with the extent of over-collateralization ranging from 1%-6% of the amount borrowed (U.S. Treasury and Agency MBS collateral) to up to 64% (Non-Agency MBS collateral). Consequently, while repurchase agreement financing results in us recording a liability to the counterparty in our consolidated balance sheets, we are exposed to the counterparty, if during the term of the repurchase agreement financing, a lender should default on its obligation and we are not able to recover our pledged assets. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral.\nDuring 2015, the financial market environment was impacted by continued accommodative monetary policy. Repurchase agreement funding for both Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS has been available to us at generally attractive market terms from multiple counterparties. Typically, due to the credit risk inherent to Non-Agency MBS, repurchase agreement funding involving Non-Agency MBS is available from fewer counterparties, at terms requiring higher collateralization and higher interest rates, than repurchase agreement funding secured by Agency MBS and U.S. Treasury securities. Therefore, we generally expect to be able to finance our acquisitions of Agency MBS on more favorable terms than financing for Non-Agency MBS.\n(1) Together with coupon interest, accretable purchase discount is recognized as interest income over the life of the security.\nResults of Operations\n (2) Reflected annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nFor 2015, we had compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expense of $42.0 million, or 1.34% of average equity, compared to $40.7 million, or 1.26% of average equity, for 2014. Compensation and benefits expense increased $712,000 to $26.3 million for 2015, compared to $25.6 million for 2014, primarily reflecting higher costs associated with our wider residential asset strategy. Our other general and administrative expenses increased by $588,000 to $15.8 million for 2015 compared to $15.2 million for 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher IT development and related costs, data analytics and pricing services related expenses and costs associated with our attaining FHLB membership, partially offset by lower professional services related costs.\nDuring 2015, we continued to invest in residential mortgage assets, including both MBS and, through consolidated trusts, residential whole loans. At December 31, 2015, our MBS portfolio was approximately $11.173 billion compared to $12.573 billion (including $1.913 billion MBS reported as components of Linked Transactions) at December 31, 2014.\nOn May 16, 2013, we redeemed all 3,840,000 outstanding shares of our Series A Preferred Stock at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $97.0 million, or $25.27153 per share, including all accrued and unpaid dividends to the Redemption Date. The redemption value of the Series A Preferred Stock exceeded its carrying value by $3.9 million, which represents the original offering costs for the Series A Preferred Stock.\n\nThe following table presents information regarding certain of our financial ratios at or for the dates presented:\n(1) Includes loans on which borrowers have defaulted and are not making payments of principal and/or interest as of December 31, 2015.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern (or ASU 2014-15). The amendments in this ASU provide guidance in GAAP about management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is a substantial doubt about an entity's going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). The amendments in ASU 2014-15 are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. We do not expect adoption of ASU 2014-15 to have a significant impact on our financial position or financial statement disclosures.\n(5) Represents the sum of borrowings under repurchase agreements, FHLB advances, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, and obligations to return securities obtained as collateral and Senior Notes divided by stockholders' equity. The increase in our leverage multiple for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 from the quarter ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of $1.520 billion of repurchase agreements previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions.\nFor 2014, our net interest spread and margin were 2.40% and 2.78%, respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 2.32% and 2.70%, respectively, for 2013. Although our net interest spread and margin increased, our net interest income decreased by $14.9 million, or 4.7%, to $304.0 million from $318.9 million for 2013. This decrease primarily reflected the impact of the lower average balance of our MBS portfolio as measured by amortized cost, increased Non-Agency MBS borrowing costs (including the impact of allocated Swap expense), partially offset by higher yielding Non-Agency MBS due to improved credit performance, a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt and lower Agency MBS borrowing costs. It should be noted that our reported net interest income for 2014 and 2013 excluded the interest income on Non-Agency MBS and CRT securities and the interest expense on repurchase agreements financings that had been accounted for as Linked Transactions and for which the net interest income was reported in Other income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. For 2014, the net interest earned on our investments accounted for as Linked Transactions increased by approximately $13.5 million to $16.4 million compared to $2.9 million for 2013. The net interest spread on our Agency MBS portfolio declined slightly to 1.08% for 2014 compared to 1.09% for 2013. The net interest spread on our Non-Agency MBS portfolio increased to 4.70% for 2014 compared to 4.55% for 2013.\n(2) Includes discount designated as Credit Reserve of $877.6 million and OTTI of $23.0 million.\nFor 2014, Other income, net, increased by $33.0 million to $54.8 million from $21.8 million for 2013. In 2014 Other income, net primarily reflected $37.5 million of net gains realized on the sale of certain Non-Agency MBS and unrealized net gains and net interest income of $17.1 million on our Linked Transactions. In addition, during 2014 we recorded net gains on residential whole loans held at fair value of $116,000, primarily reflecting changes in market value of the underlying loans since acquisition. During 2014, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $123.9 million, realizing gross gains of $37.5 million. During 2013, we sold Non-Agency MBS for $152.6 million, and realized gross gains of $25.8 million and sold U.S. Treasury securities for $422.2 million, realizing net losses of approximately $24,000. The unrealized net gains and net interest income from Linked Transactions of $17.1 million for 2014 included interest income of $24.4 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $8.0 million on the borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $677,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. The unrealized net gains and net interest income on Linked Transactions of $3.2 million for 2013 included interest income of $3.9 million on the underlying Non-Agency MBS, interest expense of $925,000 on borrowings under repurchase agreements and an increase of $281,000 in the fair value of the underlying securities. During 2014, certain of our Linked Transactions became unlinked, resulting in our recording Non-Agency MBS with a fair value of $86.4 million on our consolidated balance sheets. The $7.5 million of losses realized on TBA short positions for 2013 reflected losses on the sale of $350.0 million notional of TBA securities.\nWe expense our equity-based compensation awards that are subject to vesting conditions, ratably over the vesting period of such awards, based upon the fair value of such awards at the grant date. Compensation expense for equity-based awards is recorded net of estimated forfeitures expected to occur over the vesting period. (See Notes 2(l) and 15 to the consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nInterest income on our Non-Agency MBS (which includes Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs) decreased $10.4 million, or 3.2%, for 2014 to $316.3 million compared to $326.8 million for 2013, primarily due to the decrease in the amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS portfolio, partially offset by the increase in the net yield on our Non-Agency MBS portfolio. For 2014, the average amortized cost of our Non-Agency MBS (excluding Non-Agency MBS reported as a component of Linked Transactions) decreased by $399.2 million or 8.9%, to $4.108 billion, from $4.508 billion for 2013. Our Non-Agency MBS portfolio yielded 7.70% for 2014 compared to 7.25% for 2013. The increase in the yield on our Non-Agency MBS was primarily due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the then current and prior year, that had occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. During 2014, we recognized net purchase discount accretion of $103.4 million on our Non-Agency MBS, compared to $73.2 million for 2013. At December 31, 2014, we had net purchase discounts of $1.300 billion, including Credit Reserve and previously recognized OTTI of $900.6 million, on our Non-Agency MBS, or 24.4% of par value. During 2014 we reallocated $95.0 million of purchased discount designated as Credit Reserve to accretable purchase discount.\n\nWe determine the fair value of our Agency MBS, based upon prices obtained from third-party pricing services, which are indicative of market activity and repurchase agreement counterparties.\nIt is our business strategy to hold our MBS as long-term investments. On at least a quarterly basis, we assess our ability and intent to continue to hold each security and, as part of this process, we monitor our securities for other-than-temporary impairment. A change in our ability and/or intent to continue to hold any of our securities that are in an unrealized loss position, or a deterioration in the underlying characteristics of these securities, could result in our recognizing future impairment charges or a loss upon the sale of any such security. At December 31, 2015, we had net unrealized gains of $28.8 million on our Agency MBS, comprised of gross unrealized gains of $69.2 million and gross unrealized losses of $40.4 million, and net unrealized gains on our Non-Agency MBS of $559.0 million, comprised of gross unrealized gains of $587.3 million and gross unrealized losses of $28.4 million. At December 31, 2015, we did not intend to sell any of our MBS that were in an unrealized loss position, and we believe it is more likely than not that we will not be required to sell those securities before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be at their maturity.\nOther Income, net\n(1) Reflects the annualized coupon interest income divided by the average amortized cost. The discounted purchase price on Legacy Non-Agency MBS causes the coupon yield to be higher than the pass-through coupon interest rate.\n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable in the amount of $1.0 million.\nInterest Expense\nWith respect to margin maintenance requirements for repurchase agreements with Non-Agency MBS as collateral, margin calls are typically determined by our counterparties based on their assessment of changes in the fair value of the underlying collateral and in accordance with the agreed upon haircuts specified in the transaction confirmation with the counterparty. We address margin call requests in accordance with the required terms specified in the applicable repurchase agreement and such requests are typically satisfied by posting additional cash or collateral on the same business day. We review margin calls made by counterparties and assess them for reasonableness by comparing the counterparty valuation against our valuation determination. When we believe that a margin call is unnecessary because our assessment of collateral value differs from the counterparty valuation, we typically hold discussions with the counterparty and are able to resolve the matter. In the unlikely event that resolution cannot be reached, we will look to resolve the dispute based on the remedies available to us under the terms of the repurchase agreement, which in some instances may include the engagement of a third party to review collateral valuations. For other agreements that do not include such provisions, we could resolve the matter by substituting collateral as permitted in accordance with the agreement or otherwise request the counterparty to return the collateral in exchange for cash to unwind the financing.\n (6) Net interest margin reflects net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nFor 2015, our net interest spread and margin were 2.33% and 2.65%, respectively, compared to a net interest spread and margin of 2.40% and 2.78%, respectively, for 2014. Our net interest income increased by $11.2 million, or 3.7%, to $315.2 million from $304.0 million for 2014. For 2015, net interest income on RPL/NPL MBS and CRT securities increased by approximately\n (2) Reflects annualized net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. \nIn addition, we use interest rate Swaps to manage interest rate risk exposure in connection with our repurchase agreement financings. We will make cash payments or pledge securities as collateral as part of a margin arrangement in connection with interest rate Swaps that are in an unrealized loss position. In the event that a counterparty for a Swap that is not subject to central clearing were to default on its obligation, we would be exposed to a loss to a Swap counterparty to the extent that the amount of cash or securities pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated Swaps and we were not able to recover the excess collateral.\n(1) Does not include principal payments receivable of $1.0 million and $542,000 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe estimate that for 2015, our taxable income was approximately $307.5 million. Based on dividends paid or declared during 2015, we have undistributed taxable income of approximately $7.6 million, or $0.02 per share. We have until the filing of our 2015 tax return (due not later than September 15, 2016) to declare the distribution of any 2015 REIT taxable income not previously distributed.\nCertain events that are expected to occur over the next few quarters are anticipated to impact the amount of taxable income generated, including (i) the unwind of a resecuritization transaction, which is currently expected to generate taxable income of approximately $0.19 per share, and (ii) the receipt of our share of settlement proceeds in connection with the $8.5 billion settlement of the Bank of America/Countrywide MBS litigation, which is expected to generate taxable income of approximately $0.05 per share.\n\nCongress may continue to consider legislation that would significantly reform the country's mortgage finance system, including, among other things, eliminating Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae and replacing them with a single new MBS insurance agency. Many details remain unsettled, including the scope and costs of the agencies's guarantee and their affordable housing mission, some of which could be addressed even in the absence of large-scale reform. While the likelihood of enactment of major mortgage finance system reform in the short term remains uncertain, it is possible that the adoption of any such reforms could adversely affect the types of assets we can buy, the costs of these assets and our business operations. As the FHFA and both houses of Congress continue to consider various measures intended to dramatically restructure the U.S. housing finance system and the operations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we expect debate and discussion on the topic to continue throughout 2016.\nResidential Whole Loans at Carrying Value\nInterest Income\nTax Considerations\n\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n(1) Reflected annualized net income available to common stock and participating securities divided by average total assets.\n (3) Reflects the difference between the net yield on average MBS and average cost of funds on MBS. \nSelected Financial Ratios\n\nResidential Whole Loans, at Fair Value\n(4) Reflects dividends declared per share of common stock divided by earnings per share.\nFor 2014, we had compensation and benefits and other general and administrative expense of $40.7 million, or 1.26% of average equity, compared to $33.7 million, or 1.03% of average equity, for 2013. The $5.3 million increase in our compensation and benefits expense to $25.6 million for 2014, compared to $20.3 million for 2013, primarily reflected increases in equity-based compensation expense, salary and bonus expense, and payroll taxes. Our other general and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million to $15.2 million for 2014 compared to $13.4 million for 2013. The increase was primarily comprised of increases in professional services, board of director expenses and the cost of data and analytical systems.\nThe changes in average interest-earning assets and average interest-bearing liabilities and their related yields and costs are discussed in greater detail below under Interest Income\u201d and Interest Expense.\u201d\n(5) Reflected total stockholders' equity less the preferred stock liquidation preference divided by total shares of common stock outstanding.\nIn July 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MFA Insurance became a member of the FHLB. As a member of the FHLB, MFA Insurance had access to a variety of products and services offered by the FHLB, including secured advances (subject to our continued creditworthiness, pledging of sufficient eligible collateral to secure advances, and compliance with certain agreements with the FHLB). The weighted average haircut on our FHLB advances at December 31, 2015 was 7.00%. However, in January, 2016, the FHFA amended its regulation on FHLB membership, which, among other things, provided termination rules for current captive insurance members. As a result, MFA Insurance will not be permitted new advances or renewal of existing advances and will be required to terminate its FHLB membership and repay any outstanding advances by no later than February 19, 2017. As of December 31, 2015 and February 16, 2016, MFA Insurance had approximately $1.500 billion and $1.200 billion, respectively, in outstanding advances (backed by Agency MBS).\nDuring 2015 we recognized OTTI charges through earnings of $705,000 against certain of our Non-Agency MBS. These impairment charges reflected changes in our estimated cash flows for such securities based on an updated assessment of the estimated future performance of the underlying collateral, including the expected principal loss over the term of the securities and changes in the expected timing of receipt of cash flows. We did not recognize any OTTI charges through earnings against our Non-Agency MBS during 2014. At December 31, 2015, we had 336 Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $40.4 million, 59 RPL/NPL MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $19.3 million and 58 Legacy Non-Agency MBS with a gross unrealized loss of $9.1 million. Impairments on Agency MBS in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2015 are considered temporary and not credit related. Unrealized losses on Non-Agency MBS for which no OTTI was recorded during the year are considered temporary based on an assessment of changes in the expected cash flows for such securities, which considers recent bond performance and expected future performance of the underlying collateral. Significant judgment is used both in our analysis of expected cash flows for our Legacy Non-Agency MBS and any determination of the credit component of OTTI. (See Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d for more information regarding OTTI.)\nWe are exposed to credit risk in our Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, generally meaning that we are subject to credit losses in these portfolios that correspond to the risk of delinquency, default and foreclosure on the underlying real estate collateral. (See Part I, Item 1A., Risk Factors - Credit Risks\u201d, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), We believe the discounted purchase prices paid on certain of these investments mitigates our risk of loss in the event that, as we expect on most such investments, we receive less than 100% of the par value of these securities or loans. Our investment process for credit sensitive assets involves analysis focused primarily on quantifying and pricing credit risk.\nGross unrealized losses on our Agency MBS were $40.4 million at December 31, 2015. Agency MBS are issued by GSEs and enjoy either the implicit or explicit backing of the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. While our Agency MBS are not rated by any rating agency, they are currently perceived by market participants to be of high credit quality, with risk of default limited to the unlikely event that the U.S. Government would not continue to support the GSEs. Given the credit quality inherent in Agency MBS, we do not consider any of the current impairments on our Agency MBS to be credit related. In assessing whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell any impaired security before its anticipated recovery, which may be at its maturity, we consider for each impaired security, the significance of each investment, the amount of impairment, the projected future performance of such impaired securities, as well as our current and anticipated leverage capacity and liquidity position. Based on these analyses, we determined that at December 31, 2015 any unrealized losses on our Agency MBS were temporary.\n (1) Reflected the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. \nExposure to Financial Counterparties\n\n\n (1) Reflects annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS. \n(3) Reflects total average stockholders' equity divided by total average assets. The decrease for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 compared to the quarter ended December 31, 2014 is primarily due to the reclassification of $1.918 billion of MBS previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions.\nHedging Activities\nConsolidation - Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis\nor other developments and by monitoring the amount of cash and securities collateral pledged and the associated loan amount under repurchase agreements and/or the fair value of Swaps with our counterparties. We intend to make reverse margin calls on our counterparties to recover excess collateral as permitted by the agreements governing our financing arrangements, or take other necessary actions to reduce the amount of our exposure to a counterparty when such actions are considered necessary.\nRepurchase agreement funding for both Agency MBS and Non-Agency MBS continues to be available to us from multiple counterparties. Typically, repurchase agreement funding involving Non-Agency MBS is available from fewer counterparties, at terms requiring higher collateralization and higher interest rates, than for repurchase agreement funding involving Agency MBS. In July 2015, our wholly-owned subsidiary, MFA Insurance, became a member of the FHLB of Des Moines, further diversifying our potential sources of funding for residential mortgage investments. However, in January, 2016, the FHFA released its final rule amending its regulation on FHLB membership, which, amongst other things, provided termination rules for current captive insurance members. As a result of such regulation, MFA Insurance will not be permitted new advances or renewal of existing advances and will be required to terminate its FHLB membership within one year of the rule's effective date of February 19, 2016. At December 31, 2015, our debt consisted of borrowings under repurchase agreements with 27 counterparties, FHLB advances, securitized debt, Senior Notes outstanding and obligation to return securities obtained as collateral, resulting in a debt-to-equity multiple of 3.4 times. (See table on page 55 under Results of Operations that presents our quarterly leverage multiples since March 31, 2014.)\n (3) Includes average interest-earning cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. \nIn addition to our investments in Agency MBS, Non-Agency MBS and residential whole loans, we invest in CRT securities, which are debt obligations issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. At December 31, 2015, our investments in these securities totaled $183.6 million.\nThe following table presents information about our securitized debt at December 31, 2014:\nAt the end of 2015, the average coupon on mortgages underlying our Agency MBS was lower compared to the end of 2014, due to prepayments on higher yielding assets and downward resets on Hybrid and ARM-MBS within the portfolio. As a result, the coupon yield on our Agency MBS portfolio declined 18 basis points to 2.78% for 2015 from 2.96% for 2014. The net Agency MBS yield decreased to 2.00% for 2015, from 2.23% for 2014. The net yield for our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio was 7.62% for 2015 compared to 7.74% for 2014. The decrease in the net yield on our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio is primarily due to prepayments on higher yielding assets in the portfolio, partially offset by increases in accretable discount due to the impact of credit reserve releases, in the current and prior year, that have occurred as a result of the improved credit performance of loans underlying the Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio. The net yield for our RPL/NPL MBS portfolio was 3.68% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 3.69% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In the comparable prior period, the majority of our RPL/NPL MBS were reported as Linked Transactions.\nWhen the fair value of an AFS security is less than its amortized cost at the balance sheet date, the security is considered impaired. We assess our impaired securities on at least a quarterly basis and designate such impairments as either temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary.\u201d If we intend to sell an impaired security, or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the impaired security before its anticipated recovery, then we must recognize an OTTI through charges to earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not expect to sell an other-than-temporarily impaired security, only the portion of the OTTI related to credit losses is recognized through charges to earnings with the remainder recognized through AOCI on the consolidated balance sheets.\n (1) Yields presented throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K are calculated using average amortized cost data for securities which excludes unrealized gains and losses and includes principal payments receivable on securities. For GAAP reporting purposes, purchases and sales are reported on the trade date. Average amortized cost data used to determine yields is calculated based on the settlement date of the associated purchase or sale as interest income is not earned on purchased assets and continues to be earned on sold assets until settlement date. Includes Non-Agency MBS transferred to consolidated VIEs. \n (2) The carrying value of such loans reflects the purchase price, accretion of income, cash received and provision for loan losses since acquisition. At December 31, 2015, the fair value of such loans is estimated to be $289.7 million. \nActual maturities of MBS are generally shorter than stated contractual maturities because actual maturities of MBS are affected by the contractual lives of the underlying mortgage loans, periodic payments of principal, and prepayments of principal. The following table presents certain information regarding the amortized costs, weighted average yields and contractual maturities of our MBS at December 31, 2015 and does not reflect the effect of prepayments or scheduled principal amortization on our MBS:\nThe fair value of U.S. Treasury securities obtained as collateral and the associated obligation to return securities obtained as collateral are based upon prices obtained from a third-party pricing service, which are indicative of market activity. Securities obtained as collateral are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy.\nWe believe that we operate in, and intend to continue to operate in, a manner that allows and will continue to allow us to be taxed as a REIT. Provided that we distribute all of our REIT taxable income (including net long-term capital gains) to stockholders in the timeframe permitted by the Code, we do not generally expect to pay corporate level taxes and/or excise taxes. However, such taxes may arise from time to time in the normal course of our business. Many of the REIT requirements, however, are highly technical and complex. In addition, REIT taxable income calculated at the time our financial statements are prepared is based on certain estimates that may be revised as our tax return, which is not required to be filed until September in the following year, is completed. If we were to fail to meet certain of the REIT requirements, we would be subject to U.S. federal, state and local income taxes.\nA financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nAt December 31, 2015, $6.421 billion, or 57.5% of our MBS portfolios was invested in Non-Agency MBS. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the fair value of our Non-Agency MBS holdings increased by $1.665 billion. The primary components of the change during the year in these Non-Agency MBS include the reclassification of $1.913 billion of Non-Agency MBS that were previously reported as a component of Linked Transactions and $1.734 billion of purchases (at a weighted average purchase price of 99.9%). Partially offsetting these increases were $1.845 billion of principal repayments and other principal reductions, a decrease reflecting Non-Agency MBS price changes of $66.3 million and the sale of Non-Agency MBS with a fair value of $70.8 million.\n\nOperating and Other Expense\n(2) Reflected annualized interest income on MBS divided by average amortized cost of MBS.\nWe maintain cash and cash equivalents, unpledged Agency and Non-Agency MBS and collateral in excess of margin requirements held by our counterparties (or collectively, cash and other unpledged collateral\u201d) to meet routine margin calls and protect against unforeseen reductions in our borrowing capabilities. Our ability to meet future margin calls will be impacted by our ability to use cash or obtain financing from unpledged collateral, which can vary based on the market value of such collateral, our cash position and margin requirements. Our cash position fluctuates based on the timing of our operating, investing and\nAt December 31, 2015, we had repurchase agreement borrowings of $7.889 billion of which $3.050 billion was hedged with Swaps, FHLB advances of $1.500 billion and securitized debt of $22.1 million. At December 31, 2015, our Swaps designated in hedging relationships had a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.82% and extended 45 months on average with a maximum remaining term of approximately 92 months.\nLevel 1 - inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance) vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nRecent Market Conditions and Our Strategy\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nYear Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nNon-Agency MBS\nResidential Whole Loans\nOur interest expense for 2014 decreased by $4.2 million, or 2.6% to $159.8 million, from $164.0 million for 2013. This decrease primarily reflected a decrease in the average balance of securitized debt, a decrease in our average borrowings to finance Agency MBS and the lower effective interest rate paid on borrowings to finance Agency MBS, which was partially offset by higher effective funding costs associated with Non-Agency MBS, including allocated Swap financing costs, and securitized debt.\n(3) Reflected total average stockholders' equity divided by total average assets.\n (1) Reflects the difference between the yield on average interest-earning assets and average cost of funds. \nOur residential whole loans pledged as collateral against repurchase agreements are included in the consolidated balance sheets with the fair value of the loans pledged disclosed parenthetically. Purchases and sales of residential whole loans are recorded on the trade date, with amounts recorded reflecting management's current estimate of assets that will be acquired or disposed at the closing of the transaction. This estimate is subject to revision at the closing of the transaction, pending the outcome of due diligence performed prior to closing.\nThe following table presents certain information regarding our 15-year fixed-rate Agency MBS as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\n(2) The Non-GAAP Leverage Multiple reflected the sum of our borrowings under repurchase agreements, securitized debt, payable for unsettled MBS purchases, obligations to return securities obtained as collateral, Senior Notes and borrowings that were reported on our consolidated balance sheets as a component of Linked Transactions of $1.520 billion, $791.8 million, $387.5 million, $206.0 million, $102.7 million, $82.4 million, $33.2 million and $34.1 million at December 31, 2014, September 30, 2014, June 30, 2014, March 31, 2014, December 31, 2013, September 30, 2013, June 30, 2013 and March 31, 2013 respectively. We presented a Non-GAAP leverage multiple since repurchase agreement borrowings that were a component of Linked Transactions may not be linked in the future and, if no longer linked, would be reported as repurchase agreement borrowings, which would increase our leverage multiple. (See Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, included under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.)\nDecember 31, 2015\nOur consolidated financial statements include our accounts and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries. In addition, we consolidate the special purpose entities (or SPEs) created to facilitate the resecuritization transactions completed in prior years and the acquisition of residential whole loans. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management has made estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements, giving due consideration to materiality. Application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates.\n(3) Includes discount designated as Credit Reserve of $893.1 million and OTTI of $23.0 million.\n(4) Interest only represents MBS backed by mortgages currently in their interest only period. Percentage is based on MBS current face at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe following table presents certain information regarding our Hybrid Agency MBS as of December 31, 2015 and 2014:\nThe following table sets forth certain information about the average balances of our assets and liabilities and their related yields and costs for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013. Average yields are derived by dividing interest income by the average amortized cost of the related assets, and average costs are derived by dividing interest expense by the daily average balance of the related liabilities, for the periods shown. The yields and costs include premium amortization and purchase discount accretion which are considered adjustments to interest rates.\nFor 2015, our net income available to our common stock and participating securities was $298.2 million, or $0.80 per basic and diluted common share, relatively unchanged compared to net income available to common stock and participating securities for 2014 of $298.5 million, or $0.81 per basic and diluted common share.\nGeneral\n\nThe effective interest rate paid on our borrowings decreased to 1.81% for 2015 from 1.84% for 2014. This decrease reflects the lower average balance of Agency repurchase agreements and securitized debt, the lower financing rates associated with our Legacy Non-Agency MBS portfolio (including the allocation of Swap expense), partially offset by the increase in our average balance of repurchase agreements used to finance RPL/NPL MBS.\nRate/Volume Analysis\nA decrease in expected cash flows in subsequent periods may indicate impairment at the pool and/or individual loan level thus requiring the establishment of an allowance for loan losses by a charge to the provision for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses represents the present value of cash flows expected at acquisition, adjusted for any increases due to changes in estimated cash flows that are subsequently no longer expected to be received at the relevant measurement date. A significant increase in expected cash flows in subsequent periods first reduces any previously recognized allowance for loan losses and then will result in a recalculation in the amount of accretable yield. The adjustment of accretable yield due to a significant increase in expected cash flows is accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate and results in reclassification from non-accretable difference to accretable yield.\nOur Swap derivative instruments are designated as cash-flow hedges against a portion of our current and forecasted LIBOR-based repurchase agreements. Our Swaps do not extend the maturities of our repurchase agreements; they do, however, lock in a fixed rate of interest over their term for the notional amount of the Swap corresponding to the hedged item. During 2015, we did not enter into any new Swaps and had Swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $710.2 million and a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.96% amortize and/or expire. At December 31, 2015, we had Swaps designated in hedging relationships with an aggregate notional amount of $3.050 billion with a weighted average fixed-pay rate of 1.82% and a weighted average variable interest rate received of 0.34%.\n (1) Represents private-label MBS issued in 2013, 2014 and 2015 in which the underlying collateral consists of re-performing/non-performing loans that were originated in prior years. Included with the balance of Non-Agency MBS reported on our consolidated balance sheets. \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis (or ASU 2015-02). The amendments in this ASU change the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether (a) they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities, (b) fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a VIE, and (c) variable interests in a VIE held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the VIE. It also eliminates the VIE consolidation model based on majority exposure to variability that applied to certain investment companies and similar entities. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. At the effective date, all previous consolidation analyses that the guidance affects must be reconsidered. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity adopts the amendments in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this ASU using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the effect that ASU 2015-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. While we have not yet selected a transition method, we do not expect adoption of ASU 2015-2 to have a significant impact on our financial position.\nWe determine the fair value of our residential whole loans held at fair value after considering portfolio valuations obtained from a third-party who specializes in providing valuations of residential mortgage loans and trading activity observed in the market place. The Company's residential whole loans held at fair value are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\nNet interest income represents the difference between income on interest-earning assets and expense on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest income depends primarily upon the volume of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities and the corresponding interest rates earned or paid. Our net interest income varies primarily as a result of changes in interest rates, the slope of the yield curve (i.e., the differential between long-term and short-term interest rates), borrowing costs (i.e., our interest expense) and prepayment speeds on our MBS. Interest rates and CPRs (which measure the amount of unscheduled principal prepayment on a bond as a percentage of the bond balance), vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nIncome on residential whole loans at carrying value is recognized based on pools of assets with similar credit risk characteristics using an estimated yield based on cash flows expected to be collected over the lives of the loans in such pools rather than the contractual coupons of the underlying loans. As the unit of account is at the pool level rather than the individual loan level, none of our residential whole loans at carrying value are currently considered 90 days or more past due.\n\nThe
