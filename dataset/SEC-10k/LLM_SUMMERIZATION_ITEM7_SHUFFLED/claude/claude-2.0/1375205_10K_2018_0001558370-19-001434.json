MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nBusiness Overview\nThe following discussion is designed to provide information that we believe necessary for an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nIndustry Update and Trends\nThe uranium industry continues to be characterized by persistently low pricing, and threats to pricing and market stability created by foreign state-sponsored producers. In 2018, several uranium miners, including Lost Creek ISR, LLC, implemented decisions to halt planned construction and development as well as to operate at lower rates of production. Cameco's November 2017 announcement to suspend production at McArthur River, the world's largest uranium mine, for at least ten months in 2018, was emblematic of the conditions of the global market. Subsequently, in July 2018, Cameco confirmed that it would extend the planned 10-month production suspension of this operation for an indeterminate duration. Numerous other mines worldwide have announced cuts in production and/or plans to shut down production operations in the near term.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this report, we completed the development of the third header house in Lost Creek's second mine unit, while continuing to control annual production rates at a modest target of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds. Production at Lost Creek in 2018 totaled 302,164 pounds captured in the plant. While U.S. miners lowered production rates and halted development ensuring near-term production will remain lower, imports continued to dominate the U.S. market in 2018. Projections at year end suggest that U.S. uranium miners accounted for less than two percent of domestic uranium needs.\nIn response to the challenges of the market conditions, primary among them foreign imports into the U.S. emanating from state-sponsored producers in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, on January 16, 2018, Ur-Energy USA and Energy Fuels Resources (USA) Inc. (Energy Fuels) initiated a trade action with the U.S. Department of Commerce pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. We chose this statutory framework for relief because we recognized that the current imbalance in the U.S. uranium market has created a very real threat to our national security.\nThe Petition for Relief with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) From Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten U.S. National Security ( Petition\u201d) describes how uranium and nuclear fuel from state-owned and state-subsidized enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China represent a threat to U.S. national security. The Petition seeks a remedy which will set a quota to limit imports of uranium into the U.S. by reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. Additionally, the Petition suggests implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the Administration's Buy American Policy.\nOn July 18, 2018, DOC announced it initiated an investigation into whether the present quantity and circumstances of uranium ore and product imports into the United States threaten to impair national security.\u201d Thereafter, the DOC announced a public comment period which subsequently closed on September 25, 2018. Other aspects of the investigation are proceeding; the DOC investigation must be complete by April 15, 2019. Thereafter, the President has 90 days (until July 15, 2019) to act on the DOC's recommendations and, if\nnecessary, to act to adjust the imports\u201d and/or pursue other lawful, non-trade related actions necessary to address the import threat.\nThere can be no certainty of the outcome of the DOC investigation, the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce, or actions to be taken by the President, and therefore the outcome of this process and its effects on the U.S. uranium market is uncertain.\n2018 Developments\nLost Creek Property - Great Divide Basin, Wyoming\nIn August 2013, the Company was given operational approval by the NRC and commenced production operation activities. Through December 31, 2018, 2,675,652 pounds of U3O8 have been captured at Lost Creek in Mine Unit 1 ( MU1\u201d) and the first three headers houses ( HHs\u201d) in Mine Unit 2 ( MU2\u201d).\nAll of the original planned wells and 13 HHs in MU1 as well as three HHs and the related wells in MU2 have been completed and were available for operation at year end 2018. The first of the three HHs in MU2 began operations in August 2017; in January 2018, the second HH in MU2 came online; the third of the three MU2 HH started in 2017 came online in May 2018. Additional work in MU2 had been completed earlier, allowing for submittal of the appropriate operating permits. The main trunkline which has been installed services the first five MU2 HHs, and the entirety of MU2 has been fenced. All of these activities will allow for a quick turn-around to ramp up production once market fundamentals change.\nAfter more than five years of operations, Lost Creek captured 302,164 pounds captured during 2018 with a yearly average head grade of 31 ppm. The lower head grade and reduced flowrate during this period of operation is a typical result as a mine matures and older operating patterns, particularly in MU1 remain in the flow regime.\nDuring 2018, the Company sold 470,000 purchased pounds under term contracts at an average price of $49.39. From production, Lost Creek sold 10,000 pounds during 2018 in a tax-driven spot sale. The 470,000 pounds sold into term contracts were purchased at an average price of $24.42 per pound. During 2018, 302,164 pounds of U3O8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant; 286,358 pounds were packaged in drums; and 287,873 pounds of drummed inventory were shipped from the Lost Creek processing plant to the converter. At December 31, 2018, inventory at the conversion facility was approximately 375,803 pounds.\nIn August 2018 we noted a one-year milestone with no lost-time accidents at Lost Creek. Calendar year 2018 also ended free from any lost-time accidents at Lost Creek and elsewhere in the Company.\nLost Creek Regulatory Proceedings\nSubsequent to final approvals being received for operations at Lost Creek, in 2012-2013, we have made necessary additional filings for approvals of ongoing operations at Lost Creek (e.g., wellfield development; authorizations related to the new deep disposal well; permits and authority for new Class V wells). In September 2014, we filed applications for amendment of all Lost Creek permits and licenses to include recovery from the KM horizon and LC East operations. In 2015, the BLM issued a notice of intent to complete an environmental impact statement for the application. The NRC has participated in this review as a cooperating agency. A permit amendment requesting approval to mine at the LC East Project and within the KM Horizon at the Lost Creek Project was also submitted to the WDEQ. Approval will include an aquifer exemption. In early 2018 we withdrew the application insofar as it related to two of the eleven projected mine units - those for the KM Horizon at Lost Creek. The change was not anticipated to delay the completion of the permitting process with respect to the LC East Project (nine mine units total). The BLM issued its draft environmental\nimpact statement ( DEIS\u201d) in August 2018. Following public comment on the DEIS, the BLM completed its Final Environmental Impact Statement ( FEIS\u201d) and published its notice of the FEIS on January 28, 2019. We anticipate that all permits and authorizations for the amendment will be complete in 2019.\nShirley Basin Project\nBaseline studies necessary for the permitting and licensing of the project were completed in 2014. Subsequently, in December 2015, our application for a permit to mine was submitted to the WDEQ. While the Shirley Basin PEA contemplates that the Lost Creek processing facility may be utilized for the drying and packaging of uranium from Shirley Basin, which would mean we would only anticipate the need for a satellite plant, the Shirley Basin permit application contemplates the construction of a full processing facility, providing greater construction and operating flexibility as may be dictated by market conditions. WDEQ continues with its technical review of our application for a permit to mine at Shirley Basin. Our application for a source material license for Shirley Basin is proceeding through its review with the State URP. We anticipate the state process to be complete, with necessary permits and authorizations received, in 2019. Work is well underway on initial engineering evaluations, designs and studies. The BLM is expected to initiate its review of the Plan of Operations immediately upon completion of its review of the LC East amendments.\nExcel Gold Project\nIn January 2018, we announced the acquisition of a gold exploration project in west-central Nevada, comprising 102 federal lode mining claims (approximately 2,100 acres). The Excel Project is located within the Excelsior Mountains, in proximity to the Camp Douglas and Candelaria Mining Districts. We became aware of the mineral potential of this project area from exploration data contained within the large geologic database acquired as a part of our 2013 purchase of Pathfinder. Here, we identified an exploration program in the area of the Excel Project which encountered high-grade gold and silver assays from trenching activities. Company geologists conducted geologic literature research and field examinations, resulting in land acquisition activities beginning in 2017. Once a land position was obtained, rock sampling and geochemical soil sampling programs were conducted. We continue to analyze these initial assay results and conducted additional ground work at the project in 2018 and early 2019. We are currently considering alternatives to advance this exploration project.\nCorporate Organization and Financing Developments\nTrade Action\nAs described above under Industry Updates and Trends, together with Energy Fuels, we filed a trade action with the DOC in January 2018 in response to the challenges of uranium market conditions, primary among them imports to the U.S. emanating from state-sponsored producers in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.\nThe DOC announced the commencement of its investigation in July 2018 and, to date, the trade action has proceeded through various phases of the investigation. In November 2018, as a part of the investigation, Lost Creek and several other uranium mines and mills were toured by the DOC investigation team.\nAdditionally, subsequent to the end of the year, we have received a request from a Congressional committee seeking documents related to our trade action as a part of an investigation of the current administration's actions regarding uranium.\nThere can be no certainty of the outcome of the DOC investigation, the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce, or actions to be taken by the President, and therefore the outcome of this process and its effects on the U.S. uranium market is uncertain.\nChanges to Our Board of Directors\nIn January 2018, one of our founding directors, Paul Macdonell, provided notice of his retirement from our Board after more than 13 years of service. Originally projected to become effective March 1, 2018, Mr. Macdonell agreed to extend the date of his retirement, which became effective March 30, 2018. Rob Chang joined our Board, also effective March 30, 2018. Mr. Chang is a well-recognized financial expert who most recently covered the uranium mining industry for many years. We believe that his broad-ranging finance and market credentials provide strengths which add depth and experience in critical areas to our Board. Mr. Chang has 23 years of experience in the financial services industry. He is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Riot Blockchain, Inc. Prior to his current position, he most recently served as the Managing Director and Head of Metals & Mining at Cantor Fitzgerald where he provided research coverage in precious metals, base metals, lithium, and uranium. He is well familiar with the uranium mining industry and is considered a subject matter expert by several media outlets. Mr. Chang previously served as a Director of Research and Portfolio Manager at Middlefield Capital, a Canadian investment firm which managed $3 billion in assets. He was also on a five-person multi-strategy hedge fund team where he specialized in equity and derivative investments. Mr. Chang completed his MBA at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\nReduction in Workforce\nIn February 2018, a third reduction in workforce ( RIF\u201d) was implemented due to continuing depressed uranium market conditions. RIFs conducted in 2016 and 2017 affected twelve and eight employees, respectively. Nine additional employees were laid off in the 2018 RIF, following our Board's decision to defer any further development at Lost Creek while the uranium market remains at its current depressed levels. Because of the deferral of construction and development, the focus of the layoffs in 2018 was on positions in the construction and development teams, with additional positions eliminated in departments where the absence of field work will affect workload. Additionally, several employees were asked to change job responsibilities and/or team assignments. Production operations at Lost Creek proceeded uninterrupted throughout the year.\nEquity Financing\nIn September, we completed a US$10 million public offering of Common Shares. The offering of 12,195,122 Common Shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 6,097,561 Common Shares, at a combined public offering price of $0.82 per common share and accompanying warrant, closed on September 25, 2018. Ur-Energy also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,829,268 additional common shares and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 914,634 Common Shares on the same terms. The underwriters exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional securities at closing, acquiring 867,756 additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 433,878 Common Shares. Including the partial exercise of the option, Ur-Energy issued a total of 12,195,122 Common Shares and 13,062,878 warrants to purchase up to 6,531,439 Common Shares. Net proceeds from the offering was approximately $9.2 million. We anticipate that proceeds from the offering will be used to maintain and enhance operational readiness; additionally, proceeds may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOff Take Sales Agreements\nWe continue to have multiple off-take sales agreements with various U.S. utilities. These agreements were completed between 2013 and 2015, and provide for deliveries between 2019 and 2021 as follows:\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSUMMARY OF OFF TAKE SALES AGREEMENTS\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nProduction Year\n</td> <td>\nTotal Pounds Uranium Concentrates Contractually Committed\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n500,000 pounds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n390,000 pounds\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n25,000 pounds\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Results of Operations\nU3O8 Production Costs\nDuring 2018, 302,164 pounds of U3O8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant. A total of 286,358 pounds were packaged in drums and 287,873 pounds of the drummed inventory were shipped to the conversion facility where 10,000 produced pounds were sold on the spot market. The cash cost per pound and non-cash cost per pound for produced uranium presented in the following Production and Production Costs and Sales and Cost of Sales tables are non-US GAAP measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning within US GAAP or a defined basis of calculation. These measures are used by management to assess business performance and determine production and pricing strategies. They may also be used by certain investors to evaluate performance. We have restated the cost of uranium sales in 2017 and the related costs per pound to exclude the lower of cost or net realizable value ( NRV\u201d) adjustments made during that year to provide better\ncomparisons to the current year. There were no changes to the financial statements for 2017. Please see the tables below for reconciliations of these measures to the US GAAP compliant financial measures.\nProduction and sales figures for the Lost Creek Project are as follows:\nTable 46:

The respective cash costs per pound increased overall during the year primarily driven by decreasing levels of production. The more significant increase in cash and non-cash costs per pound in Q4 was driven by lower quarterly production, which is a typical result as a mine matures and older operating patterns, particularly in MU1, remain in the flow regime.\nAd valorem and severance taxes fluctuate based on pounds extracted and the related sales value of those pounds. The $1.40 average cost per pound in 2018 was lower than the previous year's $2.81 per pound due to the tax driven 10,000 pound spot sale from production.\nWellfield cash costs in 2018 Q1 were somewhat elevated due to some non-recurring expenses and the annual labor bonus in Q1. The average cash cost per pound captured increased to $9.50 in 2018 Q4 and averaged $6.84 for the year, as compared to $10.99 in 2017. The annual decrease was due to higher production levels during the year and a reduction in labor costs as we moved to maintenance-focused operations. As previously discussed, production levels were deliberately maintained at levels sufficient to satisfy our expected contract sales in light of the depressed uranium market. Wellfield non-cash costs were relatively fixed but lower than 2017 as a portion of the capitalized costs became fully depreciated in 2017. The resulting non-cash cost per pound captured was $8.28 in Q4 and averaged $5.31 for the year, as compared to $10.78 in 2017. The decrease for the year was significantly impacted by production levels which were higher than 2017.\nPlant cash costs generally decreased during the year as compared to 2017. The resulting cash cost per pound drummed increased to $21.51 in 2018 Q4 as a result of lower production but averaged $16.48 for the year, as compared to $20.02 in 2017 due to higher annual production and lower total cash costs. Plant non-cash costs did not change during the year. The non-cash cost per pound drummed increased to $9.02 in 2018 Q4 and averaged $6.82 for the year, as compared to $7.75 in 2017. The changes were directly tied to production rates.\nDistribution costs during the year decreased as compared to 2017. The resulting cash cost per pound shipped in 2018 Q4 increased to $0.70 but averaged $0.47 per pound for the year, as compared to $0.56 in 2017. Distribution costs are tied to volume but may be impacted by the timing of receiving empty barrels and assays from the Converter.\nU3O8 Sales and Cost of Sales\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

Total uranium sales were $23.5 million at an average price per pound of $48.86. The 10,000 pounds sold at the spot rate were the only sales from produced inventory for the year.\nFor the year, our uranium cost of sales totaled $11.9 million and was comprised of $11.5 million of purchase costs and $0.4 million of production costs. In 2018, we purchased 470,000 pounds at an average price of $24.42 per pound, which were all sold into our term contracts. In 2018, we sold 10,000 pounds from production. The average cost per pound sold from production was $40.80, as compared to $41.08 in 2017.\nThe gross profit from uranium sales for 2018 was $11.6 million, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 49%.

Based on existing spot prices, we were able to purchase uranium at prices that were less than our cost of production. We therefore felt that rather than reducing our resources, it was prudent to purchase pounds to complement our current production, which was based on existing wellfield assets in MU1 as well as the limited number of new HHs in MU2. The above analysis shows that we reduced our costs reflecting the reduced production levels and other cost saving measures, but not at the same rate we decreased sales from production. This is consistent with what we have previously reported, in that most of our costs are fixed so that when our production increases, our cost per pound declines and where production is scaled back, our cost per pound will increase. Compounding this is the fact that as our cost per pound increases, the carrying cost of our inventories may be subject to lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments which are reflected in our cost of goods sold and push the cost per pound of produced product sold higher. As we allocate these adjustments to taxes, cash costs and non-cash costs, all cost types show increases. Probably the most profound is in non-cash costs as all of our depletion and amortization expenses are calculated on a straight-line basis per SEC guidelines so if production is decreased by half, the related cost per pound will double. As many of our costs are fixed costs, we are not able to reduce their impact on the overall cost per pound of our products.\nAs discussed, we are continuously surveying the market for opportunities to create future, long-term, contracts at favorable rates. However, long-term pricing remained weak in 2018 and we did not enter into any new contracts. As previously shown, the Company maintains a good book of contracts into 2021. The average contract price in 2018 was close to $50 per pound for the 470,000 pounds we sold under term contracts.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP sales and inventory presentation with US GAAP statement presentation\nAs discussed above, the cash costs, non-cash costs and per pound calculations are non-US GAAP measures we use to assess business performance.

The fluctuation in sales prices relates primarily to a lower-priced spot sale made in 2018.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $43 thousand from disposal fees compared to $80 thousand during 2017.\nCost of Sales\nThe cost of sales includes all costs of wellfield operations and maintenance, severance and ad valorem taxes, plant operations and maintenance and mine site overhead including depreciation on the related capital assets, capitalized reclamation costs and amortization of mineral property costs, the cost of inventory purchased for resale and distribution costs. Wellfield costs, plant costs, site overhead costs and distribution costs are included\nin inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to expense.\nAs compared to 2017, our cost per pound sold decreased $3.19 to $24.76 in 2018. The decrease for the year was driven by the purchase of 470,000 pounds at an average price of $24.42. The cost per pound of produced product was $40.80.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit was $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 48%. Gross profits of $14.0 million in 2017 represents a gross profit margin of approximately 36%. The primary reason for the increase in the gross profit margin was the purchase of most of the product sold during 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $10.0 million. Operating expenses include exploration and evaluation expense, development expense, G&A expense and mineral property write-offs. These expenses decreased by $2.6 million compared to 2017.\nExploration and evaluation expense consists of labor and the associated costs of the exploration and evaluation departments as well as land holding and exploration costs including drilling and analysis on properties which have not reached the permitting or operations stage. These expenses decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. All costs associated with the geology and geological information systems departments as well as the costs incurred on specific projects as described above are reflected in this category. A reduction in labor and related costs was the primary reason for the decline.\nDevelopment expense includes $1.1 million of costs incurred at the Lost Creek Project not directly attributable to production activities, including wellfield construction, drilling and development costs. The decrease of $2.6 million from 2017 was related to the construction of the first three header houses in MU2, including the structures, wells and related infrastructure, which was primarily done in 2017. It also includes $0.5 million of costs associated with the Shirley Basin and Lucky Mc properties which are considered development properties as they previously reached the permitting stage or operations stage.\nG&A expense relates to administration, finance, investor relations, land and legal functions and consists principally of personnel, facility and support costs. Expenses increased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was due to increased external consulting and legal expenses of $0.4 million, associated with the trade action filed in 2018 and the related costs to advance the action.\nOther Income and Expenses\nNet interest expense declined $0.4 million during 2018 compared to the prior year. The decline was due to principal payments on outstanding debt.\nIn June 2018, we monetized the present value from portions of agreements with one of our utility customers related to 165,000 pounds of U3O8 to be delivered in 2021. We received proceeds of $3.5 million when the transaction was executed.\nAs a part of the September 2018 public offering, we sold 13,062,878 warrants priced at $0.01 per warrant. Two warrants are redeemable for one Common Share of the Company's stock at a price of $1.00 per full share. As the warrants are priced in US$ and the functional currency of the Ur-Energy Inc. is C$, this created a derivative financial liability. The liability created and adjusted quarterly is a calculated fair value using the Black-Scholes technique described below as there is no active market for the warrants. Any income or loss is reflected in net income for the period. The revaluation as of December 31, 2018 resulted in a gain of $581 for the period ended December 31, 2018 which is reflected on the statement of operations.\nIncome per Common Share\nThe basic earnings per common share for the year 2018 was $0.03. Basic earnings per common share were $Nil for 2017. For the year ended December 30, 2018, there were a net of 578,118 options and 985,496 restricted share units (RSUs) included in the diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury method. The result was diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for the year 2018. For the year ended December 30, 2017, there were a net of 539,620 options and 1,175,952 RSUs included in the diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury method. The result was diluted earnings per share of $Nil for the year 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands of U.S. dollars):\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n38,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27,305\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n(24,401)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(15,848)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n13,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11,457\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExploration and evaluation expense\n</td> <td>\n(2,623)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,964)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment expense\n</td> <td>\n(4,340)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,886)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n(5,090)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,740)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAccretion expense\n</td> <td>\n(527)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(534)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite-off of mineral properties\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(62)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income from operations\n</td> <td>\n1,387\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest income (Expense) (net)\n</td> <td>\n(1,377)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,977)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWarrant mark to market gain\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss from equity investment\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWrite-off of equity investments\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,089)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n(50)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(278)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,027)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome tax expense\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,010)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) per share - basic\n</td> <td>\n0.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.02)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) per share - diluted\n</td> <td>\n0.00 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(0.02)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue per pound sold\n</td> <td>\n49.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n39.49\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cost per pound sold\n</td> <td>\n27.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28.20\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit per pound sold\n</td> <td>\n21.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n11.29\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales\nWe sold a total of 780,000 pounds of U3O8 during the year ended December 31, 2017 for an average price of $49.09 per pound as compared to 2016 when we sold 562,000 pounds for an average price of $39.49. The fluctuation in sales prices relates primarily to lower priced spot sales made in 2016 as well as the fulfillment of some lower-priced, shorter-term contracts in 2016. In 2016, we assigned two contract deliveries totaling 200,000 pounds of U3O8 to a third-party trader. The deliveries were made during 2016 and we recognized $5.1 million in sales from those contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $80 thousand from disposal fees compared to $29 thousand during 2016.\nCost of Sales\nThe cost of sales includes all costs of wellfield operations and maintenance, severance and ad valorem taxes, plant operations and maintenance and mine site overhead including depreciation on the related capital assets, capitalized reclamation costs and amortization of mineral property costs, the cost of inventory purchased for resale and distribution costs. Wellfield costs, plant costs, site overhead costs and distribution costs are included in inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to expense.\nAs compared to 2016, our cost per pound sold decreased $0.25 to $27.95 in 2017. The decrease for the year was due to the purchase of 519,000 pounds at an average price of $21.35. The cost per pound sold of produced product was $41.08.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit from was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 36%. Gross profits of $6.3 million in 2016 represents a gross profit margin of approximately 29%. The primary reason for the increase in the gross profit margin was the higher average sales price per pound in 2017.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $12.6 million. Operating expenses include exploration and evaluation expense, development expense, G&A expense and mineral property write-offs. These expenses increased by $1.4 million compared to 2016.\nExploration and evaluation expense consists of labor and the associated costs of the exploration and evaluation departments as well as land holding and exploration costs including drilling and analysis on properties which have not reached the permitting or operations stage.

All costs associated with the geology and geological information systems departments as well as the costs incurred on specific projects as described above are reflected in this category. A reduction in labor and related costs was the primary reason for the decline.\nDevelopment expense includes $3.9 million of costs incurred at the Lost Creek Project not directly attributable to production activities, including wellfield construction, drilling and development costs. This is an increase of $1.9 million from 2016 and was related to the construction of the first three header houses in MU2 including the structures, wells and infrastructure. It also includes $0.4 million of costs associated with the Shirley Basin and Lucky Mc properties which are considered development properties as they previously reached the permitting stage or operations stage.\nG&A expense relates to administration, finance, investor relations, land and legal functions and consists principally of personnel, facility and support costs. Expenses increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was due to increased external consulting and legal expenses of $0.4 million, a substantial portion of which relates to the trade action filed in early January 2018.\nOther Income and Expenses\nNet interest expense declined $0.6 million during 2017 compared to the prior year. The decline was due to principal payments on outstanding debt.\nIn April 2017, the Management Committee of the Bootheel Project determined to continue the ownership and maintenance on the Bootheel property for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, which is the fiscal year end of The Bootheel Project, LLC. No additional exploration or development activities are expected at this time for 2018. Due to the continuing decline in the spot price of uranium combined with the reduction in minerals when a related lease was not renegotiated, the Company examined the valuation of the investment and determined that as a standalone investment, it had an insignificant value and was therefore fully impaired during 2016 resulting in a loss on investment of $1.1 million.\nIncome tax recovery\nIncome tax refunds in 2016 relates to the refund of alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years.\nIncome (Loss) per Common Share\nThe basic earnings per common share for the year 2017 was $Nil. Basic and diluted loss per common share was $0.02 for 2016. The diluted loss per common share for the year 2016 was equal to the basic loss per common share due to the anti-dilutive effect of all convertible securities outstanding given that net losses were experienced. For the year ended December 30, 2017, there were a net of 539,620 options using the treasury method and 1,175,952 RSUs included in the diluted earnings per share calculations. The result was diluted earnings per share of $Nil for the year.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nAs at December 31, 2018, we had cash resources, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, of $6.4 million, an increase of $2.5 million from the December 31, 2017 balance of $3.9 million. The cash resources consist of Canadian and U.S. dollar denominated deposit accounts and money market funds. We used $5.4 million for operations during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the same period, we generated $3.4 million from investing activities and $4.4 million from financing activities.\nOn October 23, 2013, we closed a $34.0 million Sweetwater County, State of Wyoming, Taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bond financing program ( State Bond Loan\u201d). The State Bond Loan calls for payments of interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% per annum on a quarterly basis which commenced January 1, 2014. The principal is payable in 28 quarterly installments which commenced January 1, 2015 and continue through October 1, 2021. The State Bond Loan is secured by all the assets at the Lost Creek Project. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of the State Bond Loan was $15.0 million.\nDuring 2017, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in order that we may offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, at prices and terms to be determined, up to $100 million of our Common Shares, warrants to purchase our Common Shares, our senior and subordinated debt securities, and rights to purchase our Common Shares and/or our senior and subordinated debt securities. The registration statement became effective August 3, 2017 for a three-year period.\nWe entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement ( At Market Agreement\u201d) with MLV & Co. LLC and B Riley FBR, Inc. (May 27, 2016, as amended August 2017), under which we may, from time to time, issue\nand sell Common Shares at market prices on the NYSE American or other U.S. market through the distribution agents for aggregate sales proceeds of up to $10,000,000. During 2017, we sold 1,536,169 Common Shares under the At Market Agreement at an average price of $0.76 per share for gross proceeds of $1.2 million. After deducting transaction fees and commissions and all other costs, we received net proceeds of $1.1 million. There were no shares sold under this agreement in 2018.\nIn September, we completed a US$10 million public offering of Common Shares. The offering of 12,195,122 Common Shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 6,097,561 Common Shares, at a combined public offering price of $0.82 per common share and accompanying warrant, closed on September 25, 2018. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,829,268 additional common shares and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 914,634 Common Shares on the same terms. The underwriters exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional securities at closing, acquiring 867,756 additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 433,878 Common Shares. Including the partial exercise of the option, The Company issued a total of 12,195,122 Common Shares and 13,062,878 warrants to purchase up to 6,531,439 Common Shares. Because the warrants are priced in US$ and the functional currency of Ur-Energy Inc. is C$, this created a derivative financial liability. The liability created, and adjusted quarterly, is a calculated fair value using the Black-Scholes technique described below as there is no active market for the warrants. Any income or loss from the quarterly adjustment is reflected in net income for the period. We anticipate that the public offering proceeds will be used to maintain and enhance operational readiness; additionally, proceeds may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nCollections for the year from U3O8 sales totaled $23.5 million.\nOperating activities used $5.4 million of cash resources during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to generating $5.5 million in 2017. The net income for the 2018 was $4.4 million more than the corresponding income in 2017 but included a $3.5 million gain from the monetization of 2021 term contracts, which was not considered an operating activity. In addition, $9.8 million was used to increase inventory balances, primarily at the conversion facility.\nInvesting activities included receiving $3.5 million from the monetization of 2021 term contracts. The Lost Creek Project does not require significant capital expenditures and its sustaining capital expenditures have generally been less than $0.3 million per year.\nDuring 2018, the Company raised net proceeds of $9.1 million from the sale of common shares and warrants. We used $4.9 million for principal payments on the State Bond Loan.\nLiquidity Outlook\nAs at February 27, 2019, our unrestricted cash position was $6.4 million. We expect that any major capital projects will be funded by operating cash flow, cash on hand and additional financing as required. If these cash sources are not sufficient, certain capital projects could be delayed, or alternatively we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financing and there is no assurance that such financing will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us. We have no immediate plans to issue additional securities or obtain additional funding other than that which may be required due to the uneven nature of cash flows generated from operations; however, we may issue additional debt or equity securities at any time.\nOutlook for 2019\nAlthough the average spot price per pound of U3O8, as reported by UxC, LLC and TradeTech, LLC, increased approximately 17% from $23.75 in December 2017 to about $27.75 per pound in December 2018, market fundamentals have not changed sufficiently to warrant further development of MU2.\nIn response to this persistently weak uranium market, we took aggressive measures in 2017 and 2018, and will again do so in 2019. In 2017, we deliberately slowed development activities at MU2, reduced costs, focused on enhancing production efficiencies from our operating MU1 HHs and complemented our production with cost effective purchases of uranium. In 2018, we implemented further cost reductions, purchased 100% of the uranium necessary to meet our 2018 contractual commitments, and increased our ending inventory position from 130 thousand pounds to 392 thousand pounds. For 2019, we have suspended further MU2 development activities, implemented further cost reductions, and secured purchase contracts for 100% of our 2019 delivery obligations.\nWe expect to sell 500,000 pounds under term contracts at an average price of approximately $49 per pound in 2019. We have corresponding purchase contracts in place for all 500,000 pounds at an average cost of approximately $26 per pound. We expect our gross profit in 2019 to be approximately $11.5 million from the sale of purchased product, which represents a cash-basis gross profit margin of between 45% and 50%. We are not currently forecasting any spot sales in 2019 at this time; we may, however, choose to sell additional produced product depending on market conditions.\nWe currently have over 375,000 pounds of finished, ready-to-sell, product inventory in storage at the conversion facility. The value of the product at today's $27.85 average spot price is approximately $10.4 million. Production from our operating MU1 and MU2 HHs, expected to be between 75,000 and 100,000 pounds, will be used to further build our inventory position of finished, ready-to-sell, product at the conversion facility. We intend to hold this inventory to satisfy our remaining contractual sales obligations of 415,000 pounds at an average sales price of $47 per pound, the majority of which are scheduled to be sold in 2020. The inventoried pounds, or the in-the-money contracts themselves, can readily be converted to cash on an as-needed basis.\nOperating costs in 2019 are expected to be lower than 2018 because of the suspended MU2 development activities. Other costs including capital expenditures and loan repayments will be similar to 2018.\nAs at February 27, 2019, our unrestricted cash position was $6.4 million. Given our current cash resources, inventory position, contracted sales positions, and expected margins, we do not anticipate the need for additional funding in the near term unless it is advantageous to do so.\nThe actions we have taken, together with our current cash, inventory, and sales contract positions, will give the Company the additional flexibility necessary to quickly react to changing market conditions and easily re-start development activities in MU2 when warranted. With future development and construction in mind, the staff who were retained had the greatest level of experience and adaptability allowing for an easier transition back to full operations. Lost Creek operations could increase production rates in as little as six months following a go decision simply by developing additional header houses within the fully-permitted MU2. Development expenses during this time are estimated to be approximately $14 million and are almost entirely related to MU2 drilling and header house construction costs. Lost Creek does not require any significant capital expenditures in order to increase production. The Lost Creek plant has been very well maintained and is fully ready to receive additional flows for increased production when warranted.\nAs discussed above, the Company has contractual sales commitments of 500,000 pounds during 2019, at an average price of approximately $49 per pound. We have established the delivery schedule for those commitments and determined that an effective model for dealing with the current pricing environment is to continue production from our fully operational header houses in MU1 and MU2, build inventory, and purchase uranium at favorable cost-effective prices in order to meet our sales commitments. This operating strategy for Lost Creek will allow us to control production costs, minimize development expenditures, maximize cash flows and maintain the operational flexibility to respond to market conditions.\nTable of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPayments due (by period) in thousands\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLess than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 to 5\n</td> <td>\nMore than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\nyears\n</td> <td>\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNotes payable\n</td> <td>\n$ 14,996\n</td> <td>\n$ 5,183\n</td> <td>\n$ 9,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nInterest on notes payable\n</td> <td>\n$ 1,324\n</td> <td>\n$ 752\n</td> <td>\n$ 572\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating leases\n</td> <td>\n$ 95\n</td> <td>\n$ 95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nEnvironmental remediation\n</td> <td>\n$ 77\n</td> <td>\n$ 77\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAsset retirement obligations\n</td> <td>\n$ 30,384\n</td> <td>\n$ -\n</td> <td>\n$ 3,558\n</td> <td>\n$ 3,558\n</td> <td>\n$ 23,268\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ 46,876\n</td> <td>\n$ 6,107\n</td> <td>\n$ 13,943\n</td> <td>\n$ 3,558\n</td> <td>\n$ 23,268\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOutstanding Share Data\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's capital consisted of the following:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\nChange\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCommon shares\n</td> <td>\n159,729,403\n</td> <td>\n146,531,933\n</td> <td>\n13,197,470\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWarrants (1)\n</td> <td>\n6,531,439\n</td> <td>\n5,844,567\n</td> <td>\n686,872\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRSUs\n</td> <td>\n985,496\n</td> <td>\n1,175,952\n</td> <td>\n(190,456)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock options\n</td> <td>\n9,731,612\n</td> <td>\n9,459,401\n</td> <td>\n272,211\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFully diluted shares outstanding\n</td> <td>\n176,977,950\n</td> <td>\n163,011,853\n</td> <td>\n13,966,097\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNote:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n1.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThe number of warrants reflects the actual number of shares if all 13,062,878 warrants are exercised.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements such as guaranteed contracts, contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, derivative instrument obligations, or with respect to any obligations under a variable interest entity arrangement.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents are composed of:\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nAs at\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\nDecember 31, 2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ (thousands)\n</td> <td>\n$ (thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash on deposit at banks\n</td> <td>\n1,936\n</td> <td>\n1,667\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMoney market funds\n</td> <td>\n4,436\n</td> <td>\n2,212\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n6,372\n</td> <td>\n3,879\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nQuarterly financial data (unaudited) (in thousands except for per share data)\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nQuarter ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDec. 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSep. 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nJun. 30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMar. 31\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue\n</td> <td>\n$ 14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ 3,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ 19,672\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income (loss) for the period\n</td> <td>\n$ (1,666)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ (2,809)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ 2,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$ 6,418\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome (loss) per share -

These assets include Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar denominated certificates of deposit, money market accounts and demand deposits. These instruments are maintained at financial institutions in Canada and the United States. Of the amount held on deposit, approximately $0.7 million is covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation or the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which leaves approximately $13.1 million at risk at December 31, 2018 should the financial institutions with which these amounts are invested be rendered insolvent. We do not consider any of our financial assets to be impaired as of December 31, 2018.\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they come due.\nAs at December 31, 2018, the Company's financial liabilities consisted of trade accounts payable and accrued trade and payroll liabilities of $1.0 million which are due within normal trade terms of generally 30 to 60 days, a notes payable which will be payable over 0 to 3 years, and asset retirement obligations with estimated completion dates until 2033.", "item_7_truncated": "Income (Loss) per Common Share\nSubsequent to final approvals being received for operations at Lost Creek, in 2012-2013, we have made necessary additional filings for approvals of ongoing operations at Lost Creek (e.g., wellfield development; authorizations related to the new deep disposal well; permits and authority for new Class V wells). In September 2014, we filed applications for amendment of all Lost Creek permits and licenses to include recovery from the KM horizon and LC East operations. In 2015, the BLM issued a notice of intent to complete an environmental impact statement for the application. The NRC has participated in this review as a cooperating agency. A permit amendment requesting approval to mine at the LC East Project and within the KM Horizon at the Lost Creek Project was also submitted to the WDEQ. Approval will include an aquifer exemption. In early 2018 we withdrew the application insofar as it related to two of the eleven projected mine units - those for the KM Horizon at Lost Creek. The change was not anticipated to delay the completion of the permitting process with respect to the LC East Project (nine mine units total). The BLM issued its draft environmental\nPlant cash costs generally decreased during the year as compared to 2017. The resulting cash cost per pound drummed increased to $21.51 in 2018 Q4 as a result of lower production but averaged $16.48 for the year, as compared to $20.02 in 2017 due to higher annual production and lower total cash costs. Plant non-cash costs did not change during the year. The non-cash cost per pound drummed increased to $9.02 in 2018 Q4 and averaged $6.82 for the year, as compared to $7.75 in 2017.

The respective cash costs per pound increased overall during the year primarily driven by decreasing levels of production. The more significant increase in cash and non-cash costs per pound in Q4 was driven by lower quarterly production, which is a typical result as a mine matures and older operating patterns, particularly in MU1, remain in the flow regime.\nLiquidity Outlook\nSales\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYear ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSales\n</td> <td>\n23,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n38,368\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of sales\n</td> <td>\n(12,203)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24,401)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit\n</td> <td>\n11,293\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n13,967\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nExploration and evaluation expense\n</td> <td>\n(2,431)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(2,623)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment expense\n</td> <td>\n(1,654)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(4,340)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGeneral and administrative expense\n</td> <td>\n(5,393)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5,090)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAccretion expense\n</td> <td>\n(508)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(527)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet profit from operations\n</td> <td>\n1,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,387\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet interest expense\n</td> <td>\n(1,002)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,377)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nWarrant mark to market gain\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLoss from equity investment\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(5)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nForeign exchange gain (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(50)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther income\n</td> <td>\n3,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet income\n</td> <td>\n4,534\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome per share - basic\n</td> <td>\n0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nIncome per share - diluted\n</td> <td>\n0.03\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevenue per pound sold\n</td> <td>\n48.86\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n49.09\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal cost per pound sold\n</td> <td>\n24.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n27.95\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nGross profit per pound sold\n</td> <td>\n24.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n21.14\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn July 18, 2018, DOC announced it initiated an investigation into whether the present quantity and circumstances of uranium ore and product imports into the United States threaten to impair national security.\u201d Thereafter, the DOC announced a public comment period which subsequently closed on September 25, 2018.

Two warrants are redeemable for one Common Share of the Company's stock at a price of $1.00 per full share. As the warrants are priced in US$ and the functional currency of the Ur-Energy Inc. is C$, this created a derivative financial liability. The liability created and adjusted quarterly is a calculated fair value using the Black-Scholes technique described below as there is no active market for the warrants. Any income or loss is reflected in net income for the period.

The Petition seeks a remedy which will set a quota to limit imports of uranium into the U.S. by reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. Additionally, the Petition suggests implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the Administration's Buy American Policy.\nAt the end of the year, we had approximately 375,803 pounds of U3O8 at the conversion facility at an average cost per pound of $37.75.

In 2018, several uranium miners, including Lost Creek ISR, LLC, implemented decisions to halt planned construction and development as well as to operate at lower rates of production. Cameco's November 2017 announcement to suspend production at McArthur River, the world's largest uranium mine, for at least ten months in 2018, was emblematic of the conditions of the global market. Subsequently, in July 2018, Cameco confirmed that it would extend the planned 10-month production suspension of this operation for an indeterminate duration. Numerous other mines worldwide have announced cuts in production and/or plans to shut down production operations in the near term.\nDuring 2017, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in order that we may offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, at prices and terms to be determined, up to $100 million of our Common Shares, warrants to purchase our Common Shares, our senior and subordinated debt securities, and rights to purchase our Common Shares and/or our senior and subordinated debt securities. The registration statement became effective August 3, 2017 for a three-year period.\nDuring 2018, 302,164 pounds of U3O8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant. A total of 286,358 pounds were packaged in drums and 287,873 pounds of the drummed inventory were shipped to the conversion facility where 10,000 produced pounds were sold on the spot market. The cash cost per pound and non-cash cost per pound for produced uranium presented in the following Production and Production Costs and Sales and Cost of Sales tables are non-US GAAP measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning within US GAAP or a defined basis of calculation. These measures are used by management to assess business performance and determine production and pricing strategies. They may also be used by certain investors to evaluate performance. We have restated the cost of uranium sales in 2017 and the related costs per pound to exclude the lower of cost or net realizable value ( NRV\u201d) adjustments made during that year to provide better\nSales\nOperating Expenses\nIn January 2018, we announced the acquisition of a gold exploration project in west-central Nevada, comprising 102 federal lode mining claims (approximately 2,100 acres). The Excel Project is located within the Excelsior Mountains, in proximity to the Camp Douglas and Candelaria Mining Districts. We became aware of the mineral potential of this project area from exploration data contained within the large geologic database acquired as a part of our 2013 purchase of Pathfinder. Here, we identified an exploration program in the area of the Excel Project which encountered high-grade gold and silver assays from trenching activities. Company geologists conducted geologic literature research and field examinations, resulting in land acquisition activities beginning in 2017. Once a land position was obtained, rock sampling and geochemical soil sampling programs were conducted. We continue to analyze these initial assay results and conducted additional ground work at the project in 2018 and early 2019. We are currently considering alternatives to advance this exploration project.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands of U.S. dollars):\nWe expect to sell 500,000 pounds under term contracts at an average price of approximately $49 per pound in 2019. We have corresponding purchase contracts in place for all 500,000 pounds at an average cost of approximately $26 per pound. We expect our gross profit in 2019 to be approximately $11.5 million from the sale of purchased product, which represents a cash-basis gross profit margin of between 45% and 50%. We are not currently forecasting any spot sales in 2019 at this time; we may, however, choose to sell additional produced product depending on market conditions.\nIn September, we completed a US$10 million public offering of Common Shares. The offering of 12,195,122 Common Shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 6,097,561 Common Shares, at a combined public offering price of $0.82 per common share and accompanying warrant, closed on September 25, 2018. Ur-Energy also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,829,268 additional common shares and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 914,634 Common Shares on the same terms. The underwriters exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional securities at closing, acquiring 867,756 additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 433,878 Common Shares. Including the partial exercise of the option, Ur-Energy issued a total of 12,195,122 Common Shares and 13,062,878 warrants to purchase up to 6,531,439 Common Shares. Net proceeds from the offering was approximately $9.2 million. We anticipate that proceeds from the offering will be used to maintain and enhance operational readiness; additionally, proceeds may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, deposits and restricted cash, which together totaled approximately $13.8 million at December 31, 2018. These assets include Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar denominated certificates of deposit, money market accounts and demand deposits. These instruments are maintained at financial institutions in Canada and the United States. Of the amount held on deposit, approximately $0.7 million is covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation or the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which leaves approximately $13.1 million at risk at December 31, 2018 should the financial institutions with which these amounts are invested be rendered insolvent. We do not consider any of our financial assets to be impaired as of December 31, 2018.\nFor the year, our uranium cost of sales totaled $11.9 million and was comprised of $11.5 million of purchase costs and $0.4 million of production costs. In 2018, we purchased 470,000 pounds at an average price of $24.42 per pound, which were all sold into our term contracts. In 2018, we sold 10,000 pounds from production. The average cost per pound sold from production was $40.80, as compared to $41.08 in 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\nExcel Gold Project\nGenerally, the cost per pound in ending inventory at the conversion facility decreased during the year as compared to the ending cost per pound in 2017. The decrease was directly related to the higher production figures and lower production costs in 2018 in combination with the lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments recorded during the year.\nLiquidity risk\nOutlook for 2019\nAlthough the average spot price per pound of U3O8, as reported by UxC, LLC and TradeTech, LLC, increased approximately 17% from $23.75 in December 2017 to about $27.75 per pound in December 2018, market fundamentals have not changed sufficiently to warrant further development of MU2.\nLost Creek Property - Great Divide Basin, Wyoming\nWe sold a total of 480,000 pounds of U3O8 during the year ended December 31, 2018 for an average price of $48.86 per pound as compared to 2017 when we sold 780,000 pounds for an average price of $49.09. The fluctuation in sales prices relates primarily to a lower-priced spot sale made in 2018.\nCredit risk\nTable of Contractual Obligations\nThe Company delivers U3O8 to a conversion facility and receives credit for a specified quantity measured in pounds once the product is confirmed to meet the required specifications. When a delivery is approved, the\nIn response to the challenges of the market conditions, primary among them foreign imports into the U.S. emanating from state-sponsored producers in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, on January 16, 2018, Ur-Energy USA and Energy Fuels Resources (USA) Inc. (Energy Fuels) initiated a trade action with the U.S. Department of Commerce pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. We chose this statutory framework for relief because we recognized that the current imbalance in the U.S. uranium market has created a very real threat to our national security.\n\nNet interest expense declined $0.6 million during 2017 compared to the prior year. The decline was due to principal payments on outstanding debt.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nAs discussed above, the cash costs, non-cash costs and per pound calculations are non-US GAAP measures we use to assess business performance. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the tables below present a reconciliation of these measures to the financial results as presented in our financial statements.\nU3O8 Production Costs\n\nThe gross profit was $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 48%. Gross profits of $14.0 million in 2017 represents a gross profit margin of approximately 36%. The primary reason for the increase in the gross profit margin was the purchase of most of the product sold during 2018.\nIn February 2018, a third reduction in workforce ( RIF\u201d) was implemented due to continuing depressed uranium market conditions. RIFs conducted in 2016 and 2017 affected twelve and eight employees, respectively. Nine additional employees were laid off in the 2018 RIF, following our Board's decision to defer any further development at Lost Creek while the uranium market remains at its current depressed levels. Because of the deferral of construction and development, the focus of the layoffs in 2018 was on positions in the construction and development teams, with additional positions eliminated in departments where the absence of field work will affect workload. Additionally, several employees were asked to change job responsibilities and/or team assignments. Production operations at Lost Creek proceeded uninterrupted throughout the year.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit from uranium sales for 2018 was $11.6 million, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 49%. This compares to a gross margin of $16.5 million or 43% in 2017.\nEquity Financing\nThere can be no certainty of the outcome of the DOC investigation, the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce, or actions to be taken by the President, and therefore the outcome of this process and its effects on the U.S. uranium market is uncertain.\nAs described above under Industry Updates and Trends, together with Energy Fuels, we filed a trade action with the DOC in January 2018 in response to the challenges of uranium market conditions, primary among them imports to the U.S. emanating from state-sponsored producers in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.\nCorporate Organization and Financing Developments\nBusiness Overview\nOutstanding Share Data\nNote:\nBaseline studies necessary for the permitting and licensing of the project were completed in 2014. Subsequently, in December 2015, our application for a permit to mine was submitted to the WDEQ. While the Shirley Basin PEA contemplates that the Lost Creek processing facility may be utilized for the drying and packaging of uranium from Shirley Basin, which would mean we would only anticipate the need for a satellite plant, the Shirley Basin permit application contemplates the construction of a full processing facility, providing greater construction and operating flexibility as may be dictated by market conditions. WDEQ continues with its technical review of our application for a permit to mine at Shirley Basin. Our application for a source material license for Shirley Basin is proceeding through its review with the State URP. We anticipate the state process to be complete, with necessary permits and authorizations received, in 2019. Work is well underway on initial engineering evaluations, designs and studies. The BLM is expected to initiate its review of the Plan of Operations immediately upon completion of its review of the LC East amendments.\nIn August 2018 we noted a one-year milestone with no lost-time accidents at Lost Creek. Calendar year 2018 also ended free from any lost-time accidents at Lost Creek and elsewhere in the Company.\nIn June 2018, we monetized the present value from portions of agreements with one of our utility customers related to 165,000 pounds of U3O8 to be delivered in 2021. We received proceeds of $3.5 million when the transaction was executed.\nNotes:\n 1. Wellfield cash costs include all wellfield operating costs. Wellfield construction and development costs, which include wellfield drilling, header houses, pipelines, power lines, roads, fences and disposal wells, are treated as development expense and are not included in wellfield operating costs. \nNote:\nQuarterly financial data (unaudited) (in thousands except for per share data)\nThe cost of sales includes all costs of wellfield operations and maintenance, severance and ad valorem taxes, plant operations and maintenance and mine site overhead including depreciation on the related capital assets, capitalized reclamation costs and amortization of mineral property costs, the cost of inventory purchased for resale and distribution costs. Wellfield costs, plant costs, site overhead costs and distribution costs are included in inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to expense.\nG&A expense relates to administration, finance, investor relations, land and legal functions and consists principally of personnel, facility and support costs. Expenses increased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was due to increased external consulting and legal expenses of $0.4 million, associated with the trade action filed in 2018 and the related costs to advance the action.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands of U.S. dollars):\nLost Creek Regulatory Proceedings\n\nTrade Action\nIncome per Common Share\nAs at February 27, 2019, our unrestricted cash position was $6.4 million. We expect that any major capital projects will be funded by operating cash flow, cash on hand and additional financing as required. If these cash sources are not sufficient, certain capital projects could be delayed, or alternatively we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financing and there is no assurance that such financing will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us. We have no immediate plans to issue additional securities or obtain additional funding other than that which may be required due to the uneven nature of cash flows generated from operations; however, we may issue additional debt or equity securities at any time.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments\nThe basic earnings per common share for the year 2018 was $0.03. Basic earnings per common share were $Nil for 2017. For the year ended December 30, 2018, there were a net of 578,118 options and 985,496 restricted share units (RSUs) included in the diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury method. The result was diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for the year 2018. For the year ended December 30, 2017, there were a net of 539,620 options and 1,175,952 RSUs included in the diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury method. The result was diluted earnings per share of $Nil for the year 2017.\nThere can be no certainty of the outcome of the DOC investigation, the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce, or actions to be taken by the President, and therefore the outcome of this process and its effects on the U.S. uranium market is uncertain.\nAnnual Results Comparison\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's capital consisted of the following:\nWe entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement ( At Market Agreement\u201d) with MLV & Co. LLC and B Riley FBR, Inc. (May 27, 2016, as amended August 2017), under which we may, from time to time, issue\nAdditionally, subsequent to the end of the year, we have received a request from a Congressional committee seeking documents related to our trade action as a part of an investigation of the current administration's actions regarding uranium.\nOn October 23, 2013, we closed a $34.0 million Sweetwater County, State of Wyoming, Taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bond financing program ( State Bond Loan\u201d). The State Bond Loan calls for payments of interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% per annum on a quarterly basis which commenced January 1, 2014. The principal is payable in 28 quarterly installments which commenced January 1, 2015 and continue through October 1, 2021. The State Bond Loan is secured by all the assets at the Lost Creek Project. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of the State Bond Loan was $15.0 million.\nCollections for the year from U3O8 sales totaled $23.5 million.\nProduction and sales figures for the Lost Creek Project are as follows:\nExploration and evaluation expense consists of labor and the associated costs of the exploration and evaluation departments as well as land holding and exploration costs including drilling and analysis on properties which have not reached the permitting or operations stage. These expenses decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. All costs associated with the geology and geological information systems departments as well as the costs incurred on specific projects as described above are reflected in this category. A reduction in labor and related costs was the primary reason for the decline.\nnecessary, to act to adjust the imports\u201d and/or pursue other lawful, non-trade related actions necessary to address the import threat.\nG&A expense relates to administration, finance, investor relations, land and legal functions and consists principally of personnel, facility and support costs. Expenses increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was due to increased external consulting and legal expenses of $0.4 million, a substantial portion of which relates to the trade action filed in early January 2018.\n\nIn 2018, our production levels increased due to the addition of three HHs in MU2 but were declining again by year end as we reacted to a continuing weak market by not developing additional header houses. Based on existing spot prices, we were able to purchase uranium at prices that were less than our cost of production. We therefore felt that rather than reducing our resources, it was prudent to purchase pounds to complement our current production, which was based on existing wellfield assets in MU1 as well as the limited number of new HHs in MU2. The above analysis shows that we reduced our costs reflecting the reduced production levels and other cost saving measures, but not at the same rate we decreased sales from production. This is consistent with what we have previously reported, in that most of our costs are fixed so that when our production increases, our cost per pound declines and where production is scaled back, our cost per pound will increase. Compounding this is the fact that as our cost per pound increases, the carrying cost of our inventories may be subject to lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments which are reflected in our cost of goods sold and push the cost per pound of produced product sold higher. As we allocate these adjustments to taxes, cash costs and non-cash costs, all cost types show increases. Probably the most profound is in non-cash costs as all of our depletion and amortization expenses are calculated on a straight-line basis per SEC guidelines so if production is decreased by half, the related cost per pound will double. As many of our costs are fixed costs, we are not able to reduce their impact on the overall cost per pound of our products.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $12.6 million. Operating expenses include exploration and evaluation expense, development expense, G&A expense and mineral property write-offs. These expenses increased by $1.4 million compared to 2016.\ncomparisons to the current year. There were no changes to the financial statements for 2017. Please see the tables below for reconciliations of these measures to the US GAAP compliant financial measures.\nAs compared to 2016, our cost per pound sold decreased $0.25 to $27.95 in 2017. The decrease for the year was due to the purchase of 519,000 pounds at an average price of $21.35. The cost per pound sold of produced product was $41.08.\nThe cost of sales includes all costs of wellfield operations and maintenance, severance and ad valorem taxes, plant operations and maintenance and mine site overhead including depreciation on the related capital assets, capitalized reclamation costs and amortization of mineral property costs, the cost of inventory purchased for resale and distribution costs. Wellfield costs, plant costs, site overhead costs and distribution costs are included\n 1. Costs of sales include all production costs (notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the previous Production and Production Costs table) adjusted for changes in inventory values but excludes the lower of cost or NRV adjustments as the adjustments do not correspond with the timing of the sales of produced inventory. \nin inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to expense.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they come due.\n 1. The number of warrants reflects the actual number of shares if all 13,062,878 warrants are exercised. \nAs at December 31, 2018, the Company's financial liabilities consisted of trade accounts payable and accrued trade and payroll liabilities of $1.0 million which are due within normal trade terms of generally 30 to 60 days, a notes payable which will be payable over 0 to 3 years, and asset retirement obligations with estimated completion dates until 2033.\n2018 Results of Operations\nDuring 2018, the Company raised net proceeds of $9.1 million from the sale of common shares and warrants. We used $4.9 million for principal payments on the State Bond Loan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $80 thousand from disposal fees compared to $29 thousand during 2016.\n 3. Plant cash costs include all plant operating costs and site overhead costs. \nOff Take Sales Agreements\nReduction in Workforce\nCompany notifies the conversion facility with instruction for a title transfer to the customer. Revenue is recognized once a title transfer of the U3O8 is confirmed by the conversion facility.\nThe actions we have taken, together with our current cash, inventory, and sales contract positions, will give the Company the additional flexibility necessary to quickly react to changing market conditions and easily re-start development activities in MU2 when warranted. With future development and construction in mind, the staff who were retained had the greatest level of experience and adaptability allowing for an easier transition back to full operations. Lost Creek operations could increase production rates in as little as six months following a go decision simply by developing additional header houses within the fully-permitted MU2. Development expenses during this time are estimated to be approximately $14 million and are almost entirely related to MU2 drilling and header house construction costs. Lost Creek does not require any significant capital expenditures in order to increase production. The Lost Creek plant has been very well maintained and is fully ready to receive additional flows for increased production when warranted.\nIn August 2013, the Company was given operational approval by the NRC and commenced production operation activities. Through December 31, 2018, 2,675,652 pounds of U3O8 have been captured at Lost Creek in Mine Unit 1 ( MU1\u201d) and the first three headers houses ( HHs\u201d) in Mine Unit 2 ( MU2\u201d).\nNote:\nIn January 2018, one of our founding directors, Paul Macdonell, provided notice of his retirement from our Board after more than 13 years of service. Originally projected to become effective March 1, 2018, Mr. Macdonell agreed to extend the date of his retirement, which became effective March 30, 2018. Rob Chang joined our Board, also effective March 30, 2018. Mr. Chang is a well-recognized financial expert who most recently covered the uranium mining industry for many years. We believe that his broad-ranging finance and market credentials provide strengths which add depth and experience in critical areas to our Board. Mr. Chang has 23 years of experience in the financial services industry. He is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Riot Blockchain, Inc. Prior to his current position, he most recently served as the Managing Director and Head of Metals & Mining at Cantor Fitzgerald where he provided research coverage in precious metals, base metals, lithium, and uranium. He is well familiar with the uranium mining industry and is considered a subject matter expert by several media outlets. Mr. Chang previously served as a Director of Research and Portfolio Manager at Middlefield Capital, a Canadian investment firm which managed $3 billion in assets. He was also on a five-person multi-strategy hedge fund team where he specialized in equity and derivative investments. Mr. Chang completed his MBA at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\nGross Profit\nDuring 2018, the Company sold 470,000 purchased pounds under term contracts at an average price of $49.39. From production, Lost Creek sold 10,000 pounds during 2018 in a tax-driven spot sale. The 470,000 pounds sold into term contracts were purchased at an average price of $24.42 per pound. During 2018, 302,164 pounds of U3O8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant; 286,358 pounds were packaged in drums; and 287,873 pounds of drummed inventory were shipped from the Lost Creek processing plant to the converter. At December 31, 2018, inventory at the conversion facility was approximately 375,803 pounds.\nCost of Sales\nAd valorem and severance taxes fluctuate based on pounds extracted and the related sales value of those pounds. The $1.40 average cost per pound in 2018 was lower than the previous year's $2.81 per pound due to the tax driven 10,000 pound spot sale from production.\nThe basic earnings per common share for the year 2017 was $Nil. Basic and diluted loss per common share was $0.02 for 2016. The diluted loss per common share for the year 2016 was equal to the basic loss per common share due to the anti-dilutive effect of all convertible securities outstanding given that net losses were experienced. For the year ended December 30, 2017, there were a net of 539,620 options using the treasury method and 1,175,952 RSUs included in the diluted earnings per share calculations. The result was diluted earnings per share of $Nil for the year.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide information that we believe necessary for an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nThe gross profit from was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 36%. Gross profits of $6.3 million in 2016 represents a gross profit margin of approximately 29%. The primary reason for the increase in the gross profit margin was the higher average sales price per pound in 2017.\nIn September, we completed a US$10 million public offering of Common Shares. The offering of 12,195,122 Common Shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 6,097,561 Common Shares, at a combined public offering price of $0.82 per common share and accompanying warrant, closed on September 25, 2018. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,829,268 additional common shares and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 914,634 Common Shares on the same terms. The underwriters exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional securities at closing, acquiring 867,756 additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 433,878 Common Shares. Including the partial exercise of the option, The Company issued a total of 12,195,122 Common Shares and 13,062,878 warrants to purchase up to 6,531,439 Common Shares. Because the warrants are priced in US$ and the functional currency of Ur-Energy Inc. is C$, this created a derivative financial liability. The liability created, and adjusted quarterly, is a calculated fair value using the Black-Scholes technique described below as there is no active market for the warrants. Any income or loss from the quarterly adjustment is reflected in net income for the period. We anticipate that the public offering proceeds will be used to maintain and enhance operational readiness; additionally, proceeds may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOther Income and Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $10.0 million. Operating expenses include exploration and evaluation expense, development expense, G&A expense and mineral property write-offs. These expenses decreased by $2.6 million compared to 2017.\n\nOperating Expenses\nWe continue to have multiple off-take sales agreements with various U.S. utilities. These agreements were completed between 2013 and 2015, and provide for deliveries between 2019 and 2021 as follows:\n\nAs discussed above, the Company has contractual sales commitments of 500,000 pounds during 2019, at an average price of approximately $49 per pound. We have established the delivery schedule for those commitments and determined that an effective model for dealing with the current pricing environment is to continue production from our fully operational header houses in MU1 and MU2, build inventory, and purchase uranium at favorable cost-effective prices in order to meet our sales commitments. This operating strategy for Lost Creek will allow us to control production costs, minimize development expenditures, maximize cash flows and maintain the operational flexibility to respond to market conditions.\nCost of Sales\nThe following table presents an annual comparison of a portion of the above information for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nWe have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements such as guaranteed contracts, contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, derivative instrument obligations, or with respect to any obligations under a variable interest entity arrangement.\n 4. Distribution cash costs include all shipping costs and costs charged by the conversion facility for weighing, sampling, assaying and storing the pounds prior to sale. \nIncome tax recovery\nDevelopment expense includes $1.1 million of costs incurred at the Lost Creek Project not directly attributable to production activities, including wellfield construction, drilling and development costs. The decrease of $2.6 million from 2017 was related to the construction of the first three header houses in MU2, including the structures, wells and related infrastructure, which was primarily done in 2017. It also includes $0.5 million of costs associated with the Shirley Basin and Lucky Mc properties which are considered development properties as they previously reached the permitting stage or operations stage.\nAs discussed, we are continuously surveying the market for opportunities to create future, long-term, contracts at favorable rates. However, long-term pricing remained weak in 2018 and we did not enter into any new contracts. As previously shown, the Company maintains a good book of contracts into 2021. The average contract price in 2018 was close to $50 per pound for the 470,000 pounds we sold under term contracts.\n\nAs at February 27, 2019, our unrestricted cash position was $6.4 million. Given our current cash resources, inventory position, contracted sales positions, and expected margins, we do not anticipate the need for additional funding in the near term unless it is advantageous to do so.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n 2. Non-cash costs include the amortization of the investment in the mineral property acquisition costs and the depreciation of plant equipment, and the depreciation of their related asset retirement obligation costs. The expenses are calculated on a straight-line basis, so the expenses are typically constant for each quarter. The cost per pound from these costs will therefore typically vary based on production levels only. \n\n2018 Developments\nThe DOC announced the commencement of its investigation in July 2018 and, to date, the trade action has proceeded through various phases of the investigation. In November 2018, as a part of the investigation, Lost Creek and several other uranium mines and mills were toured by the DOC investigation team.\n\nAs compared to 2017, our cost per pound sold decreased $3.19 to $24.76 in 2018. The decrease for the year was driven by the purchase of 470,000 pounds at an average price of $24.42. The cost per pound of produced product was $40.80.\nDevelopment expense includes $3.9 million of costs incurred at the Lost Creek Project not directly attributable to production activities, including wellfield construction, drilling and development costs. This is an increase of $1.9 million from 2016 and was related to the construction of the first three header houses in MU2 including the structures, wells and infrastructure. It also includes $0.4 million of costs associated with the Shirley Basin and Lucky Mc properties which are considered development properties as they previously reached the permitting stage or operations stage.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents are composed of:\n 1. For comparative purposes, gross profit and gross profit per pound for the year 2016 excludes the profit recognized on the assignment of deliveries as well as the exclusion of NRV adjustments made in the years 2017 and 2018. \nChanges to Our Board of Directors\n\nShirley Basin Project\nAll of the original planned wells and 13 HHs in MU1 as well as three HHs and the related wells in MU2 have been completed and were available for operation at year end 2018. The first of the three HHs in MU2 began operations in August 2017; in January 2018, the second HH in MU2 came online; the third of the three MU2 HH started in 2017 came online in May 2018. Additional work in MU2 had been completed earlier, allowing for submittal of the appropriate operating permits. The main trunkline which has been installed services the first five MU2 HHs, and the entirety of MU2 has been fenced. All of these activities will allow for a quick turn-around to ramp up production once market fundamentals change.\nNote:\nThe cost of sales includes ad valorem and severance taxes related to the extraction of uranium, all costs of wellfield, plant and site operations including the related depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets, reclamation and mineral property costs, plus product distribution costs. These costs are also used to value inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to cost of sales.\nWellfield cash costs in 2018 Q1 were somewhat elevated due to some non-recurring expenses and the annual labor bonus in Q1. The average cash cost per pound captured increased to $9.50 in 2018 Q4 and averaged $6.84 for the year, as compared to $10.99 in 2017. The annual decrease was due to higher production levels during the year and a reduction in labor costs as we moved to maintenance-focused operations. As previously discussed, production levels were deliberately maintained at levels sufficient to satisfy our expected contract sales in light of the depressed uranium market. Wellfield non-cash costs were relatively fixed but lower than 2017 as a portion of the capitalized costs became fully depreciated in 2017. The resulting non-cash cost per pound captured was $8.28 in Q4 and averaged $5.31 for the year, as compared to $10.78 in 2017. The decrease for the year was significantly impacted by production levels which were higher than 2017.\nIn response to this persistently weak uranium market, we took aggressive measures in 2017 and 2018, and will again do so in 2019. In 2017, we deliberately slowed development activities at MU2, reduced costs, focused on enhancing production efficiencies from our operating MU1 HHs and complemented our production with cost effective purchases of uranium. In 2018, we implemented further cost reductions, purchased 100% of the uranium necessary to meet our 2018 contractual commitments, and increased our ending inventory position from 130 thousand pounds to 392 thousand pounds. For 2019, we have suspended further MU2 development activities, implemented further cost reductions, and secured purchase contracts for 100% of our 2019 delivery obligations.\nIndustry Update and Trends\nInvesting activities included receiving $3.5 million from the monetization of 2021 term contracts. The Lost Creek Project does not require significant capital expenditures and its sustaining capital expenditures have generally been less than $0.3 million per year.\nThere were no pounds sold in Q4. For the year, we sold 480,000 pounds, of which 470,000 were sold under term contracts at an average price per pound of $49.39 and 10,000 pounds were sold at a spot price of $23.75 per pound. Total uranium sales were $23.5 million at an average price per pound of $48.86. The 10,000 pounds sold at the spot rate were the only sales from produced inventory for the year.\nAfter more than five years of operations, Lost Creek captured 302,164 pounds captured during 2018 with a yearly average head grade of 31 ppm. The lower head grade and reduced flowrate during this period of operation is a typical result as a mine matures and older operating patterns, particularly in MU1 remain in the flow regime.\nIn April 2017, the Management Committee of the Bootheel Project determined to continue the ownership and maintenance on the Bootheel property for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, which is the fiscal year end of The Bootheel Project, LLC. No additional exploration or development activities are expected at this time for 2018. Due to the continuing decline in the spot price of uranium combined with the reduction in minerals when a related lease was not renegotiated, the Company examined the valuation of the investment and determined that as a standalone investment, it had an insignificant value and was therefore fully impaired during 2016 resulting in a loss on investment of $1.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $43 thousand from disposal fees compared to $80 thousand during 2017.\n\nOperating costs in 2019 are expected to be lower than 2018 because of the suspended MU2 development activities. Other costs including capital expenditures and loan repayments will be similar to 2018.\n\nAs discussed elsewhere in this report, we completed the development of the third header house in Lost Creek's second mine unit, while continuing to control annual production rates at a modest target of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds. Production at Lost Creek in 2018 totaled 302,164 pounds captured in the plant. While U.S. miners lowered production rates and halted development ensuring near-term production will remain lower, imports continued to dominate the U.S. market in 2018. Projections at year end suggest that U.S. uranium miners accounted for less than two percent of domestic uranium needs.\nWe sold a total of 780,000 pounds of U3O8 during the year ended December 31, 2017 for an average price of $49.09 per pound as compared to 2016 when we sold 562,000 pounds for an average price of $39.49. The fluctuation in sales prices relates primarily to lower priced spot sales made in 2016 as well as the fulfillment of some lower-priced, shorter-term contracts in 2016. In 2016, we assigned two contract deliveries totaling 200,000 pounds of U3O8 to a third-party trader. The deliveries were made during 2016 and we recognized $5.1 million in sales from those contracts.", "item_7_text": "Income (Loss) per Common Share\nSubsequent to final approvals being received for operations at Lost Creek, in 2012-2013, we have made necessary additional filings for approvals of ongoing operations at Lost Creek (e.g., wellfield development; authorizations related to the new deep disposal well; permits and authority for new Class V wells). In September 2014, we filed applications for amendment of all Lost Creek permits and licenses to include recovery from the KM horizon and LC East operations. In 2015, the BLM issued a notice of intent to complete an environmental impact statement for the application. The NRC has participated in this review as a cooperating agency. A permit amendment requesting approval to mine at the LC East Project and within the KM Horizon at the Lost Creek Project was also submitted to the WDEQ. Approval will include an aquifer exemption. In early 2018 we withdrew the application insofar as it related to two of the eleven projected mine units - those for the KM Horizon at Lost Creek. The change was not anticipated to delay the completion of the permitting process with respect to the LC East Project (nine mine units total). The BLM issued its draft environmental\nPlant cash costs generally decreased during the year as compared to 2017. The resulting cash cost per pound drummed increased to $21.51 in 2018 Q4 as a result of lower production but averaged $16.48 for the year, as compared to $20.02 in 2017 due to higher annual production and lower total cash costs. Plant non-cash costs did not change during the year. The non-cash cost per pound drummed increased to $9.02 in 2018 Q4 and averaged $6.82 for the year, as compared to $7.75 in 2017. The changes were directly tied to production rates.\nU3O8 Sales and Cost of Sales\nOperating activities used $5.4 million of cash resources during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to generating $5.5 million in 2017. The net income for the 2018 was $4.4 million more than the corresponding income in 2017 but included a $3.5 million gain from the monetization of 2021 term contracts, which was not considered an operating activity. In addition, $9.8 million was used to increase inventory balances, primarily at the conversion facility.\nIn total, wellfield, plant and distribution cash costs were very consistent quarter on quarter during 2018. The respective cash costs per pound increased overall during the year primarily driven by decreasing levels of production. The more significant increase in cash and non-cash costs per pound in Q4 was driven by lower quarterly production, which is a typical result as a mine matures and older operating patterns, particularly in MU1, remain in the flow regime.\nLiquidity Outlook\nSales\nOn July 18, 2018, DOC announced it initiated an investigation into whether the present quantity and circumstances of uranium ore and product imports into the United States threaten to impair national security.\u201d Thereafter, the DOC announced a public comment period which subsequently closed on September 25, 2018. Other aspects of the investigation are proceeding; the DOC investigation must be complete by April 15, 2019. Thereafter, the President has 90 days (until July 15, 2019) to act on the DOC's recommendations and, if\nAs at December 31, 2018, we had cash resources, consisting of cash and cash equivalents, of $6.4 million, an increase of $2.5 million from the December 31, 2017 balance of $3.9 million. The cash resources consist of Canadian and U.S. dollar denominated deposit accounts and money market funds. We used $5.4 million for operations during the year ended December 31, 2018. During the same period, we generated $3.4 million from investing activities and $4.4 million from financing activities.\n\nAs a part of the September 2018 public offering, we sold 13,062,878 warrants priced at $0.01 per warrant. Two warrants are redeemable for one Common Share of the Company's stock at a price of $1.00 per full share. As the warrants are priced in US$ and the functional currency of the Ur-Energy Inc. is C$, this created a derivative financial liability. The liability created and adjusted quarterly is a calculated fair value using the Black-Scholes technique described below as there is no active market for the warrants. Any income or loss is reflected in net income for the period. The revaluation as of December 31, 2018 resulted in a gain of $581 for the period ended December 31, 2018 which is reflected on the statement of operations.\nThe Petition for Relief with the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (as amended) From Imports of Uranium Products that Threaten U.S. National Security ( Petition\u201d) describes how uranium and nuclear fuel from state-owned and state-subsidized enterprises in Russia, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and China represent a threat to U.S. national security. The Petition seeks a remedy which will set a quota to limit imports of uranium into the U.S. by reserving 25% of the U.S. nuclear market for U.S. uranium production. Additionally, the Petition suggests implementation of a requirement for U.S. federal utilities and agencies to buy U.S. uranium in accordance with the Administration's Buy American Policy.\nAt the end of the year, we had approximately 375,803 pounds of U3O8 at the conversion facility at an average cost per pound of $37.75. The following table shows the average cost per pound of the conversion facility inventory.\nOther Income and Expenses\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP sales and inventory presentation with US GAAP statement presentation\nDistribution costs during the year decreased as compared to 2017. The resulting cash cost per pound shipped in 2018 Q4 increased to $0.70 but averaged $0.47 per pound for the year, as compared to $0.56 in 2017. Distribution costs are tied to volume but may be impacted by the timing of receiving empty barrels and assays from the Converter.\nIncome tax refunds in 2016 relates to the refund of alternative minimum taxes paid in prior years.\nNet interest expense declined $0.4 million during 2018 compared to the prior year. The decline was due to principal payments on outstanding debt.\n 1. The cost per pound sold reflects both cash and non-cash costs, which are combined as cost of sales in the statement of operations included in this filing. The cash and non-cash cost components are identified in the above production cost table. It excludes the lower of cost or NRV adjustments as the adjustments do not correspond with the timing of the sales of produced inventory. \nWe currently have over 375,000 pounds of finished, ready-to-sell, product inventory in storage at the conversion facility. The value of the product at today's $27.85 average spot price is approximately $10.4 million. Production from our operating MU1 and MU2 HHs, expected to be between 75,000 and 100,000 pounds, will be used to further build our inventory position of finished, ready-to-sell, product at the conversion facility. We intend to hold this inventory to satisfy our remaining contractual sales obligations of 415,000 pounds at an average sales price of $47 per pound, the majority of which are scheduled to be sold in 2020. The inventoried pounds, or the in-the-money contracts themselves, can readily be converted to cash on an as-needed basis.\nimpact statement ( DEIS\u201d) in August 2018. Following public comment on the DEIS, the BLM completed its Final Environmental Impact Statement ( FEIS\u201d) and published its notice of the FEIS on January 28, 2019. We anticipate that all permits and authorizations for the amendment will be complete in 2019.\nExploration and evaluation expense consists of labor and the associated costs of the exploration and evaluation departments as well as land holding and exploration costs including drilling and analysis on properties which have not reached the permitting or operations stage. These expenses decreased $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. All costs associated with the geology and geological information systems departments as well as the costs incurred on specific projects as described above are reflected in this category. A reduction in labor and related costs was the primary reason for the decline.\nItem 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION\nand sell Common Shares at market prices on the NYSE American or other U.S. market through the distribution agents for aggregate sales proceeds of up to $10,000,000. During 2017, we sold 1,536,169 Common Shares under the At Market Agreement at an average price of $0.76 per share for gross proceeds of $1.2 million. After deducting transaction fees and commissions and all other costs, we received net proceeds of $1.1 million. There were no shares sold under this agreement in 2018.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe uranium industry continues to be characterized by persistently low pricing, and threats to pricing and market stability created by foreign state-sponsored producers. In 2018, several uranium miners, including Lost Creek ISR, LLC, implemented decisions to halt planned construction and development as well as to operate at lower rates of production. Cameco's November 2017 announcement to suspend production at McArthur River, the world's largest uranium mine, for at least ten months in 2018, was emblematic of the conditions of the global market. Subsequently, in July 2018, Cameco confirmed that it would extend the planned 10-month production suspension of this operation for an indeterminate duration. Numerous other mines worldwide have announced cuts in production and/or plans to shut down production operations in the near term.\nDuring 2017, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 with the SEC in order that we may offer and sell, from time to time, in one or more offerings, at prices and terms to be determined, up to $100 million of our Common Shares, warrants to purchase our Common Shares, our senior and subordinated debt securities, and rights to purchase our Common Shares and/or our senior and subordinated debt securities. The registration statement became effective August 3, 2017 for a three-year period.\nDuring 2018, 302,164 pounds of U3O8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant. A total of 286,358 pounds were packaged in drums and 287,873 pounds of the drummed inventory were shipped to the conversion facility where 10,000 produced pounds were sold on the spot market. The cash cost per pound and non-cash cost per pound for produced uranium presented in the following Production and Production Costs and Sales and Cost of Sales tables are non-US GAAP measures. These measures do not have a standardized meaning within US GAAP or a defined basis of calculation. These measures are used by management to assess business performance and determine production and pricing strategies. They may also be used by certain investors to evaluate performance. We have restated the cost of uranium sales in 2017 and the related costs per pound to exclude the lower of cost or net realizable value ( NRV\u201d) adjustments made during that year to provide better\nSales\nOperating Expenses\nIn January 2018, we announced the acquisition of a gold exploration project in west-central Nevada, comprising 102 federal lode mining claims (approximately 2,100 acres). The Excel Project is located within the Excelsior Mountains, in proximity to the Camp Douglas and Candelaria Mining Districts. We became aware of the mineral potential of this project area from exploration data contained within the large geologic database acquired as a part of our 2013 purchase of Pathfinder. Here, we identified an exploration program in the area of the Excel Project which encountered high-grade gold and silver assays from trenching activities. Company geologists conducted geologic literature research and field examinations, resulting in land acquisition activities beginning in 2017. Once a land position was obtained, rock sampling and geochemical soil sampling programs were conducted. We continue to analyze these initial assay results and conducted additional ground work at the project in 2018 and early 2019. We are currently considering alternatives to advance this exploration project.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands of U.S. dollars):\nWe expect to sell 500,000 pounds under term contracts at an average price of approximately $49 per pound in 2019. We have corresponding purchase contracts in place for all 500,000 pounds at an average cost of approximately $26 per pound. We expect our gross profit in 2019 to be approximately $11.5 million from the sale of purchased product, which represents a cash-basis gross profit margin of between 45% and 50%. We are not currently forecasting any spot sales in 2019 at this time; we may, however, choose to sell additional produced product depending on market conditions.\nIn September, we completed a US$10 million public offering of Common Shares. The offering of 12,195,122 Common Shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 6,097,561 Common Shares, at a combined public offering price of $0.82 per common share and accompanying warrant, closed on September 25, 2018. Ur-Energy also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,829,268 additional common shares and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 914,634 Common Shares on the same terms. The underwriters exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional securities at closing, acquiring 867,756 additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 433,878 Common Shares. Including the partial exercise of the option, Ur-Energy issued a total of 12,195,122 Common Shares and 13,062,878 warrants to purchase up to 6,531,439 Common Shares. Net proceeds from the offering was approximately $9.2 million. We anticipate that proceeds from the offering will be used to maintain and enhance operational readiness; additionally, proceeds may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents, deposits and restricted cash, which together totaled approximately $13.8 million at December 31, 2018. These assets include Canadian dollar and U.S. dollar denominated certificates of deposit, money market accounts and demand deposits. These instruments are maintained at financial institutions in Canada and the United States. Of the amount held on deposit, approximately $0.7 million is covered by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Securities Investor Protection Corporation or the United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation which leaves approximately $13.1 million at risk at December 31, 2018 should the financial institutions with which these amounts are invested be rendered insolvent. We do not consider any of our financial assets to be impaired as of December 31, 2018.\nFor the year, our uranium cost of sales totaled $11.9 million and was comprised of $11.5 million of purchase costs and $0.4 million of production costs. In 2018, we purchased 470,000 pounds at an average price of $24.42 per pound, which were all sold into our term contracts. In 2018, we sold 10,000 pounds from production. The average cost per pound sold from production was $40.80, as compared to $41.08 in 2017.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\n\nExcel Gold Project\nGenerally, the cost per pound in ending inventory at the conversion facility decreased during the year as compared to the ending cost per pound in 2017. The decrease was directly related to the higher production figures and lower production costs in 2018 in combination with the lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments recorded during the year.\nLiquidity risk\nOutlook for 2019\nAlthough the average spot price per pound of U3O8, as reported by UxC, LLC and TradeTech, LLC, increased approximately 17% from $23.75 in December 2017 to about $27.75 per pound in December 2018, market fundamentals have not changed sufficiently to warrant further development of MU2.\nLost Creek Property - Great Divide Basin, Wyoming\nWe sold a total of 480,000 pounds of U3O8 during the year ended December 31, 2018 for an average price of $48.86 per pound as compared to 2017 when we sold 780,000 pounds for an average price of $49.09. The fluctuation in sales prices relates primarily to a lower-priced spot sale made in 2018.\nCredit risk\nTable of Contractual Obligations\nThe Company delivers U3O8 to a conversion facility and receives credit for a specified quantity measured in pounds once the product is confirmed to meet the required specifications. When a delivery is approved, the\nIn response to the challenges of the market conditions, primary among them foreign imports into the U.S. emanating from state-sponsored producers in Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, on January 16, 2018, Ur-Energy USA and Energy Fuels Resources (USA) Inc. (Energy Fuels) initiated a trade action with the U.S. Department of Commerce pursuant to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act. We chose this statutory framework for relief because we recognized that the current imbalance in the U.S. uranium market has created a very real threat to our national security.\n\nNet interest expense declined $0.6 million during 2017 compared to the prior year. The decline was due to principal payments on outstanding debt.\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nAs discussed above, the cash costs, non-cash costs and per pound calculations are non-US GAAP measures we use to assess business performance. To facilitate a better understanding of these measures, the tables below present a reconciliation of these measures to the financial results as presented in our financial statements.\nU3O8 Production Costs\n\nThe gross profit was $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 48%. Gross profits of $14.0 million in 2017 represents a gross profit margin of approximately 36%. The primary reason for the increase in the gross profit margin was the purchase of most of the product sold during 2018.\nIn February 2018, a third reduction in workforce ( RIF\u201d) was implemented due to continuing depressed uranium market conditions. RIFs conducted in 2016 and 2017 affected twelve and eight employees, respectively. Nine additional employees were laid off in the 2018 RIF, following our Board's decision to defer any further development at Lost Creek while the uranium market remains at its current depressed levels. Because of the deferral of construction and development, the focus of the layoffs in 2018 was on positions in the construction and development teams, with additional positions eliminated in departments where the absence of field work will affect workload. Additionally, several employees were asked to change job responsibilities and/or team assignments. Production operations at Lost Creek proceeded uninterrupted throughout the year.\nGross Profit\nThe gross profit from uranium sales for 2018 was $11.6 million, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 49%. This compares to a gross margin of $16.5 million or 43% in 2017.\nEquity Financing\nThere can be no certainty of the outcome of the DOC investigation, the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce, or actions to be taken by the President, and therefore the outcome of this process and its effects on the U.S. uranium market is uncertain.\nAs described above under Industry Updates and Trends, together with Energy Fuels, we filed a trade action with the DOC in January 2018 in response to the challenges of uranium market conditions, primary among them imports to the U.S. emanating from state-sponsored producers in Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan.\nCorporate Organization and Financing Developments\nBusiness Overview\nOutstanding Share Data\nNote:\nBaseline studies necessary for the permitting and licensing of the project were completed in 2014. Subsequently, in December 2015, our application for a permit to mine was submitted to the WDEQ. While the Shirley Basin PEA contemplates that the Lost Creek processing facility may be utilized for the drying and packaging of uranium from Shirley Basin, which would mean we would only anticipate the need for a satellite plant, the Shirley Basin permit application contemplates the construction of a full processing facility, providing greater construction and operating flexibility as may be dictated by market conditions. WDEQ continues with its technical review of our application for a permit to mine at Shirley Basin. Our application for a source material license for Shirley Basin is proceeding through its review with the State URP. We anticipate the state process to be complete, with necessary permits and authorizations received, in 2019. Work is well underway on initial engineering evaluations, designs and studies. The BLM is expected to initiate its review of the Plan of Operations immediately upon completion of its review of the LC East amendments.\nIn August 2018 we noted a one-year milestone with no lost-time accidents at Lost Creek. Calendar year 2018 also ended free from any lost-time accidents at Lost Creek and elsewhere in the Company.\nIn June 2018, we monetized the present value from portions of agreements with one of our utility customers related to 165,000 pounds of U3O8 to be delivered in 2021. We received proceeds of $3.5 million when the transaction was executed.\nNotes:\n 1. Wellfield cash costs include all wellfield operating costs. Wellfield construction and development costs, which include wellfield drilling, header houses, pipelines, power lines, roads, fences and disposal wells, are treated as development expense and are not included in wellfield operating costs. \nNote:\nQuarterly financial data (unaudited) (in thousands except for per share data)\nThe cost of sales includes all costs of wellfield operations and maintenance, severance and ad valorem taxes, plant operations and maintenance and mine site overhead including depreciation on the related capital assets, capitalized reclamation costs and amortization of mineral property costs, the cost of inventory purchased for resale and distribution costs. Wellfield costs, plant costs, site overhead costs and distribution costs are included in inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to expense.\nG&A expense relates to administration, finance, investor relations, land and legal functions and consists principally of personnel, facility and support costs. Expenses increased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was due to increased external consulting and legal expenses of $0.4 million, associated with the trade action filed in 2018 and the related costs to advance the action.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands of U.S. dollars):\nLost Creek Regulatory Proceedings\n\nTrade Action\nIncome per Common Share\nAs at February 27, 2019, our unrestricted cash position was $6.4 million. We expect that any major capital projects will be funded by operating cash flow, cash on hand and additional financing as required. If these cash sources are not sufficient, certain capital projects could be delayed, or alternatively we may need to pursue additional debt or equity financing and there is no assurance that such financing will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us. We have no immediate plans to issue additional securities or obtain additional funding other than that which may be required due to the uneven nature of cash flows generated from operations; however, we may issue additional debt or equity securities at any time.\nFinancial Instruments and Other Instruments\nThe basic earnings per common share for the year 2018 was $0.03. Basic earnings per common share were $Nil for 2017. For the year ended December 30, 2018, there were a net of 578,118 options and 985,496 restricted share units (RSUs) included in the diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury method. The result was diluted earnings per share of $0.03 for the year 2018. For the year ended December 30, 2017, there were a net of 539,620 options and 1,175,952 RSUs included in the diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury method. The result was diluted earnings per share of $Nil for the year 2017.\nThere can be no certainty of the outcome of the DOC investigation, the recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce, or actions to be taken by the President, and therefore the outcome of this process and its effects on the U.S. uranium market is uncertain.\nAnnual Results Comparison\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company's capital consisted of the following:\nWe entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement ( At Market Agreement\u201d) with MLV & Co. LLC and B Riley FBR, Inc. (May 27, 2016, as amended August 2017), under which we may, from time to time, issue\nAdditionally, subsequent to the end of the year, we have received a request from a Congressional committee seeking documents related to our trade action as a part of an investigation of the current administration's actions regarding uranium.\nOn October 23, 2013, we closed a $34.0 million Sweetwater County, State of Wyoming, Taxable Industrial Development Revenue Bond financing program ( State Bond Loan\u201d). The State Bond Loan calls for payments of interest at a fixed rate of 5.75% per annum on a quarterly basis which commenced January 1, 2014. The principal is payable in 28 quarterly installments which commenced January 1, 2015 and continue through October 1, 2021. The State Bond Loan is secured by all the assets at the Lost Creek Project. As of December 31, 2018, the balance of the State Bond Loan was $15.0 million.\nCollections for the year from U3O8 sales totaled $23.5 million.\nProduction and sales figures for the Lost Creek Project are as follows:\nExploration and evaluation expense consists of labor and the associated costs of the exploration and evaluation departments as well as land holding and exploration costs including drilling and analysis on properties which have not reached the permitting or operations stage. These expenses decreased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. All costs associated with the geology and geological information systems departments as well as the costs incurred on specific projects as described above are reflected in this category. A reduction in labor and related costs was the primary reason for the decline.\nnecessary, to act to adjust the imports\u201d and/or pursue other lawful, non-trade related actions necessary to address the import threat.\nG&A expense relates to administration, finance, investor relations, land and legal functions and consists principally of personnel, facility and support costs. Expenses increased by $0.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was due to increased external consulting and legal expenses of $0.4 million, a substantial portion of which relates to the trade action filed in early January 2018.\n\nIn 2018, our production levels increased due to the addition of three HHs in MU2 but were declining again by year end as we reacted to a continuing weak market by not developing additional header houses. Based on existing spot prices, we were able to purchase uranium at prices that were less than our cost of production. We therefore felt that rather than reducing our resources, it was prudent to purchase pounds to complement our current production, which was based on existing wellfield assets in MU1 as well as the limited number of new HHs in MU2. The above analysis shows that we reduced our costs reflecting the reduced production levels and other cost saving measures, but not at the same rate we decreased sales from production. This is consistent with what we have previously reported, in that most of our costs are fixed so that when our production increases, our cost per pound declines and where production is scaled back, our cost per pound will increase. Compounding this is the fact that as our cost per pound increases, the carrying cost of our inventories may be subject to lower of cost or net realizable value adjustments which are reflected in our cost of goods sold and push the cost per pound of produced product sold higher. As we allocate these adjustments to taxes, cash costs and non-cash costs, all cost types show increases. Probably the most profound is in non-cash costs as all of our depletion and amortization expenses are calculated on a straight-line basis per SEC guidelines so if production is decreased by half, the related cost per pound will double. As many of our costs are fixed costs, we are not able to reduce their impact on the overall cost per pound of our products.\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $12.6 million. Operating expenses include exploration and evaluation expense, development expense, G&A expense and mineral property write-offs. These expenses increased by $1.4 million compared to 2016.\ncomparisons to the current year. There were no changes to the financial statements for 2017. Please see the tables below for reconciliations of these measures to the US GAAP compliant financial measures.\nAs compared to 2016, our cost per pound sold decreased $0.25 to $27.95 in 2017. The decrease for the year was due to the purchase of 519,000 pounds at an average price of $21.35. The cost per pound sold of produced product was $41.08.\nThe cost of sales includes all costs of wellfield operations and maintenance, severance and ad valorem taxes, plant operations and maintenance and mine site overhead including depreciation on the related capital assets, capitalized reclamation costs and amortization of mineral property costs, the cost of inventory purchased for resale and distribution costs. Wellfield costs, plant costs, site overhead costs and distribution costs are included\n 1. Costs of sales include all production costs (notes 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the previous Production and Production Costs table) adjusted for changes in inventory values but excludes the lower of cost or NRV adjustments as the adjustments do not correspond with the timing of the sales of produced inventory. \nin inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to expense.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018:\nLiquidity risk is the risk that we will not be able to meet our financial obligations as they come due.\n 1. The number of warrants reflects the actual number of shares if all 13,062,878 warrants are exercised. \nAs at December 31, 2018, the Company's financial liabilities consisted of trade accounts payable and accrued trade and payroll liabilities of $1.0 million which are due within normal trade terms of generally 30 to 60 days, a notes payable which will be payable over 0 to 3 years, and asset retirement obligations with estimated completion dates until 2033.\n2018 Results of Operations\nDuring 2018, the Company raised net proceeds of $9.1 million from the sale of common shares and warrants. We used $4.9 million for principal payments on the State Bond Loan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized $80 thousand from disposal fees compared to $29 thousand during 2016.\n 3. Plant cash costs include all plant operating costs and site overhead costs. \nOff Take Sales Agreements\nReduction in Workforce\nCompany notifies the conversion facility with instruction for a title transfer to the customer. Revenue is recognized once a title transfer of the U3O8 is confirmed by the conversion facility.\nThe actions we have taken, together with our current cash, inventory, and sales contract positions, will give the Company the additional flexibility necessary to quickly react to changing market conditions and easily re-start development activities in MU2 when warranted. With future development and construction in mind, the staff who were retained had the greatest level of experience and adaptability allowing for an easier transition back to full operations. Lost Creek operations could increase production rates in as little as six months following a go decision simply by developing additional header houses within the fully-permitted MU2. Development expenses during this time are estimated to be approximately $14 million and are almost entirely related to MU2 drilling and header house construction costs. Lost Creek does not require any significant capital expenditures in order to increase production. The Lost Creek plant has been very well maintained and is fully ready to receive additional flows for increased production when warranted.\nIn August 2013, the Company was given operational approval by the NRC and commenced production operation activities. Through December 31, 2018, 2,675,652 pounds of U3O8 have been captured at Lost Creek in Mine Unit 1 ( MU1\u201d) and the first three headers houses ( HHs\u201d) in Mine Unit 2 ( MU2\u201d).\nNote:\nIn January 2018, one of our founding directors, Paul Macdonell, provided notice of his retirement from our Board after more than 13 years of service. Originally projected to become effective March 1, 2018, Mr. Macdonell agreed to extend the date of his retirement, which became effective March 30, 2018. Rob Chang joined our Board, also effective March 30, 2018. Mr. Chang is a well-recognized financial expert who most recently covered the uranium mining industry for many years. We believe that his broad-ranging finance and market credentials provide strengths which add depth and experience in critical areas to our Board. Mr. Chang has 23 years of experience in the financial services industry. He is currently the Chief Financial Officer of Riot Blockchain, Inc. Prior to his current position, he most recently served as the Managing Director and Head of Metals & Mining at Cantor Fitzgerald where he provided research coverage in precious metals, base metals, lithium, and uranium. He is well familiar with the uranium mining industry and is considered a subject matter expert by several media outlets. Mr. Chang previously served as a Director of Research and Portfolio Manager at Middlefield Capital, a Canadian investment firm which managed $3 billion in assets. He was also on a five-person multi-strategy hedge fund team where he specialized in equity and derivative investments. Mr. Chang completed his MBA at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.\nGross Profit\nDuring 2018, the Company sold 470,000 purchased pounds under term contracts at an average price of $49.39. From production, Lost Creek sold 10,000 pounds during 2018 in a tax-driven spot sale. The 470,000 pounds sold into term contracts were purchased at an average price of $24.42 per pound. During 2018, 302,164 pounds of U3O8 were captured within the Lost Creek plant; 286,358 pounds were packaged in drums; and 287,873 pounds of drummed inventory were shipped from the Lost Creek processing plant to the converter. At December 31, 2018, inventory at the conversion facility was approximately 375,803 pounds.\nCost of Sales\nAd valorem and severance taxes fluctuate based on pounds extracted and the related sales value of those pounds. The $1.40 average cost per pound in 2018 was lower than the previous year's $2.81 per pound due to the tax driven 10,000 pound spot sale from production.\nThe basic earnings per common share for the year 2017 was $Nil. Basic and diluted loss per common share was $0.02 for 2016. The diluted loss per common share for the year 2016 was equal to the basic loss per common share due to the anti-dilutive effect of all convertible securities outstanding given that net losses were experienced. For the year ended December 30, 2017, there were a net of 539,620 options using the treasury method and 1,175,952 RSUs included in the diluted earnings per share calculations. The result was diluted earnings per share of $Nil for the year.\nThe following discussion is designed to provide information that we believe necessary for an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and related notes. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with US GAAP.\nThe gross profit from was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which represents a gross profit margin of approximately 36%. Gross profits of $6.3 million in 2016 represents a gross profit margin of approximately 29%. The primary reason for the increase in the gross profit margin was the higher average sales price per pound in 2017.\nIn September, we completed a US$10 million public offering of Common Shares. The offering of 12,195,122 Common Shares and accompanying warrants to purchase up to 6,097,561 Common Shares, at a combined public offering price of $0.82 per common share and accompanying warrant, closed on September 25, 2018. We also granted the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to 1,829,268 additional common shares and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 914,634 Common Shares on the same terms. The underwriters exercised a portion of their option to purchase additional securities at closing, acquiring 867,756 additional warrants to purchase an aggregate of 433,878 Common Shares. Including the partial exercise of the option, The Company issued a total of 12,195,122 Common Shares and 13,062,878 warrants to purchase up to 6,531,439 Common Shares. Because the warrants are priced in US$ and the functional currency of Ur-Energy Inc. is C$, this created a derivative financial liability. The liability created, and adjusted quarterly, is a calculated fair value using the Black-Scholes technique described below as there is no active market for the warrants. Any income or loss from the quarterly adjustment is reflected in net income for the period. We anticipate that the public offering proceeds will be used to maintain and enhance operational readiness; additionally, proceeds may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOther Income and Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $10.0 million. Operating expenses include exploration and evaluation expense, development expense, G&A expense and mineral property write-offs. These expenses decreased by $2.6 million compared to 2017.\n\nOperating Expenses\nWe continue to have multiple off-take sales agreements with various U.S. utilities. These agreements were completed between 2013 and 2015, and provide for deliveries between 2019 and 2021 as follows:\n\nAs discussed above, the Company has contractual sales commitments of 500,000 pounds during 2019, at an average price of approximately $49 per pound. We have established the delivery schedule for those commitments and determined that an effective model for dealing with the current pricing environment is to continue production from our fully operational header houses in MU1 and MU2, build inventory, and purchase uranium at favorable cost-effective prices in order to meet our sales commitments. This operating strategy for Lost Creek will allow us to control production costs, minimize development expenditures, maximize cash flows and maintain the operational flexibility to respond to market conditions.\nCost of Sales\nThe following table presents an annual comparison of a portion of the above information for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016:\nWe have not entered into any material off-balance sheet arrangements such as guaranteed contracts, contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities, derivative instrument obligations, or with respect to any obligations under a variable interest entity arrangement.\n 4. Distribution cash costs include all shipping costs and costs charged by the conversion facility for weighing, sampling, assaying and storing the pounds prior to sale. \nIncome tax recovery\nDevelopment expense includes $1.1 million of costs incurred at the Lost Creek Project not directly attributable to production activities, including wellfield construction, drilling and development costs. The decrease of $2.6 million from 2017 was related to the construction of the first three header houses in MU2, including the structures, wells and related infrastructure, which was primarily done in 2017. It also includes $0.5 million of costs associated with the Shirley Basin and Lucky Mc properties which are considered development properties as they previously reached the permitting stage or operations stage.\nAs discussed, we are continuously surveying the market for opportunities to create future, long-term, contracts at favorable rates. However, long-term pricing remained weak in 2018 and we did not enter into any new contracts. As previously shown, the Company maintains a good book of contracts into 2021. The average contract price in 2018 was close to $50 per pound for the 470,000 pounds we sold under term contracts.\n\nAs at February 27, 2019, our unrestricted cash position was $6.4 million. Given our current cash resources, inventory position, contracted sales positions, and expected margins, we do not anticipate the need for additional funding in the near term unless it is advantageous to do so.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n 2. Non-cash costs include the amortization of the investment in the mineral property acquisition costs and the depreciation of plant equipment, and the depreciation of their related asset retirement obligation costs. The expenses are calculated on a straight-line basis, so the expenses are typically constant for each quarter. The cost per pound from these costs will therefore typically vary based on production levels only. \n\n2018 Developments\nThe DOC announced the commencement of its investigation in July 2018 and, to date, the trade action has proceeded through various phases of the investigation. In November 2018, as a part of the investigation, Lost Creek and several other uranium mines and mills were toured by the DOC investigation team.\n\nAs compared to 2017, our cost per pound sold decreased $3.19 to $24.76 in 2018. The decrease for the year was driven by the purchase of 470,000 pounds at an average price of $24.42. The cost per pound of produced product was $40.80.\nDevelopment expense includes $3.9 million of costs incurred at the Lost Creek Project not directly attributable to production activities, including wellfield construction, drilling and development costs. This is an increase of $1.9 million from 2016 and was related to the construction of the first three header houses in MU2 including the structures, wells and infrastructure. It also includes $0.4 million of costs associated with the Shirley Basin and Lucky Mc properties which are considered development properties as they previously reached the permitting stage or operations stage.\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents are composed of:\n 1. For comparative purposes, gross profit and gross profit per pound for the year 2016 excludes the profit recognized on the assignment of deliveries as well as the exclusion of NRV adjustments made in the years 2017 and 2018. \nChanges to Our Board of Directors\n\nShirley Basin Project\nAll of the original planned wells and 13 HHs in MU1 as well as three HHs and the related wells in MU2 have been completed and were available for operation at year end 2018. The first of the three HHs in MU2 began operations in August 2017; in January 2018, the second HH in MU2 came online; the third of the three MU2 HH started in 2017 came online in May 2018. Additional work in MU2 had been completed earlier, allowing for submittal of the appropriate operating permits. The main trunkline which has been installed services the first five MU2 HHs, and the entirety of MU2 has been fenced. All of these activities will allow for a quick turn-around to ramp up production once market fundamentals change.\nNote:\nThe cost of sales includes ad valorem and severance taxes related to the extraction of uranium, all costs of wellfield, plant and site operations including the related depreciation and amortization of capitalized assets, reclamation and mineral property costs, plus product distribution costs. These costs are also used to value inventory and the resulting inventoried cost per pound is compared to the estimated sales prices based on the contracts or spot sales anticipated for the distribution of the product. Any costs in excess of the calculated market value are charged to cost of sales.\nWellfield cash costs in 2018 Q1 were somewhat elevated due to some non-recurring expenses and the annual labor bonus in Q1. The average cash cost per pound captured increased to $9.50 in 2018 Q4 and averaged $6.84 for the year, as compared to $10.99 in 2017. The annual decrease was due to higher production levels during the year and a reduction in labor costs as we moved to maintenance-focused operations. As previously discussed, production levels were deliberately maintained at levels sufficient to satisfy our expected contract sales in light of the depressed uranium market. Wellfield non-cash costs were relatively fixed but lower than 2017 as a portion of the capitalized costs became fully depreciated in 2017. The resulting non-cash cost per pound captured was $8.28 in Q4 and averaged $5.31 for the year, as compared to $10.78 in 2017. The decrease for the year was significantly impacted by production levels which were higher than 2017.\nIn response to this persistently weak uranium market, we took aggressive measures in 2017 and 2018, and will again do so in 2019. In 2017, we deliberately slowed development activities at MU2, reduced costs, focused on enhancing production efficiencies from our operating MU1 HHs and complemented our production with cost effective purchases of uranium. In 2018, we implemented further cost reductions, purchased 100% of the uranium necessary to meet our 2018 contractual commitments, and increased our ending inventory position from 130 thousand pounds to 392 thousand pounds. For 2019, we have suspended further MU2 development activities, implemented further cost reductions, and secured purchase contracts for 100% of our 2019 delivery obligations.\nIndustry Update and Trends\nInvesting activities included receiving $3.5 million from the monetization of 2021 term contracts. The Lost Creek Project does not require significant capital expenditures and its sustaining capital expenditures have generally been less than $0.3 million per year.\nThere were no pounds sold in Q4. For the year, we sold 480,000 pounds, of which 470,000 were sold under term contracts at an average price per pound of $49.39 and 10,000 pounds were sold at a spot price of $23.75 per pound. Total uranium sales were $23.5 million at an average price per pound of $48.86. The 10,000 pounds sold at the spot rate were the only sales from produced inventory for the year.\nAfter more than five years of operations, Lost Creek captured 302,164 pounds captured during 2018 with a yearly average head grade of 31 ppm. The lower head grade and reduced flowrate during this period of operation is a typical result as a mine matures and older operating patterns, particularly in MU1 remain in the flow regime.\nIn April 2017, the Management Committee of the Bootheel Project determined to continue the ownership and maintenance on the Bootheel property for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018, which is the fiscal year end of The Bootheel Project, LLC. No additional exploration or development activities are expected at this time for 2018. Due to the continuing decline in the spot price of uranium combined with the reduction in minerals when a related lease was not renegotiated, the Company examined the valuation of the investment and determined that as a standalone investment, it had an insignificant value and was therefore fully impaired during 2016 resulting in a loss on investment of $1.1 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $43 thousand from disposal fees compared to $80 thousand during 2017.\n\nOperating costs in 2019 are expected to be lower than 2018 because of the suspended MU2 development activities. Other costs including capital expenditures and loan repayments will be similar to 2018.\n\nAs discussed elsewhere in this report, we completed the development of the third header house in Lost Creek's second mine unit, while continuing to control annual production rates at a modest target of 250,000 to 300,000 pounds. Production at Lost Creek in 2018 totaled 302,164 pounds captured in the plant. While U.S. miners lowered production rates and halted development ensuring near-term production will remain lower, imports continued to dominate the U.S. market in 2018. Projections at year end suggest that U.S. uranium miners accounted for less than two percent of domestic uranium needs.\nWe sold a total of 780,000 pounds of U3O8 during the year ended December 31, 2017 for an average price of $49.09 per pound as compared to 2016 when we sold 562,000 pounds for an average price of $39.49. The fluctuation in sales prices relates primarily to lower priced spot sales made in 2016 as well as the fulfillment of some lower-priced, shorter-term contracts in 2016. In 2016, we assigned two contract deliveries totaling 200,000 pounds of U3O8 to a third-party trader. The deliveries were made during 2016 and we recognized $5.1 million in sales from those contracts.", "item_7_tables": "Table 64: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr>

that operates the Lost Creek uranium project in Wyoming. \n\n- In 2018, Ur-Energy sold 480,000 pounds of U3O8 for total sales of $23.5 million. The average sales price was $48.86 per pound. \n\n- Production at Lost Creek in 2018 was 302,164 pounds of U3O8 captured. Total inventory at the end of 2018 was about 375,803 pounds.\n\n- Cost of sales for 2018 totaled $11.9 million, comprised of $11.5 million for purchased uranium and $0.4 million of production costs. The cash cost per pound of produced uranium was $16.48. \n\n- Gross profit for 2018 was $11.3 million, representing a 48% gross margin. This improved from 36% in 2017 due to purchasing most of the uranium sold rather than producing it.\n\n- Operating expenses decreased by $2.6 million in 2018 compared to 2017, due to reductions in exploration, development, G&A, and mineral property expenses. \n\n- Net income for 2018 was $4.5 million or $0.03 per share, versus a net loss in 2017.\n\n- Lost Creek does not require significant capital expenditures currently. The focus is on producing to meet existing contracts and controlling costs.\n\n- Ur-Energy has contractual uranium sales of 500,000 pounds for 2019 at around $49 per pound. It has secured purchase contracts to supply this uranium at around $26 per pound.\n\n- The company continues to pursue trade remedies to address unfair uranium imports to the US. The outcome of this process is still uncertain.\n\nIn summary, Ur-Energy increased profitability in 2018 through purchased uranium to meet contracts versus higher cost production. The company is focused on cost control and maintaining operational readiness until uranium prices improve."}
