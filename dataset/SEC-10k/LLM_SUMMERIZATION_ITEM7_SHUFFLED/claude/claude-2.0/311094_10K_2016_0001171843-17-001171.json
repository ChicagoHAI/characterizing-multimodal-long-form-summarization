MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of Westamerica Bancorporation and subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. It should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages 48 through 88, as well as with the other information presented throughout this Report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires the Company to make certain estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, Management has identified the allowance for loan losses accounting to be the accounting area requiring the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. A discussion of the factors affecting accounting for the allowance for loan losses and purchased loans is included in the Loan Portfolio Credit Risk\u201d discussion below.\nNet Income\nThe Company's principal source of revenue is net interest income, which represents interest earned on loans and investment securities ( earning assets\u201d) reduced by interest paid on deposits and other borrowings ( interest-bearing liabilities\u201d). The relatively low level of market interest rates during the five years ended December 31, 2016 has reduced the spread between interest rates on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The Company's net interest margin and net interest income declined as market interest rates on newly originated loans remain below the yields earned on older-dated loans and on the overall loan portfolio.\nThe Company's loan portfolio has declined from 2012 through 2016; Management has been avoiding long-dated, low-yielding loans given historically low interest rates. Management has also maintained, in their opinion, conservative loan underwriting, terms and conditions. During this period, the investment securities portfolio has grown. The Company has been reducing its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing shorter-duration investment securities, which have lower yields than longer-duration securities. The changing composition of interest earning assets and low market interest rates has pressured the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent ( FTE\u201d) basis. In 2016 the Company's average checking and savings deposits were 5 percent higher than in 2015. These lower-costing deposit products, which earn relatively low interest rates and are less volatile than time deposits during periods of rising market interest rates, represented 94 percent of average total deposits in 2016. Credit quality improved with nonperforming assets declining to $12.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $24.6 million at December 31, 2015. Reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including improvements in most credit metrics the Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million in 2016. Management is focused on controlling all noninterest expense levels, particularly due to market interest rate pressure on net interest income. Noninterest expenses declined to $101.8 million in 2016 compared to $105.3 million in 2015.\nThe Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on an FTE basis using the current statutory federal tax rate, which is a non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measure. Management believes the FTE basis is valuable to the reader because the Company's loan and investment securities portfolios contain a relatively large portion of municipal loans and securities that generate interest income which is exempt from federal income tax. The Company's tax exempt loans and securities composition may not be similar to that of other banks; therefore in order to reflect the impact of the federally tax exempt loans and securities on the net interest margin and net interest income for comparability with other banks, the Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on an FTE basis.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-19- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported net income of $58.9 million or $2.29 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with net income of $58.8 million or $2.30 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015 and net income of $60.6 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nComponents of Net Income\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands, except per share data) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest and loan fee income (FTE) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152,656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reversal of (provision for) loan losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,800 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,574 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,787 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(101,752 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(105,300 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(106,799 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income before income taxes (FTE) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,844 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income taxes (FTE) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,246 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,072 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,198 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,853 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,646 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income per average fully-diluted common share </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income as a percentage of average shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income as a percentage of average total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparing 2016 with 2015, net income increased $100 thousand due to a reversal of provision for loan losses and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest and fee income (FTE), lower noninterest income and higher income tax provision (FTE). The lower net interest and fee income (FTE) was primarily caused by lower average balances of loans, partially offset by higher average balances of investments and lower average balances of higher-costing time deposits. The Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million, reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to reduced levels of service charges on deposit accounts, financial services commissions and other service fees, partially offset by higher debit card fees. Noninterest expense decreased mostly due to lower personnel expense, lower occupancy expense, and lower other operating expense, offset in part by higher legal fees. Income tax provision (FTE) increased in 2016 due to higher pretax income, declining tax preference items and lower tax credits.\nComparing 2015 with 2014, net income decreased $1.9 million or 3.1%, primarily due to lower net interest and loan fee income (FTE) and lower noninterest income, partially offset by decreases in loan loss provision, noninterest expense and income tax provision (FTE). The lower net interest and loan fee income (FTE) was primarily caused by a lower average volume of loans and lower yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher average balances of investments and lower average balances of higher-costing interest-bearing liabilities. The provision for loan losses was reduced, reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio; net loan losses and nonperforming loan volumes have declined relative to earlier periods. Lower noninterest income was mostly attributable to lower merchant processing service fees and lower service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to reduced personnel costs and other operational expenses.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-20- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Interest and Loan Fee Income (FTE)\nThe Company's primary source of revenue is net interest income, or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings.\nComponents of Net Interest and Loan Fee Income (FTE)\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest and loan fee income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>134,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>136,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,209 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,116 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,424 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,444 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FTE adjustment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,891 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest and loan fee income (FTE) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,258 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>152,656 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin (FTE) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparing 2016 with 2015, net interest and loan fee income (FTE) decreased $3.2 million due to lower average balances of loans (down $194 million), partially offset by higher average balances of investments (up $255 million) and lower average balances of higher-costing time deposits (down $62 million).\nComparing 2015 with 2014, net interest and fee income (FTE) decreased $4.4 million or 2.9% primarily due to a lower average volume of loans (down $155 million) and lower yields on interest-earning assets (FTE) (down 37 basis points bp\u201d), partially offset by higher average balances of investments (up $436 million) and lower average balances of higher-costing interest-bearing liabilities.\nLoan volumes have declined due to problem loan workout activities (such as chargeoffs, collateral repossessions and principal payments), particularly with purchased loans, and reduced volumes of loan originations. In Management's opinion, current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential. As a result, the Company has not currently taken an aggressive posture relative to loan portfolio growth. Management has increased investment securities as loan volumes have declined. The average balance of the investment securities portfolio increased from $2.4 billion in 2014 to $2.8 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2016. The Company, in anticipation of rising interest rates, has been purchasing floating rate and shorter-duration investment securities with lower yields than longer-duration securities to increase liquidity. The Company's high levels of liquidity will provide an opportunity to obtain higher yielding assets assuming market interest rates start rising.\nYields on interest-earning assets declined due to historically low interest rates prevailing in the market. The net interest margin (FTE) was 3.24% in 2016, 3.36% in 2015 and 3.70% in 2014. The volume of older-dated higher-yielding loans and securities declined due to principal maturities and paydowns. Newly originated loans have lower yields. As the investment securities portfolio grew during the three years ended December 31, 2016, the investment securities portfolio generated an increasing portion of the interest income (FTE). Interest income (FTE) generated from investments represented 41.8% of total interest income (FTE) in 2014, 47.0% in 2015 and 52.2% in 2016. During the three years ended December 31, 2016, the net interest margin (FTE) was affected by low market interest rates and the changing composition of interest-earning assets.\nThe Company has been replacing higher-cost funding sources with low-cost deposits and interest expense has declined to offset some of the decline in interest income. Interest expense has been reduced by lowering rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings and by reducing the volume of higher-cost funding sources. A $10 million term repurchase agreement was repaid in August 2014 and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances were repaid in January 2015. Average balances of time deposits declined $62 million in 2016 compared with 2015 while lower-cost checking and savings deposits grew 5% in the same period. Lower-cost checking and savings deposits accounted for 94.1% of total average deposits in 2016 compared with 92.5% in 2015 and 89.8% in 2014.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-21- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSummary of Average Balances, Yields/Rates and Interest Differential\nThe following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity, the amounts of interest income earned from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields, and the amounts of interest expense incurred on average interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting rates.

underwriting and administration procedures and aggressively pursuing collection efforts with debtors experiencing financial difficulties. The provision for loan losses reflects Management's assessment of credit risk in the loan portfolio during each of the periods presented.\nThe Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million in 2016. The Company provided no provision for loan losses in 2015 compared with $2.8 million in 2014. During 2016, classified loans declined $17.1 million (which included nonperforming loans of $8.9 million). The Company's net losses of prior loan losses decreased from $3.0 million in 2014 and $1.7 million in 2015 to $617 thousand in 2016; these developments were reflected in Management's evaluation of credit quality, the level of the provision for loan losses, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016. Management's evaluation of credit quality includes originated and purchased loans. The Company recorded purchased loans at estimated fair value upon the acquisition dates. Such estimated fair values were recognized for individual loans, although small balance homogenous loans were pooled for valuation purposes. The valuation discounts recorded for purchased loans included Management's assessment of the risk of principal loss under economic and borrower conditions prevailing on the dates of purchase. The purchased County Bank loans secured by single-family residential real estate are covered\u201d through February 6, 2019 by loss-sharing agreements the Company entered with the FDIC which mitigates losses during the term of the agreements. Any deterioration in estimated value related to principal loss subsequent to the acquisition dates requires additional loss recognition through a provision for loan losses. No assurance can be given future provisions for loan losses related to purchased loans will not be necessary.

Service charges on deposits decreased $1.4 million due to declines in fees charged on overdrawn and insufficient funds accounts (down $1.1 million) and lower fees on analyzed accounts (down $393 thousand), partially offset by the effect of deposit fee increases effective February 2016. The decrease was partially offset by increased debit card fees of $206 thousand as a result of increased transaction volumes.\nIn 2015, noninterest income decreased $3.9 million or 7.6% compared with 2014. Service charges on deposits decreased $2.0 million compared with 2014 due to declines in fees charged on overdrawn and insufficient funds accounts (down $913 thousand), lower fees on analyzed accounts (down $661 thousand) and lower activity on checking accounts (down $325 thousand). Merchant processing services declined $880 thousand primarily due to lower transaction volumes.\nNoninterest Expense\nComponents of Noninterest Expense\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Salaries and related benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,777 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Occupancy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,116 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,960 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,992 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Outsourced data processing services </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,411 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Furniture and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,434 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,174 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,346 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Courier service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(479 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(642 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,847 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,752 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>105,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106,799 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2016, noninterest expense decreased $3.5 million or 3.4% compared with 2015. Expenses for other real estate owned in 2016 were reduced by net gains from the sale of foreclosed properties. Occupancy expense decreased $844 thousand in 2016 compared with 2015 mostly due to branch closures and a lease expiration related to a non-branch building. Salaries and related benefits decreased $685 thousand primarily due to employee attrition, offset in part by higher expenses for stock based compensation. Courier expense decreased $377 thousand primarily due to logistical changes and switching to new vendors. Amortization of identifiable intangibles decreased $352 thousand as assets are amortized on a declining balance method. Other operating expense decreased $2.3 million primarily due to lower expenses for correspondent service fees (down $1.3 million), FDIC insurance assessments (down $535 thousand) and operating losses on limited partnership investments (down $375 thousand). Two categories of expense offset the decrease: Professional fees increased $1.5 million due to higher legal fees associated with loan administration and collection activities. Furniture and equipment expense increased $467 thousand mainly due to increased depreciation costs for technology.\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-27- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015, noninterest expense decreased $1.5 million or 1.4% compared with 2014 primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and other operational expenses. Salaries and related benefits decreased $2.6 million primarily due to employee attrition. Amortization of identifiable intangibles decreased as assets are amortized on a declining balance method. Courier expense decreased primarily due to consolidating service runs. OREO expense in 2015 included net writedowns while in 2014 the Company realized net gains on disposition of foreclosed assets. Furniture and equipment expense increased primarily due to higher depreciation costs resulting from computer and software upgrades and higher software license fees.\nProvision for Income Tax\nThe income tax provision (FTE) was $34.2 million in 2016 compared with $32.1 million in 2015 and $34.2 million in 2014. The 2016 effective tax rate (FTE) was 36.8% compared with 35.3% in 2015 and 36.1% in 2014. The effective tax rates without FTE adjustments were 26.4% for 2016 and 23.4% for 2015 and 23.2% for 2014. The effective tax rates for 2016 were higher than the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 due to higher pre-tax income and declining tax preference items. Interest income earned on municipal securities and tax free loans which are exempt from federal income taxes have declined in 2016. The tax credits earned from investments in limited partnerships have also declined in 2016.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nThe Company maintains an investment securities portfolio consisting of securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities, agency and non-agency mortgage backed securities, state and political subdivisions, corporations, and asset-backed and other securities. Investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian.\nManagement has increased the investment securities portfolio in response to deposit growth and loan volume declines. The carrying value of the Company's investment securities portfolio was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $351 million compared to December 31, 2015.\nManagement continually evaluates the Company's investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, liquidity, and the level of interest rate risk to which the Company is exposed. These evaluations may cause Management to change the level of funds the Company deploys into investment securities and change the composition of the Company's investment securities portfolio. In 2016 Management reduced securities of U.S. Government sponsored entities to reduce call optionality and increased agency residential MBS to develop more reliable cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2016, substantially all of the Company's investment securities continue to be investment grade rated by one or more major rating agencies. In addition to monitoring credit rating agency evaluations, Management performs its own evaluations regarding the credit worthiness of the issuer or the securitized assets underlying asset-backed securities. The Company's procedures for evaluating investments in securities are in accordance with guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Investing in Securities without Reliance on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Agencies\u201d (SR 12-15) and other regulatory guidance. Credit ratings are considered in our analysis only as a guide to the historical default rate associated with similarly-rated bonds. There have been no significant differences in our internal analyses compared with the ratings assigned by the third party credit rating agencies.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-28- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the fair value carrying amount of the Company's investment securities available for sale as of the dates indicated:\nAvailable for Sale Portfolio\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. Treasury securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,505 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Securities of U.S. Government sponsored entities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>138,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301,882 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>635,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Agency residential mortgage-backed securities (MBS) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>691,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>202,544 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248,258 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-agency residential MBS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>606 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-agency commercial MBS </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,025 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,919 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Obligations of states and political subdivisions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,799 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset-backed securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>FHLMC(1) and FNMA(2) stock </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,329 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,168 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Corporate securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>860,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>896,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512,239 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,471 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,831 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,786 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,890,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,570,216 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,600,781 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\n(2) Federal National Mortgage Association\nThe following table sets forth the relative maturities and contractual yields of the Company's available for sale securities (stated at fair value) at December 31, 2016.

Management follows written loan underwriting policies and procedures which are approved by the Bank's Board of Directors. Loans are underwritten following approved underwriting standards and lending authorities within a formalized organizational structure. The Board of Directors also approves independent real estate appraisers to be used in obtaining estimated values for real property serving as loan collateral. Prevailing economic trends and conditions are also taken into consideration in loan underwriting practices.\nAll loan applications must be for clearly defined legitimate purposes with a determinable primary source of repayment, and as appropriate, secondary sources of repayment. All loans are supported by appropriate documentation such as current financial statements, tax returns, credit reports, collateral information, guarantor asset verification, title reports, appraisals, and other relevant documentation.\nCommercial loans represent term loans used to acquire durable business assets or revolving lines of credit used to finance working capital. Underwriting practices evaluate each borrower's cash flow as the principal source of loan repayment. Commercial loans are generally secured by the borrower's business assets as a secondary source of repayment. Commercial loans are evaluated for credit-worthiness based on prior loan performance, borrower financial information including cash flow, borrower net worth and aggregate debt.\nCommercial real estate loans represent term loans used to acquire real estate to be operated by the borrower in a commercial capacity. Underwriting practices evaluate each borrower's global cash flow as the principal source of loan repayment, independent appraisal of value of the property, and other relevant factors. Commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first lien on the property as a secondary source of repayment.\nReal estate construction loans represent the financing of real estate development. Loan principal disbursements are controlled through the use of project budgets, and disbursements are approved based on construction progress, which is validated by project site inspections. A first lien on the real estate serves as collateral to secure the loan.\nResidential real estate loans generally represent first lien mortgages used by the borrower to purchase or refinance a principal residence. For interest-rate risk purposes, the Company offers only fully-amortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages. In underwriting first lien mortgages, the Company evaluates each borrower's ability to repay the loan, an independent appraisal of the value of the property, and other relevant factors. The Company does not offer riskier mortgage products, such as non-amortizing interest-only\u201d mortgages and negative amortization\u201d mortgages.\nFor loans secured by real estate, the Bank requires title insurance to insure the status of its lien and each borrower is obligated to insure the real estate collateral, naming the Company as loss payee, in an amount sufficient to repay the principal amount outstanding in the event of a property casualty loss.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-33- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsumer installment and other loans are predominantly comprised of indirect automobile loans with underwriting based on credit history and scores, personal income, debt service capacity, and collateral values.\nFor management purposes, the Company segregates its loan portfolio into three segments. Loans originated by the Company following its loan underwriting policies and procedures are separated from loans purchased from the FDIC. Loan volumes have declined due to problem loan workout activities, particularly with purchased loans, and reduced volumes of loan originations. In Management's opinion, current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential.

Such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs. Occasionally, such commitments are in the form of letters of credit to facilitate the customers' particular business transactions. Commitment fees are generally charged for commitments and letters of credit. Commitments on lines of credit and letters of credit typically mature within one year. For further information, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nLoan Portfolio Credit Risk\nThe Company extends loans to commercial and consumer customers which expose the Company to the risk borrowers will default, causing loan losses. The Company's lending activities are exposed to various qualitative risks. All loan segments are exposed to risks inherent in the economy and market conditions. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial loan segment include the borrowers' business performance and financial condition, and the value of collateral for secured loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial real estate segment include the borrowers' business performance and the value of properties collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the construction loan segment include the borrowers' performance in successfully developing the real estate into the intended purpose and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the residential real estate segment include the borrowers' financial wherewithal to service the mortgages and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the consumer loan segment include the financial condition of the borrowers and the value of collateral securing the loans.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-34- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires Management to estimate the amount of losses inherent in the loan portfolio and establish an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established by assessing a provision for loan losses against the Company's earnings. In estimating credit losses, Management must exercise judgment in evaluating information deemed relevant, such as financial information regarding individual borrowers, overall credit loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other information. The amount of ultimate losses on the loan portfolio can vary from the estimated amounts. Management follows a systematic methodology to estimate loss potential in an effort to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses.\nThe Company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and follows a strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk. The Bank's organization structure separates the functions of business development and loan underwriting; Management believes this segregation of duties avoids inherent conflicts of combining business development and loan approval functions. In measuring and managing credit risk, the Company adheres to the following practices.\nTable 105: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The Bank maintains a Loan Review Department which reports directly to the Board of Directors. The Loan Review Department performs independent evaluations of loans and assigns credit risk grades to evaluated loans using grading standards employed by bank regulatory agencies. Those loans judged to carry higher risk attributes are referred to as classified loans.\u201d Classified loans receive elevated management attention to maximize collection. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The Bank maintains two loan administration offices whose sole responsibility is to manage and collect classified loans. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClassified loans with higher levels of credit risk are further designated as nonaccrual loans.\u201d Management places classified loans on nonaccrual status when full collection of contractual interest and principal payments is in doubt. Uncollected interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is reversed as a charge against interest income. The Company does not accrue interest income on loans following placement on nonaccrual status. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the loan unless the carrying amount is well secured by loan collateral. Nonperforming assets\u201d include nonaccrual loans, loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing, and repossessed loan collateral (commonly referred to as Other Real Estate Owned\u201d).\nThe former County Bank loans and repossessed loan collateral were purchased from the FDIC with indemnifying loss-sharing agreements. The loss-sharing agreement on single-family residential real estate assets expires February 6, 2019. The loss-sharing agreement on non-single-family residential real estate assets expired February 6, 2014 as to losses and expired February 6, 2017 as to loss recoveries.\n[The remainder of this page

due to payoffs and chargeoffs. At December 31, 2016, one loan secured by commercial real estate with a balance of $4.4 million was on nonaccrual status. The remaining thirteen nonaccrual loans held at December 31, 2016 had an average carrying value of $306 thousand and the largest carrying value was $1.3 million.\nManagement believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio is reasonably stable; however, classified and nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period. The performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment, economic conditions, and collateral values or factors particular to the borrower. No assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual and delinquent loans will not occur in the future.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-36- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses represents Management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. In evaluating credit risk for loans, Management measures loss potential of the carrying value of loans. As described above, payments received on nonaccrual loans may be applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected. Further, the carrying value of purchased loans includes fair value discounts assigned at the time of purchase under the provisions of FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, and FASB ASC 310-30, Loans or Debt Securities with Deteriorated Credit Quality. The allowance for loan losses represents Management's estimate of loan losses in excess of these reductions to the carrying value of loans within the loan portfolio.\nThe following table summarizes

These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall loan loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, the amount of non-indemnified purchased loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. A portion of the allowance is individually allocated to impaired loans whose full collectability of principal is uncertain. Such allocations are determined by Management based on loan-by-loan analyses. The Company evaluates for impairment all loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of $500 thousand which are classified or on nonaccrual status and all troubled debt restructured\u201d loans. The remainder of the loan portfolio is collectively evaluated for impairment based in part on quantitative analyses of historical loan loss experience of loan portfolio segments to determine standard loss rates for each segment. The loss rate for each loan portfolio segment reflects both the historical loss experience during a look-back period and the loss emergence period. The loss rates are applied to segmented loan balances to allocate the allowance to the segments of the loan portfolio.\nPurchased loans were recorded on the date of purchase at estimated fair value; fair value discounts include a component for estimated loan losses. The Company evaluates all nonaccrual purchased loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of $500 thousand for impairment; the impaired loan value is compared to the recorded investment in the loan, which has been reduced by the loan default discount estimated on the date of purchase. If Management's impairment analysis determines the impaired loan value is less than the recorded investment in the purchased loan, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for the deficiency. For all other purchased loan portfolio segments, Management applies loss rates to the purchased loan portfolio segments to determine initial allocations of the allowance. Further, liquidating purchased consumer installment loans are evaluated separately by applying historical loss rates to forecasted liquidating principal balances to initially measure losses inherent in this portfolio segment. The initial allocations of the allowance to purchased loan portfolio segments are compared to loan default discounts ascribed to each segment. Management establishes allocations of the allowance for loan losses for any estimated deficiency.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-37- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated. The unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance. The unallocated allowance addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with Management's analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio, which are related to the risks of the Company's general lending activity. Included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have not yet been recognized in loan chargeoff history (external factors). The primary external factor evaluated by the Company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by Management as of December 31, 2016 is economic and business conditions $0.7 million. Also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the Company's loan portfolio and credit administration (internal factors). The internal factors evaluated by the Company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by Management are: loan review system $1.4 million, adequacy of lending Management and staff $1.1 million and concentrations of credit $1.3 million.\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31 for the years indicated:\nTable 112: <table>

</tr>\n</table>\nThe decline in the unallocated allowance for loan losses during 2016 was generally due to the overall improved economic conditions and credit quality metrics.\nManagement considers the $26.0 million allowance for loan losses to be adequate as a reserve against loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016.\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the loan portfolio, loan portfolio credit risk, and allowance for loan losses.\nAsset/Liability and Market Risk Management\nAsset/liability management involves the evaluation, monitoring and management of interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. The fundamental objective of the Company's management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk.\nInterest Rate Risk\nInterest rate risk is a significant market risk affecting the Company. Many factors affect the Company's exposure to interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Assets and liabilities may mature or re-price at different times. Assets and liabilities may re-price at the same time but by different amounts. Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. The timing and amount of cash flows of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. In addition, the changing levels of interest rates may have an impact on loan demand, demand for various deposit products, credit losses, and other elements of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts and correspondent bank service charges.\nThe Company's earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board (the FRB\u201d). The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable.\nManagement expects a high level of uncertainty in regard to interest rate levels in the immediate term, and Management's most likely earnings forecast for the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 assumes market interest rates will gradually rise, with short-term rates rising more than long-term rates.\nIn adjusting the Company's asset/liability position, Management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin and net interest income. At times, depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates, the relationship between long and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, Management may adjust the Company's interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income. The Company's results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short-term interest rates.\nThe Company's asset and liability position was neutral\u201d to slightly asset sensitive\u201d at December 31, 2016, depending on the interest rate assumptions applied to the simulation model employed by Management to measure interest rate risk. An asset sensitive\u201d position results in a slightly larger change in interest income than in interest expense resulting from application of assumed interest rate changes. Simulation estimates depend on, and will change with, the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation. Management continues to monitor the interest rate environment as well as economic conditions and other factors it deems relevant in managing the Company's exposure to interest rate risk.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-39- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk, even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the Company's Board of Directors.\nMarket Risk - Equity Markets\nEquity price risk can affect the Company. As an example, any preferred or common stock holdings, as permitted by banking regulations, can fluctuate in value. Management regularly assesses the extent and duration of any declines in market value, the causes of such declines, the likelihood of a recovery in market value, and its intent to hold securities until a recovery in value occurs. Declines in value of preferred or common stock holdings that are deemed other than temporary\u201d could result in loss recognition in the Company's income statement.\nFluctuations in the Company's common stock price can impact the Company's financial results in several ways. First, the Company has regularly repurchased and retired its common stock; the market price paid to retire the Company's common stock affects the level of the Company's shareholders' equity, cash flows and shares outstanding. Second, the Company's common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share. Third, fluctuations in the Company's common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase Company common stock through the exercise of such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding. Finally, the amount of compensation expense associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the Company's common stock price.\nMarket Risk - Other\nMarket values of loan collateral can directly impact the level of loan chargeoffs and the provision for loan losses. The financial condition and liquidity of debtors issuing bonds and debtors whose mortgages or other obligations are securitized can directly impact the credit quality of the Company's investment securities portfolio requiring the Company to recognize other than temporary impairment charges. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk, are not significant in the normal course of the Company's business activities.\nLiquidity and Funding\nThe objective of liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund the Company's operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The Company achieves this objective through the selection of asset and liability maturity mixes that it believes best meet its needs. The Company's liquidity position is enhanced by its ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets.\nIn recent years, the Company's deposit base has provided the majority of the Company's funding requirements. This relatively stable and low-cost source of funds, along with shareholders' equity, provided 98 percent of funding for average total assets in 2016 and 97 percent in 2015. The stability of the Company's funding from customer deposits is in part reliant on the confidence clients have in the Company. The Company places a very high priority in maintaining this confidence through conservative credit and capital management practices and by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity reserves.\nLiquidity is further provided by assets such as balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities, and amortizing loans. The Company's investment securities portfolio provides a substantial secondary liquidity reserve. The Company held $3.2 billion in total investment securities at December 31, 2016. Under certain deposit, borrowing and other arrangements, the Company must hold and pledge investment securities as collateral. At December 31, 2016, such collateral requirements totaled approximately $769 million.\nLiquidity risk can result from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows, or from disruptions in the financial markets. The Company performs liquidity stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its liquidity. Under the stress testing, the Company assumes outflows of funds increase beyond expected levels. Measurement of such heightened outflows considers the composition of the Company's deposit base, including any concentration of deposits, non-deposit funding such as short-term borrowings, and unfunded lending commitments. The Company evaluates its stock of highly liquid assets to meet the assumed higher levels of outflows. Highly liquid assets include cash and amounts due from other banks from daily transaction settlements, reduced by branch cash needs and Federal Reserve Bank reserve requirements, and investment securities based on regulatory risk-weighting guidelines. Based on the results of the most recent liquidity stress test, Management is satisfied with the liquidity condition of the Bank and the Company. However, no assurance can be given the Bank or Company will not experience a period of reduced liquidity.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-40- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement will monitor the Company's cash levels throughout 2017. Loan demand from credit worthy borrowers will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions. The Company aggressively solicits non-interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposits, which are the least sensitive to changes in interest rates. The growth of these deposit balances is subject to heightened competition, the success of the Company's sales efforts, delivery of superior customer service, new regulations and market conditions. The Company does not aggressively solicit higher-costing time deposits; as a result, Management anticipates such deposits will decline. Changes in interest rates, most notably rising interest rates, could impact deposit volumes. Depending on economic conditions, interest rate levels, liquidity management and a variety of other conditions, deposit growth may be used to fund loans or purchase investment securities. However, due to possible volatility in economic conditions, competition and political uncertainty, loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain. Shareholder dividends are expected to continue subject to the Board's discretion and continuing evaluation of capital levels, earnings, asset quality and other factors.\nWestamerica Bancorporation (\"Parent Company\") is a separate entity apart from Westamerica Bank ( Bank\u201d) and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Parent Company is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its shareholders, and interest and principal on any outstanding debt. Substantially all of the Parent Company's revenues are obtained from subsidiary dividends and service fees.\nThe Bank's dividends paid to the Parent Company and proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided adequate cash flow for the Parent Company to pay shareholder dividends of $40 million in 2016, $39 million in 2015 and $40 million in 2014, and retire common stock in the amount of $6 million, $15 million and $53 million, respectively. Payment of dividends to the Parent Company by the Bank is limited under California and Federal laws. The Company believes these regulatory dividend restrictions will not have an impact on the Parent Company's ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth the known contractual obligations, except short-term borrowing arrangements and post-retirement benefit plans, of the Company:\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, 2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Within One Year </td> <td> </td> <td>Over One to Three Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Over Three to Five Years </td> <td> </td> <td>After Five Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating Lease Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,766 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Purchase Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,556 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41,738 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,355 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,691 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,504 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $2 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases. Operating lease obligations may be retired prior to the contractual maturity as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The purchase obligation consists of the Company's minimum liabilities under contracts with third-party automation services providers .\nCapital Resources\nThe Company has historically generated high levels of earnings, which provide a means of accumulating capital. The Company's net income as a percentage of average shareholders' equity ( return on equity\u201d or ROE\u201d) has been 10.9% in 2016, 11.3% in 2015 and 11.6% in 2014. The Company also raises capital as employees exercise stock options. Capital raised through the exercise of stock options was $24 million in 2016 compared with $5 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014.\nThe Company paid common dividends totaling $40 million in 2016, $39 million in 2015 and $40 million in 2014, which represent dividends per common share of $1.56, $1.53 and $1.52, respectively. The Company's earnings have historically exceeded dividends paid to shareholders. The amount of earnings in excess of dividends provides the Company resources to finance growth and maintain appropriate levels of shareholders' equity. In the absence of profitable growth opportunities, the Company has repurchased and retired its common stock as another means to return earnings to shareholders. The Company repurchased and retired 137 thousand shares valued at $6 million in 2016, 344 thousand shares valued at $15 million in 2015 and 1.0 million shares valued at $53 million in 2014.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-41- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's primary capital resource is shareholders' equity, which was $561 million at December 31, 2016 compared with $532 million at December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of equity to total assets was 10.46% at December 31, 2016 and 10.30% at December 31, 2015.\nThe Company performs capital stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its capital. Under the stress testing, the Company assumes various scenarios such as deteriorating economic and operating conditions, unanticipated asset devaluations, and significant operational lapses. The Company measures the impact of these scenarios on its earnings and capital. Based on the results of the most recent stress tests, Management is satisfied with the capital condition of the Bank and the Company. However, no assurance can be given the Bank or Company will not experience a period of reduced earnings or a reduction in capital from unanticipated events and circumstances.\nCapital to Risk-Adjusted Assets\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule that implements changes to the regulatory capital framework for all banking organizations. The rule's provisions which most affected the regulatory capital requirements of the Company and the Bank:\nTable 120: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Introduced a new Common Equity Tier 1\u201d capital measurement, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Established higher minimum levels of capital, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Introduced a capital conservation buffer,\u201d </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Increased the risk-weighting of certain assets, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Established limits on the amount of deferred tax assets with any excess treated as a deduction from Tier 1 capital. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnder the final rule, a banking organization that is not subject to the advanced approaches rule\u201d may make a one-time election not to include most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, including net-of-tax unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities, in regulatory capital. Neither the Company nor the Bank is subject to the advanced approaches rule\u201d and both made the election not to include most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in regulatory capital.\nBanking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches rule\u201d began complying with the final rule on January 1, 2015; on such date, the Company and the Bank became subject to the revised definitions of regulatory capital, the new minimum regulatory capital ratios, and various regulatory capital adjustments and deductions according to transition provisions and timelines. All banking organizations began calculating standardized total risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2015. The transition period for the capital conservation buffer for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016 and will end January 1, 2019. Any bank subject to the rule which is unable to maintain its capital conservation buffer\u201d will be restricted in the payment of discretionary executive compensation and shareholder distributions, such as dividends and share repurchases.\nThe final rule did not supersede provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requiring federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action (PCA) to resolve problems of insured depository institutions.

Based on current capital projections, the Company and the Bank expect to maintain regulatory capital levels exceeding the highest effective regulatory standard and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders. No assurance can be given that changes in capital management plans will not occur.\nDeposit Categories\nThe Company primarily attracts deposits from local businesses and professionals, as well as through retail savings and checking accounts, and, to a more limited extent, certificates of deposit.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's average daily amount of deposits and the rates paid for the periods indicated:\nDeposit Distribution and Average Rates Paid\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> <td> </td> <td>Average Balance </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>($ In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Noninterest-bearing demand </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,026,939 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,968,817 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,841,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest bearing: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transaction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>862,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>822,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>790,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.03 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Savings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,428,059 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,312,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.06 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,215,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time less than $100 thousand </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>197,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Time $100 thousand or more </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118,750 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>161,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>237,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.38 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,590,351 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,437,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,281,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.07 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) The rates for total deposits reflect value of noninterest-bearing deposits.\nThe Company's strategy includes building the value of its deposit base by building balances of lower-costing deposits and avoiding reliance on higher-costing time deposits.

The Company's average balances of checking and savings accounts represented 94% of average balances of total deposits in 2016 compared with 93% in 2015 and 90% in 2014.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nTable 129: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>-43- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal time deposits were $256 million and $287 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

principal residence. For interest-rate risk purposes, the Company offers only fully-amortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages. In underwriting first lien mortgages, the Company evaluates each borrower's ability to repay the loan, an independent appraisal of the value of the property, and other relevant factors. The Company does not offer riskier mortgage products, such as non-amortizing interest-only\u201d mortgages and negative amortization\u201d mortgages.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

interest earned on loans and investment securities ( earning assets\u201d) reduced by interest paid on deposits and other borrowings ( interest-bearing liabilities\u201d). The relatively low level of market interest rates during the five years ended December 31, 2016 has reduced the spread between interest rates on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The Company's net interest margin and net interest income declined as market interest rates on newly originated loans remain below the yields earned on older-dated loans and on the overall loan

Management has also maintained, in their opinion, conservative loan underwriting, terms and conditions. During this period, the investment securities portfolio has grown. The Company has been reducing its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing shorter-duration investment securities, which have lower yields than longer-duration securities. The changing composition of interest earning assets and low market interest rates has pressured the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent ( FTE\u201d) basis. In 2016 the Company's average checking and savings deposits were 5 percent higher than in 2015. These lower-costing deposit products, which earn relatively low interest rates and are less volatile than time deposits during periods of rising market interest rates, represented 94 percent of average total deposits in 2016. Credit quality improved with nonperforming assets declining to $12.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $24.6 million at December 31, 2015. Reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including improvements in most credit metrics the Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million in 2016. Management is focused on controlling all noninterest expense levels, particularly due to market interest rate pressure on net interest income. Noninterest expenses declined to $101.8 million in 2016 compared to $105.3 million in 2015.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, 2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(In thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,828 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,621 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,345 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,886 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>256,170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan Maturity Distribution\nReal estate construction loans represent the financing of real estate development.

At December 31, 2016, one loan secured by commercial real estate with a balance of $4.4 million was on nonaccrual status. The remaining thirteen nonaccrual loans held at December 31, 2016 had an average carrying value of $306 thousand and the largest carrying value was $1.3 million.\n\nThe Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on an FTE basis using the current statutory federal tax rate, which is a non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measure. Management believes the FTE basis is valuable to the reader because the Company's loan and investment securities portfolios contain a relatively large portion of municipal loans and securities that generate interest income which is exempt from federal income tax. The Company's tax exempt loans and securities composition may not be similar to that of other banks; therefore in order to reflect the impact of the federally tax exempt loans and securities on the net interest margin and net interest income for comparability with other banks, the Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on an FTE basis.\nThe capital ratios for the Company and the Bank under the new capital framework are presented in the table below, on the dates indicated.\nInterest rate risk is a significant market risk affecting the Company. Many factors affect the Company's exposure to interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Assets and liabilities may mature or re-price at different times. Assets and liabilities may re-price at the same time but by different amounts. Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. The timing and amount of cash flows of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. In addition, the changing levels of interest rates may have an impact on loan demand, demand for various deposit products, credit losses, and other elements of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts and correspondent bank service charges.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions. These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall loan loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, the amount of non-indemnified purchased loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. A portion of the allowance is individually allocated to impaired loans whose full collectability of principal is uncertain. Such allocations are determined by Management based on loan-by-loan analyses. The Company evaluates for impairment all loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of $500 thousand which are classified or on nonaccrual status and all troubled debt restructured\u201d loans. The remainder of the loan portfolio is collectively evaluated for impairment based in part on quantitative analyses of historical loan loss experience of loan portfolio segments to determine standard loss rates for each segment. The loss rate for each loan portfolio segment reflects both the historical loss experience during a look-back period and the loss emergence period. The loss rates are applied to segmented loan balances to allocate the allowance to the segments of the loan portfolio.\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, </td>

price can impact the Company's financial results in several ways. First, the Company has regularly repurchased and retired its common stock; the market price paid to retire the Company's common stock affects the level of the Company's shareholders' equity, cash flows and shares outstanding. Second, the Company's common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share. Third, fluctuations in the Company's common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase Company common stock through the exercise of such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding. Finally, the amount of compensation expense associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the Company's common stock price.\n\nManagement has increased the investment securities portfolio in response to deposit growth and loan volume declines.

Loan demand from credit worthy borrowers will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions. The Company aggressively solicits non-interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposits, which are the least sensitive to changes in interest rates. The growth of these deposit balances is subject to heightened competition, the success of the Company's sales efforts, delivery of superior customer service, new regulations and market conditions. The Company does not aggressively solicit higher-costing time deposits; as a result, Management anticipates such deposits will decline. Changes in interest rates, most notably rising interest rates, could impact deposit volumes. Depending on economic conditions, interest rate levels, liquidity management and a variety of other conditions, deposit growth may be used to fund loans or purchase investment securities. However, due to possible volatility in economic conditions, competition and political uncertainty, loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain. Shareholder dividends are expected to continue subject to the Board's discretion and continuing evaluation of capital levels, earnings, asset quality and other factors.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>To Be </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Required for </td> <td> </td> <td>Well-capitalized </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capital Adequacy Purposes </td> <td> </td> <td>Under Prompt </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>At December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective </td> <td> </td> <td>Effective </td> <td> </td> <td>Corrective Action </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Company </td> <td> </td> <td>Bank </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>January 1, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Regulations (Bank) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common Equity Tier I Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.125 </td> <td>%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>%(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier I Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.85 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.625 </td> <td>%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.50 </td> <td>%(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Capital </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.625 </td> <td>%(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.50 </td> <td>%(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leverage Ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.000 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company and the Bank routinely project capital levels by analyzing forecasted earnings, credit quality, securities valuations, shareholder dividends, asset volumes, share repurchase activity, stock option exercise proceeds, and other factors.

portfolio as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity risk can result from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows, or from disruptions in the financial markets. The Company performs liquidity stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its liquidity. Under the stress testing, the Company assumes outflows of funds increase beyond expected levels. Measurement of such heightened outflows considers the composition of the Company's deposit base, including any concentration of deposits, non-deposit funding such as short-term borrowings, and unfunded lending commitments. The Company evaluates its stock of highly liquid assets to meet the assumed higher levels of outflows. Highly liquid assets include cash and amounts due from other banks from daily transaction settlements, reduced by branch cash needs and Federal Reserve Bank reserve requirements, and investment securities based on regulatory risk-weighting guidelines. Based on the results of the most recent liquidity stress test, Management is satisfied with the liquidity condition of the Bank and the Company. However, no assurance can be given the Bank or Company will not experience a period of reduced liquidity.\nLiquidity and Funding\n\nIn 2016, noninterest expense decreased $3.5 million or 3.4% compared with 2015. Expenses for other real estate owned in 2016 were reduced by net gains from the sale of foreclosed properties. Occupancy expense decreased $844 thousand in 2016 compared with 2015 mostly due to branch closures and a lease expiration related to a non-branch building. Salaries and related benefits decreased $685 thousand primarily due to employee attrition, offset in part by higher expenses for stock based compensation. Courier expense decreased $377 thousand primarily due to logistical changes and switching to new vendors. Amortization of identifiable intangibles decreased $352 thousand as assets are amortized on a declining balance method. Other operating expense decreased $2.3 million primarily due to lower expenses for correspondent service fees (down $1.3 million), FDIC insurance assessments (down $535 thousand) and operating losses on limited partnership investments (down $375 thousand). Two categories of expense offset the decrease: Professional fees increased $1.5 million due to higher legal fees associated with loan administration and collection activities. Furniture and equipment expense increased $467 thousand mainly due to increased depreciation costs for technology.\nThe Company maintains an investment securities portfolio consisting of securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities, agency and non-agency mortgage backed securities, state and political subdivisions, corporations, and asset-backed and other securities. Investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses and recorded investment in loans were evaluated for impairment as follows:\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the investment securities.\n -29- \n\n\nManagement believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio is reasonably stable; however, classified and nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period. The performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment, economic conditions, and collateral values or factors particular to the borrower. No assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual and delinquent loans will not occur in the future.\n\nThe following tables set forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average assets and liability balances (volume) and changes in average interest yields/rates for the periods indicated. Changes not solely attributable to volume or yields/rates have been allocated in proportion to the respective volume and yield/rate components.\nThe Company extends loans to commercial and consumer customers which expose the Company to the risk borrowers will default, causing loan losses. The Company's lending activities are exposed to various qualitative risks. All loan segments are exposed to risks inherent in the economy and market conditions. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial loan segment include the borrowers' business performance and financial condition, and the value of collateral for secured loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial real estate segment include the borrowers' business performance and the value of properties collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the construction loan segment include the borrowers' performance in successfully developing the real estate into the intended purpose and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the residential real estate segment include the borrowers' financial wherewithal to service the mortgages and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the consumer loan segment include the financial condition of the borrowers and the value of collateral securing the loans.\nThe Company's strategy includes building the value of its deposit base by building balances of lower-costing deposits and avoiding reliance on higher-costing time deposits. From 2014 to 2016 higher costing time deposits declined from 10% to 6% of total deposits. The Company's average balances of checking and savings accounts represented 94% of average balances of total deposits in 2016 compared with 93% in 2015 and 90% in 2014.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nIn 2015, noninterest expense decreased $1.5 million or 1.4% compared with 2014 primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and other operational expenses. Salaries and related benefits decreased $2.6 million primarily due to employee attrition. Amortization of identifiable intangibles decreased as assets are amortized on a declining balance method. Courier expense decreased primarily due to consolidating service runs. OREO expense in 2015 included net writedowns while in 2014 the Company realized net gains on disposition of foreclosed assets. Furniture and equipment expense increased primarily due to higher depreciation costs resulting from computer and software upgrades and higher software license fees.\nThe Company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and follows a strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk. The Bank's organization structure separates the functions of business development and loan underwriting; Management believes this segregation of duties avoids inherent conflicts of combining business development and loan approval functions. In measuring and managing credit risk, the Company adheres to the following practices.\n (3) Net interest margin is computed by calculating the difference between interest income and expense, divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin is greater than the net interest spread due to the benefit of noninterest-bearing demand deposits. \n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the loan portfolio, loan portfolio credit risk, and allowance for loan losses.\n\n(3) Includes 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nThe Company has been replacing higher-cost funding sources with low-cost deposits and interest expense has declined to offset some of the decline in interest income. Interest expense has been reduced by lowering rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings and by reducing the volume of higher-cost funding sources. A $10 million term repurchase agreement was repaid in August 2014 and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances were repaid in January 2015. Average balances of time deposits declined $62 million in 2016 compared with 2015 while lower-cost checking and savings deposits grew 5% in the same period. Lower-cost checking and savings deposits accounted for 94.1% of total average deposits in 2016 compared with 92.5% in 2015 and 89.8% in 2014.\nThe Company performs capital stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its capital. Under the stress testing, the Company assumes various scenarios such as deteriorating economic and operating conditions, unanticipated asset devaluations, and significant operational lapses. The Company measures the impact of these scenarios on its earnings and capital. Based on the results of the most recent stress tests, Management is satisfied with the capital condition of the Bank and the Company. However, no assurance can be given the Bank or Company will not experience a period of reduced earnings or a reduction in capital from unanticipated events and circumstances.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe final rule did not supersede provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requiring federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action (PCA) to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The final rule revised the PCA thresholds to incorporate the higher minimum levels of capital, including the common equity tier 1\u201d ratio.\nThe Company reported net income of $58.9 million or $2.29 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with net income of $58.8 million or $2.30 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015 and net income of $60.6 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires the Company to make certain estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company's investment securities portfolios included securities issued by 698 state and local government municipalities and agencies located within 44 states with a fair value of $848.2 million. None of the Company's investment securities were issued by Puerto Rican government entities. The largest exposure to any one municipality or agency was $10.0 million (fair value) represented by nine general obligation bonds.\n(2) Federal National Mortgage Association\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n (3) Net interest margin is computed by calculating the difference between interest income and expense, divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin is greater than the net interest spread due to the benefit of noninterest-bearing demand deposits. \nConsumer installment and other loans are predominantly comprised of indirect automobile loans with underwriting based on credit history and scores, personal income, debt service capacity, and collateral values.\nCommitments and Letters of Credit\n \u00b7 The Bank maintains two loan administration offices whose sole responsibility is to manage and collect classified loans. \n -19- \nPurchased loans were recorded on the date of purchase at estimated fair value; fair value discounts include a component for estimated loan losses. The Company evaluates all nonaccrual purchased loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of $500 thousand for impairment; the impaired loan value is compared to the recorded investment in the loan, which has been reduced by the loan default discount estimated on the date of purchase. If Management's impairment analysis determines the impaired loan value is less than the recorded investment in the purchased loan, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for the deficiency. For all other purchased loan portfolio segments, Management applies loss rates to the purchased loan portfolio segments to determine initial allocations of the allowance. Further, liquidating purchased consumer installment loans are evaluated separately by applying historical loss rates to forecasted liquidating principal balances to initially measure losses inherent in this portfolio segment. The initial allocations of the allowance to purchased loan portfolio segments are compared to loan default discounts ascribed to each segment. Management establishes allocations of the allowance for loan losses for any estimated deficiency.\nFurther detail of federal funds purchased and other borrowed funds is as follows:\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe following sets forth, by time remaining to maturity, the Company's domestic time deposits in amounts of $100 thousand or more:\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nDeposit Categories\nComparing 2016 with 2015, net interest and loan fee income (FTE) decreased $3.2 million due to lower average balances of loans (down $194 million), partially offset by higher average balances of investments (up $255 million) and lower average balances of higher-costing time deposits (down $62 million).\nLoan volumes have declined due to problem loan workout activities (such as chargeoffs, collateral repossessions and principal payments), particularly with purchased loans, and reduced volumes of loan originations. In Management's opinion, current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential. As a result, the Company has not currently taken an aggressive posture relative to loan portfolio growth. Management has increased investment securities as loan volumes have declined. The average balance of the investment securities portfolio increased from $2.4 billion in 2014 to $2.8 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2016. The Company, in anticipation of rising interest rates, has been purchasing floating rate and shorter-duration investment securities with lower yields than longer-duration securities to increase liquidity. The Company's high levels of liquidity will provide an opportunity to obtain higher yielding assets assuming market interest rates start rising.\nThe Company's primary capital resource is shareholders' equity, which was $561 million at December 31, 2016 compared with $532 million at December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of equity to total assets was 10.46% at December 31, 2016 and 10.30% at December 31, 2015.\n -36- \nComparing 2016 with 2015, net income increased $100 thousand due to a reversal of provision for loan losses and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest and fee income (FTE), lower noninterest income and higher income tax provision (FTE). The lower net interest and fee income (FTE) was primarily caused by lower average balances of loans, partially offset by higher average balances of investments and lower average balances of higher-costing time deposits. The Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million, reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to reduced levels of service charges on deposit accounts, financial services commissions and other service fees, partially offset by higher debit card fees. Noninterest expense decreased mostly due to lower personnel expense, lower occupancy expense, and lower other operating expense, offset in part by higher legal fees. Income tax provision (FTE) increased in 2016 due to higher pretax income, declining tax preference items and lower tax credits.\nProvision for Income Tax\n \u00b7 Increased the risk-weighting of certain assets, and \nHeld to Maturity Portfolio Maturity Distribution\n -24- \nIn 2016, noninterest income decreased $1.4 million or 2.7% compared with 2015. Service charges on deposits decreased $1.4 million due to declines in fees charged on overdrawn and insufficient funds accounts (down $1.1 million) and lower fees on analyzed accounts (down $393 thousand), partially offset by the effect of deposit fee increases effective February 2016. The decrease was partially offset by increased debit card fees of $206 thousand as a result of increased transaction volumes.\nThe Company primarily attracts deposits from local businesses and professionals, as well as through retail savings and checking accounts, and, to a more limited extent, certificates of deposit.\nAvailable for Sale Portfolio\n -22- \n(2) Includes 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nMarket Risk - Equity Markets\nCommercial real estate loans represent term loans used to acquire real estate to be operated by the borrower in a commercial capacity. Underwriting practices evaluate each borrower's global cash flow as the principal source of loan repayment, independent appraisal of value of the property, and other relevant factors. Commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first lien on the property as a secondary source of repayment.\n -21- \nThe Company has historically generated high levels of earnings, which provide a means of accumulating capital. The Company's net income as a percentage of average shareholders' equity ( return on equity\u201d or ROE\u201d) has been 10.9% in 2016, 11.3% in 2015 and 11.6% in 2014. The Company also raises capital as employees exercise stock options. Capital raised through the exercise of stock options was $24 million in 2016 compared with $5 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014.\n -34- \nThe Company's asset and liability position was neutral\u201d to slightly asset sensitive\u201d at December 31, 2016, depending on the interest rate assumptions applied to the simulation model employed by Management to measure interest rate risk. An asset sensitive\u201d position results in a slightly larger change in interest income than in interest expense resulting from application of assumed interest rate changes. Simulation estimates depend on, and will change with, the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation. Management continues to monitor the interest rate environment as well as economic conditions and other factors it deems relevant in managing the Company's exposure to interest rate risk.\n -32- \nThe Company's primary source of revenue is net interest income, or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, substantially all of the Company's investment securities continue to be investment grade rated by one or more major rating agencies. In addition to monitoring credit rating agency evaluations, Management performs its own evaluations regarding the credit worthiness of the issuer or the securitized assets underlying asset-backed securities. The Company's procedures for evaluating investments in securities are in accordance with guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Investing in Securities without Reliance on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Agencies\u201d (SR 12-15) and other regulatory guidance. Credit ratings are considered in our analysis only as a guide to the historical default rate associated with similarly-rated bonds. There have been no significant differences in our internal analyses compared with the ratings assigned by the third party credit rating agencies.\nNet Income\nAt December 31, 2016, the revenue bonds in the Company's investment securities portfolios were issued by state and local government municipalities and agencies to fund public services such as water utility, sewer utility, recreational and school facilities, and general public and economic improvements. The revenue bonds were payable from 23 revenue sources. The revenue sources that represent 5% or more individually of the total revenue bonds are summarized in the following table.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nIn adjusting the Company's asset/liability position, Management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin and net interest income. At times, depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates, the relationship between long and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, Management may adjust the Company's interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income. The Company's results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short-term interest rates.\n\n (2) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. \nThe decline in the unallocated allowance for loan losses during 2016 was generally due to the overall improved economic conditions and credit quality metrics.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's average daily amount of deposits and the rates paid for the periods indicated:\n\n -27- \n \u00b7 Introduced a capital conservation buffer,\u201d \n\nThe Bank's dividends paid to the Parent Company and proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided adequate cash flow for the Parent Company to pay shareholder dividends of $40 million in 2016, $39 million in 2015 and $40 million in 2014, and retire common stock in the amount of $6 million, $15 million and $53 million, respectively. Payment of dividends to the Parent Company by the Bank is limited under California and Federal laws. The Company believes these regulatory dividend restrictions will not have an impact on the Parent Company's ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nCommercial loans represent term loans used to acquire durable business assets or revolving lines of credit used to finance working capital. Underwriting practices evaluate each borrower's cash flow as the principal source of loan repayment. Commercial loans are generally secured by the borrower's business assets as a secondary source of repayment. Commercial loans are evaluated for credit-worthiness based on prior loan performance, borrower financial information including cash flow, borrower net worth and aggregate debt.\n\nThe following tables summarize the total general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states and political subdivisions held in the Company's investment securities portfolios as of the dates indicated, identifying the state in which the issuing government municipality or agency operates.\n -42- \nManagement continually evaluates the Company's investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, liquidity, and the level of interest rate risk to which the Company is exposed. These evaluations may cause Management to change the level of funds the Company deploys into investment securities and change the composition of the Company's investment securities portfolio. In 2016 Management reduced securities of U.S. Government sponsored entities to reduce call optionality and increased agency residential MBS to develop more reliable cash flows.\nDeposit Distribution and Average Rates Paid\n\nComponents of Net Income\n (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. \nFinancial Ratios\nThe following table sets forth the short-term borrowings of the Company:\nTime Deposits $100,000 or more Maturity Distribution\n -20- \n(1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate.\nThe Company's earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board (the FRB\u201d). The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable.\nComparing 2015 with 2014, net interest and fee income (FTE) decreased $4.4 million or 2.9% primarily due to a lower average volume of loans (down $155 million) and lower yields on interest-earning assets (FTE) (down 37 basis points bp\u201d), partially offset by higher average balances of investments (up $436 million) and lower average balances of higher-costing interest-bearing liabilities.\nBanking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches rule\u201d began complying with the final rule on January 1, 2015; on such date, the Company and the Bank became subject to the revised definitions of regulatory capital, the new minimum regulatory capital ratios, and various regulatory capital adjustments and deductions according to transition provisions and timelines. All banking organizations began calculating standardized total risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2015. The transition period for the capital conservation buffer for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016 and will end January 1, 2019. Any bank subject to the rule which is unable to maintain its capital conservation buffer\u201d will be restricted in the payment of discretionary executive compensation and shareholder distributions, such as dividends and share repurchases.\n(1) Includes 0.625% capital conservation buffer.\n (2) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. \nContractual Obligations\n -44- \nSummary of Changes in Interest Income and Expense\n\nAsset/Liability and Market Risk Management\n\n \u00b7 Established limits on the amount of deferred tax assets with any excess treated as a deduction from Tier 1 capital. \n\nThe Company issues formal commitments on lines of credit to well-established and financially responsible commercial enterprises. Such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs. Occasionally, such commitments are in the form of letters of credit to facilitate the customers' particular business transactions. Commitment fees are generally charged for commitments and letters of credit. Commitments on lines of credit and letters of credit typically mature within one year. For further information, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe income tax provision (FTE) was $34.2 million in 2016 compared with $32.1 million in 2015 and $34.2 million in 2014. The 2016 effective tax rate (FTE) was 36.8% compared with 35.3% in 2015 and 36.1% in 2014. The effective tax rates without FTE adjustments were 26.4% for 2016 and 23.4% for 2015 and 23.2% for 2014. The effective tax rates for 2016 were higher than the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 due to higher pre-tax income and declining tax preference items. Interest income earned on municipal securities and tax free loans which are exempt from federal income taxes have declined in 2016. The tax credits earned from investments in limited partnerships have also declined in 2016.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, Management has identified the allowance for loan losses accounting to be the accounting area requiring the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. A discussion of the factors affecting accounting for the allowance for loan losses and purchased loans is included in the Loan Portfolio Credit Risk\u201d discussion below.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nComparing 2015 with 2014, net income decreased $1.9 million or 3.1%, primarily due to lower net interest and loan fee income (FTE) and lower noninterest income, partially offset by decreases in loan loss provision, noninterest expense and income tax provision (FTE). The lower net interest and loan fee income (FTE) was primarily caused by a lower average volume of loans and lower yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher average balances of investments and lower average balances of higher-costing interest-bearing liabilities. The provision for loan losses was reduced, reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio; net loan losses and nonperforming loan volumes have declined relative to earlier periods. Lower noninterest income was mostly attributable to lower merchant processing service fees and lower service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to reduced personnel costs and other operational expenses.\nThe following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity, the amounts of interest income earned from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields, and the amounts of interest expense incurred on average interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting rates. Average loan balances include nonperforming loans. Interest income includes reversal of previously accrued interest on loans placed on non-accrual status during the period and proceeds from loans on nonaccrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income and accretion of purchased loan discounts. Yields on tax-exempt securities and loans have been adjusted upward to reflect the effect of income exempt from federal income taxation at the current statutory tax rate.\nComponents of Noninterest Income\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company's investment securities portfolios included securities issued by 725 state and local government municipalities and agencies located within 44 states with a fair value of $864.2 million. None of the Company's investment securities were issued by Puerto Rican government entities. The largest exposure to any one municipality or agency was $10.3 million (fair value) represented by nine general obligation bonds.\nThe following table sets forth the relative maturities and contractual yields of the Company's held to maturity securities at December 31, 2016. Yields on state and political subdivision securities have been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current federal statutory rate. Mortgage-backed securities are shown separately because they are typically paid in monthly installments over a number of years.\t\n -45- \nComponents of Net Interest and Loan Fee Income (FTE)\n\nNonperforming Assets\nNet Interest and Loan Fee Income (FTE)\n -28- \nThe following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio of the Company by type of loan and type of borrower, on the dates indicated:\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nOperating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $2 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases. Operating lease obligations may be retired prior to the contractual maturity as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The purchase obligation consists of the Company's minimum liabilities under contracts with third-party automation services providers.\nThe former County Bank loans and repossessed loan collateral were purchased from the FDIC with indemnifying loss-sharing agreements. The loss-sharing agreement on single-family residential real estate assets expires February 6, 2019. The loss-sharing agreement on non-single-family residential real estate assets expired February 6, 2014 as to losses and expired February 6, 2017 as to loss recoveries.\nAsset/liability management involves the evaluation, monitoring and management of interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. The fundamental objective of the Company's management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk.\n (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. \n -31- \n\nIn 2015, noninterest income decreased $3.9 million or 7.6% compared with 2014. Service charges on deposits decreased $2.0 million compared with 2014 due to declines in fees charged on overdrawn and insufficient funds accounts (down $913 thousand), lower fees on analyzed accounts (down $661 thousand) and lower activity on checking accounts (down $325 thousand). Merchant processing services declined $880 thousand primarily due to lower transaction volumes.\n\nThe objective of liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund the Company's operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The Company achieves this objective through the selection of asset and liability maturity mixes that it believes best meet its needs. The Company's liquidity position is enhanced by its ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets.\n \u00b7 The Bank maintains a Loan Review Department which reports directly to the Board of Directors. The Loan Review Department performs independent evaluations of loans and assigns credit risk grades to evaluated loans using grading standards employed by bank regulatory agencies. Those loans judged to carry higher risk attributes are referred to as classified loans.\u201d Classified loans receive elevated management attention to maximize collection. \n \u00b7 Established higher minimum levels of capital, \nThe remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated. The unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance. The unallocated allowance addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with Management's analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio, which are related to the risks of the Company's general lending activity. Included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have not yet been recognized in loan chargeoff history (external factors). The primary external factor evaluated by the Company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by Management as of December 31, 2016 is economic and business conditions $0.7 million. Also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the Company's loan portfolio and credit administration (internal factors). The internal factors evaluated by the Company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by Management are: loan review system $1.4 million, adequacy of lending Management and staff $1.1 million and concentrations of credit $1.3 million.\nSummary of Changes in Interest Income and Expense due to Changes in Average Asset & Liability Balances and Yields Earned & Rates Paid\nCapital to Risk-Adjusted Assets\n\n\n -39- \nMarket values of loan collateral can directly impact the level of loan chargeoffs and the provision for loan losses. The financial condition and liquidity of debtors issuing bonds and debtors whose mortgages or other obligations are securitized can directly impact the credit quality of the Company's investment securities portfolio requiring the Company to recognize other than temporary impairment charges. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk, are not significant in the normal course of the Company's business activities.\nIn recent years, the Company's deposit base has provided the majority of the Company's funding requirements. This relatively stable and low-cost source of funds, along with shareholders' equity, provided 98 percent of funding for average total assets in 2016 and 97 percent in 2015. The stability of the Company's funding from customer deposits is in part reliant on the confidence clients have in the Company. The Company places a very high priority in maintaining this confidence through conservative credit and capital management practices and by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity reserves.\nHeld to Maturity Portfolio\nThe Company originates loans with the intent to hold such assets until principal is repaid. Management follows written loan underwriting policies and procedures which are approved by the Bank's Board of Directors. Loans are underwritten following approved underwriting standards and lending authorities within a formalized organizational structure. The Board of Directors also approves independent real estate appraisers to be used in obtaining estimated values for real property serving as loan collateral. Prevailing economic trends and conditions are also taken into consideration in loan underwriting practices.\n \u00b7 Introduced a new Common Equity Tier 1\u201d capital measurement, \n -30- \nThe following table shows the fair value carrying amount of the Company's investment securities available for sale as of the dates indicated:\n -40- \nThe following table summarizes the allowance for loan losses, chargeoffs and recoveries of the Company for the periods indicated:\nMarket Risk - Other\n\nLoan Portfolio\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million in 2016. The Company provided no provision for loan losses in 2015 compared with $2.8 million in 2014. During 2016, classified loans declined $17.1 million (which included nonperforming loans of $8.9 million). The Company's net losses of prior loan losses decreased from $3.0 million in 2014 and $1.7 million in 2015 to $617 thousand in 2016; these developments were reflected in Management's evaluation of credit quality, the level of the provision for loan losses, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016. Management's evaluation of credit quality includes originated and purchased loans. The Company recorded purchased loans at estimated fair value upon the acquisition dates. Such estimated fair values were recognized for individual loans, although small balance homogenous loans were pooled for valuation purposes. The valuation discounts recorded for purchased loans included Management's assessment of the risk of principal loss under economic and borrower conditions prevailing on the dates of purchase. The purchased County Bank loans secured by single-family residential real estate are covered\u201d through February 6, 2019 by loss-sharing agreements the Company entered with the FDIC which mitigates losses during the term of the agreements. Any deterioration in estimated value related to principal loss subsequent to the acquisition dates requires additional loss recognition through a provision for loan losses. No assurance can be given future provisions for loan losses related to purchased loans will not be necessary. For further information regarding credit risk, the FDIC loss-sharing agreements, net credit losses and the allowance for loan losses, see the Loan Portfolio Credit Risk\u201d and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d sections of this Report.\n (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. \nTotal time deposits were $256 million and $287 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The following table sets forth, by time remaining to maturity, the Company's total domestic time deposits. The Company has no foreign time deposits.\nAll loan applications must be for clearly defined legitimate purposes with a determinable primary source of repayment, and as appropriate, secondary sources of repayment. All loans are supported by appropriate documentation such as current financial statements, tax returns, credit reports, collateral information, guarantor asset verification, title reports, appraisals, and other relevant documentation.\nThe following table shows key financial ratios for the periods indicated:\nThe following table shows the maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity of commercial, commercial real estate, and construction loans at December 31, 2016. Balances exclude residential real estate loans and consumer loans totaling $453.3 million. These types of loans are typically paid in monthly installments over a number of years.\nThe Company manages credit costs by consistently enforcing conservative underwriting and administration procedures and aggressively pursuing collection efforts with debtors experiencing financial difficulties. The provision for loan losses reflects Management's assessment of credit risk in the loan portfolio during each of the periods presented.\nThe Company paid common dividends totaling $40 million in 2016, $39 million in 2015 and $40 million in 2014, which represent dividends per common share of $1.56, $1.53 and $1.52, respectively. The Company's earnings have historically exceeded dividends paid to shareholders. The amount of earnings in excess of dividends provides the Company resources to finance growth and maintain appropriate levels of shareholders' equity. In the absence of profitable growth opportunities, the Company has repurchased and retired its common stock as another means to return earnings to shareholders. The Company repurchased and retired 137 thousand shares valued at $6 million in 2016, 344 thousand shares valued at $15 million in 2015 and 1.0 million shares valued at $53 million in 2014.\nNoninterest Income\n\nEquity price risk can affect the Company. As an example, any preferred or common stock holdings, as permitted by banking regulations, can fluctuate in value. Management regularly assesses the extent and duration of any declines in market value, the causes of such declines, the likelihood of a recovery in market value, and its intent to hold securities until a recovery in value occurs. Declines in value of preferred or common stock holdings that are deemed other than temporary\u201d could result in loss recognition in the Company's income statement.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity and Yields, Rates & Interest Margin\nFor management purposes, the Company segregates its loan portfolio into three segments. Loans originated by the Company following its loan underwriting policies and procedures are separated from loans purchased from the FDIC. Loan volumes have declined due to problem loan workout activities, particularly with purchased loans, and reduced volumes of loan originations. In Management's opinion, current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential. As a result, the Company has not currently taken an aggressive posture relative to loan portfolio growth.\nYields on interest-earning assets declined due to historically low interest rates prevailing in the market. The net interest margin (FTE) was 3.24% in 2016, 3.36% in 2015 and 3.70% in 2014. The volume of older-dated higher-yielding loans and securities declined due to principal maturities and paydowns. Newly originated loans have lower yields. As the investment securities portfolio grew during the three years ended December 31, 2016, the investment securities portfolio generated an increasing portion of the interest income (FTE). Interest income (FTE) generated from investments represented 41.8% of total interest income (FTE) in 2014, 47.0% in 2015 and 52.2% in 2016. During the three years ended December 31, 2016, the net interest margin (FTE) was affected by low market interest rates and the changing composition of interest-earning assets.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses represents Management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. In evaluating credit risk for loans, Management measures loss potential of the carrying value of loans. As described above, payments received on nonaccrual loans may be applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected. Further, the carrying value of purchased loans includes fair value discounts assigned at the time of purchase under the provisions of FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, and FASB ASC 310-30, Loans or Debt Securities with Deteriorated Credit Quality. The allowance for loan losses represents Management's estimate of loan losses in excess of these reductions to the carrying value of loans within the loan portfolio.\nComponents of Noninterest Expense\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule that implements changes to the regulatory capital framework for all banking organizations. The rule's provisions which most affected the regulatory capital requirements of the Company and the Bank:\nLoan Portfolio\n\n\n\n -41- \n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires Management to estimate the amount of losses inherent in the loan portfolio and establish an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established by assessing a provision for loan losses against the Company's earnings. In estimating credit losses, Management must exercise judgment in evaluating information deemed relevant, such as financial information regarding individual borrowers, overall credit loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other information. The amount of ultimate losses on the loan portfolio can vary from the estimated amounts. Management follows a systematic methodology to estimate loss potential in an effort to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses.\n(1) The rates for total deposits reflect value of noninterest-bearing deposits.\n -23- ", "item_7_text": "The following table sets forth the known contractual obligations, except short-term borrowing arrangements and post-retirement benefit plans, of the Company:\nThe following table presents the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of December 31 for the years indicated:\nResidential real estate loans generally represent first lien mortgages used by the borrower to purchase or refinance a principal residence. For interest-rate risk purposes, the Company offers only fully-amortizing, adjustable-rate mortgages. In underwriting first lien mortgages, the Company evaluates each borrower's ability to repay the loan, an independent appraisal of the value of the property, and other relevant factors. The Company does not offer riskier mortgage products, such as non-amortizing interest-only\u201d mortgages and negative amortization\u201d mortgages.\n -43- \n -25- \n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n -26- \n (2) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. \n(1) Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation\nLoan Portfolio Credit Risk\n\nShort-term Borrowings\n\nThe Company's principal source of revenue is net interest income, which represents interest earned on loans and investment securities ( earning assets\u201d) reduced by interest paid on deposits and other borrowings ( interest-bearing liabilities\u201d). The relatively low level of market interest rates during the five years ended December 31, 2016 has reduced the spread between interest rates on earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The Company's net interest margin and net interest income declined as market interest rates on newly originated loans remain below the yields earned on older-dated loans and on the overall loan portfolio.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nShort-Term Borrowings Distribution\nCapital Resources\n (3) Net interest margin is computed by calculating the difference between interest income and expense, divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin is greater than the net interest spread due to the benefit of noninterest-bearing demand deposits. \nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity and Yields, Rates & Interest Margin\nUnder the final rule, a banking organization that is not subject to the advanced approaches rule\u201d may make a one-time election not to include most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income, including net-of-tax unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities, in regulatory capital. Neither the Company nor the Bank is subject to the advanced approaches rule\u201d and both made the election not to include most elements of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in regulatory capital.\nSummary of Average Balances, Yields/Rates and Interest Differential\nThe Company does not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk, even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the Company's Board of Directors.\nThe following discussion addresses information pertaining to the financial condition and results of operations of Westamerica Bancorporation and subsidiaries (the Company\u201d) that may not be otherwise apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. It should be read in conjunction with those statements and notes found on pages 48 through 88, as well as with the other information presented throughout this Report.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n\nAvailable for Sale Portfolio Maturity Distribution\nClassified loans with higher levels of credit risk are further designated as nonaccrual loans.\u201d Management places classified loans on nonaccrual status when full collection of contractual interest and principal payments is in doubt. Uncollected interest previously accrued on loans placed on nonaccrual status is reversed as a charge against interest income. The Company does not accrue interest income on loans following placement on nonaccrual status. Interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied to reduce the carrying amount of the loan unless the carrying amount is well secured by loan collateral. Nonperforming assets\u201d include nonaccrual loans, loans 90 or more days past due and still accruing, and repossessed loan collateral (commonly referred to as Other Real Estate Owned\u201d).\nFor loans secured by real estate, the Bank requires title insurance to insure the status of its lien and each borrower is obligated to insure the real estate collateral, naming the Company as loss payee, in an amount sufficient to repay the principal amount outstanding in the event of a property casualty loss.\n\n -38- \nLiquidity is further provided by assets such as balances held at the Federal Reserve Bank, investment securities, and amortizing loans. The Company's investment securities portfolio provides a substantial secondary liquidity reserve. The Company held $3.2 billion in total investment securities at December 31, 2016. Under certain deposit, borrowing and other arrangements, the Company must hold and pledge investment securities as collateral. At December 31, 2016, such collateral requirements totaled approximately $769 million.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe Company's loan portfolio has declined from 2012 through 2016; Management has been avoiding long-dated, low-yielding loans given historically low interest rates. Management has also maintained, in their opinion, conservative loan underwriting, terms and conditions. During this period, the investment securities portfolio has grown. The Company has been reducing its exposure to rising interest rates by purchasing shorter-duration investment securities, which have lower yields than longer-duration securities. The changing composition of interest earning assets and low market interest rates has pressured the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent ( FTE\u201d) basis. In 2016 the Company's average checking and savings deposits were 5 percent higher than in 2015. These lower-costing deposit products, which earn relatively low interest rates and are less volatile than time deposits during periods of rising market interest rates, represented 94 percent of average total deposits in 2016. Credit quality improved with nonperforming assets declining to $12.0 million at December 31, 2016 from $24.6 million at December 31, 2015. Reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio, including improvements in most credit metrics the Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million in 2016. Management is focused on controlling all noninterest expense levels, particularly due to market interest rate pressure on net interest income. Noninterest expenses declined to $101.8 million in 2016 compared to $105.3 million in 2015.\nLoan Maturity Distribution\nReal estate construction loans represent the financing of real estate development. Loan principal disbursements are controlled through the use of project budgets, and disbursements are approved based on construction progress, which is validated by project site inspections. A first lien on the real estate serves as collateral to secure the loan.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity and Yields, Rates & Interest Margin\nNoninterest Expense\nTime Deposits Maturity Distribution\nThe 2016 decline in the portion of the allowance for loan losses ascribed to originated loan segments was due to declines in classified loans, delinquent loans, and the overall loan portfolio. The decline in the unallocated portion was due to improved economic conditions within the Company's geographic markets.\n (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. \nInterest Rate Risk\nSummary of Changes in Interest Income and Expense\nNonperforming assets have declined during 2016 due to payoffs and chargeoffs. At December 31, 2016, one loan secured by commercial real estate with a balance of $4.4 million was on nonaccrual status. The remaining thirteen nonaccrual loans held at December 31, 2016 had an average carrying value of $306 thousand and the largest carrying value was $1.3 million.\n\nThe Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on an FTE basis using the current statutory federal tax rate, which is a non-generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) financial measure. Management believes the FTE basis is valuable to the reader because the Company's loan and investment securities portfolios contain a relatively large portion of municipal loans and securities that generate interest income which is exempt from federal income tax. The Company's tax exempt loans and securities composition may not be similar to that of other banks; therefore in order to reflect the impact of the federally tax exempt loans and securities on the net interest margin and net interest income for comparability with other banks, the Company presents its net interest margin and net interest income on an FTE basis.\nThe capital ratios for the Company and the Bank under the new capital framework are presented in the table below, on the dates indicated.\nInterest rate risk is a significant market risk affecting the Company. Many factors affect the Company's exposure to interest rates, such as general economic and financial conditions, customer preferences, historical pricing relationships, and re-pricing characteristics of financial instruments. Assets and liabilities may mature or re-price at different times. Assets and liabilities may re-price at the same time but by different amounts. Short-term and long-term market interest rates may change by different amounts. The timing and amount of cash flows of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as interest rates change. In addition, the changing levels of interest rates may have an impact on loan demand, demand for various deposit products, credit losses, and other elements of earnings such as account analysis fees on commercial deposit accounts and correspondent bank service charges.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered appropriate to provide for losses that can be estimated based upon specific and general conditions. These include conditions unique to individual borrowers, as well as overall loan loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, the amount of non-indemnified purchased loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. A portion of the allowance is individually allocated to impaired loans whose full collectability of principal is uncertain. Such allocations are determined by Management based on loan-by-loan analyses. The Company evaluates for impairment all loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of $500 thousand which are classified or on nonaccrual status and all troubled debt restructured\u201d loans. The remainder of the loan portfolio is collectively evaluated for impairment based in part on quantitative analyses of historical loan loss experience of loan portfolio segments to determine standard loss rates for each segment. The loss rate for each loan portfolio segment reflects both the historical loss experience during a look-back period and the loss emergence period. The loss rates are applied to segmented loan balances to allocate the allowance to the segments of the loan portfolio.\n\nFluctuations in the Company's common stock price can impact the Company's financial results in several ways. First, the Company has regularly repurchased and retired its common stock; the market price paid to retire the Company's common stock affects the level of the Company's shareholders' equity, cash flows and shares outstanding. Second, the Company's common stock price impacts the number of dilutive equivalent shares used to compute diluted earnings per share. Third, fluctuations in the Company's common stock price can motivate holders of options to purchase Company common stock through the exercise of such options thereby increasing the number of shares outstanding. Finally, the amount of compensation expense associated with share based compensation fluctuates with changes in and the volatility of the Company's common stock price.\n\nManagement has increased the investment securities portfolio in response to deposit growth and loan volume declines. The carrying value of the Company's investment securities portfolio was $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2016, an increase of $351 million compared to December 31, 2015.\nWestamerica Bancorporation (\"Parent Company\") is a separate entity apart from Westamerica Bank ( Bank\u201d) and must provide for its own liquidity. In addition to its operating expenses, the Parent Company is responsible for the payment of dividends declared for its shareholders, and interest and principal on any outstanding debt. Substantially all of the Parent Company's revenues are obtained from subsidiary dividends and service fees.\n -33- \n\nManagement expects a high level of uncertainty in regard to interest rate levels in the immediate term, and Management's most likely earnings forecast for the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 assumes market interest rates will gradually rise, with short-term rates rising more than long-term rates.\nThe following table shows the amortized cost carrying amount and fair value of the Company's investment securities held to maturity as of the dates indicated:\n -37- \nThe following summarizes activity in the allowance for loan losses:\nManagement will monitor the Company's cash levels throughout 2017. Loan demand from credit worthy borrowers will be dictated by economic and competitive conditions. The Company aggressively solicits non-interest bearing demand deposits and money market checking deposits, which are the least sensitive to changes in interest rates. The growth of these deposit balances is subject to heightened competition, the success of the Company's sales efforts, delivery of superior customer service, new regulations and market conditions. The Company does not aggressively solicit higher-costing time deposits; as a result, Management anticipates such deposits will decline. Changes in interest rates, most notably rising interest rates, could impact deposit volumes. Depending on economic conditions, interest rate levels, liquidity management and a variety of other conditions, deposit growth may be used to fund loans or purchase investment securities. However, due to possible volatility in economic conditions, competition and political uncertainty, loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain. Shareholder dividends are expected to continue subject to the Board's discretion and continuing evaluation of capital levels, earnings, asset quality and other factors.\nThe Company and the Bank routinely project capital levels by analyzing forecasted earnings, credit quality, securities valuations, shareholder dividends, asset volumes, share repurchase activity, stock option exercise proceeds, and other factors. Based on current capital projections, the Company and the Bank expect to maintain regulatory capital levels exceeding the highest effective regulatory standard and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders. No assurance can be given that changes in capital management plans will not occur.\nAt December 31, 2015, the revenue bonds in the Company's investment securities portfolios were issued by state and local government municipalities and agencies to fund public services such as water utility, sewer utility, recreational and school facilities, and general public and economic improvements. The revenue bonds were payable from 22 revenue sources. The revenue sources that represent 5% or more individually of the total revenue bonds are summarized in the following table.\nThe following table sets forth the relative maturities and contractual yields of the Company's available for sale securities (stated at fair value) at December 31, 2016. Yields on state and political subdivision securities have been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current federal statutory rate. Mortgage-backed securities are shown separately because they are typically paid in monthly installments over a number of years.\n -35- \nManagement considers the $26.0 million allowance for loan losses to be adequate as a reserve against loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of December 31, 2016.\nLiquidity risk can result from the mismatching of asset and liability cash flows, or from disruptions in the financial markets. The Company performs liquidity stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its liquidity. Under the stress testing, the Company assumes outflows of funds increase beyond expected levels. Measurement of such heightened outflows considers the composition of the Company's deposit base, including any concentration of deposits, non-deposit funding such as short-term borrowings, and unfunded lending commitments. The Company evaluates its stock of highly liquid assets to meet the assumed higher levels of outflows. Highly liquid assets include cash and amounts due from other banks from daily transaction settlements, reduced by branch cash needs and Federal Reserve Bank reserve requirements, and investment securities based on regulatory risk-weighting guidelines. Based on the results of the most recent liquidity stress test, Management is satisfied with the liquidity condition of the Bank and the Company. However, no assurance can be given the Bank or Company will not experience a period of reduced liquidity.\nLiquidity and Funding\n\nIn 2016, noninterest expense decreased $3.5 million or 3.4% compared with 2015. Expenses for other real estate owned in 2016 were reduced by net gains from the sale of foreclosed properties. Occupancy expense decreased $844 thousand in 2016 compared with 2015 mostly due to branch closures and a lease expiration related to a non-branch building. Salaries and related benefits decreased $685 thousand primarily due to employee attrition, offset in part by higher expenses for stock based compensation. Courier expense decreased $377 thousand primarily due to logistical changes and switching to new vendors. Amortization of identifiable intangibles decreased $352 thousand as assets are amortized on a declining balance method. Other operating expense decreased $2.3 million primarily due to lower expenses for correspondent service fees (down $1.3 million), FDIC insurance assessments (down $535 thousand) and operating losses on limited partnership investments (down $375 thousand). Two categories of expense offset the decrease: Professional fees increased $1.5 million due to higher legal fees associated with loan administration and collection activities. Furniture and equipment expense increased $467 thousand mainly due to increased depreciation costs for technology.\nThe Company maintains an investment securities portfolio consisting of securities issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities, agency and non-agency mortgage backed securities, state and political subdivisions, corporations, and asset-backed and other securities. Investment securities are held in safekeeping by an independent custodian.\n\nThe allowance for loan losses and recorded investment in loans were evaluated for impairment as follows:\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the investment securities.\n -29- \n\n\nManagement believes the overall credit quality of the loan portfolio is reasonably stable; however, classified and nonperforming assets could fluctuate from period to period. The performance of any individual loan can be affected by external factors such as the interest rate environment, economic conditions, and collateral values or factors particular to the borrower. No assurance can be given that additional increases in nonaccrual and delinquent loans will not occur in the future.\n\nThe following tables set forth a summary of the changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in average assets and liability balances (volume) and changes in average interest yields/rates for the periods indicated. Changes not solely attributable to volume or yields/rates have been allocated in proportion to the respective volume and yield/rate components.\nThe Company extends loans to commercial and consumer customers which expose the Company to the risk borrowers will default, causing loan losses. The Company's lending activities are exposed to various qualitative risks. All loan segments are exposed to risks inherent in the economy and market conditions. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial loan segment include the borrowers' business performance and financial condition, and the value of collateral for secured loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the commercial real estate segment include the borrowers' business performance and the value of properties collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the construction loan segment include the borrowers' performance in successfully developing the real estate into the intended purpose and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the residential real estate segment include the borrowers' financial wherewithal to service the mortgages and the value of the property collateralizing the loans. Significant risk characteristics related to the consumer loan segment include the financial condition of the borrowers and the value of collateral securing the loans.\nThe Company's strategy includes building the value of its deposit base by building balances of lower-costing deposits and avoiding reliance on higher-costing time deposits. From 2014 to 2016 higher costing time deposits declined from 10% to 6% of total deposits. The Company's average balances of checking and savings accounts represented 94% of average balances of total deposits in 2016 compared with 93% in 2015 and 90% in 2014.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nIn 2015, noninterest expense decreased $1.5 million or 1.4% compared with 2014 primarily due to decreases in personnel costs and other operational expenses. Salaries and related benefits decreased $2.6 million primarily due to employee attrition. Amortization of identifiable intangibles decreased as assets are amortized on a declining balance method. Courier expense decreased primarily due to consolidating service runs. OREO expense in 2015 included net writedowns while in 2014 the Company realized net gains on disposition of foreclosed assets. Furniture and equipment expense increased primarily due to higher depreciation costs resulting from computer and software upgrades and higher software license fees.\nThe Company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and follows a strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk. The Bank's organization structure separates the functions of business development and loan underwriting; Management believes this segregation of duties avoids inherent conflicts of combining business development and loan approval functions. In measuring and managing credit risk, the Company adheres to the following practices.\n (3) Net interest margin is computed by calculating the difference between interest income and expense, divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin is greater than the net interest spread due to the benefit of noninterest-bearing demand deposits. \n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nSee Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the loan portfolio, loan portfolio credit risk, and allowance for loan losses.\n\n(3) Includes 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nThe Company has been replacing higher-cost funding sources with low-cost deposits and interest expense has declined to offset some of the decline in interest income. Interest expense has been reduced by lowering rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowings and by reducing the volume of higher-cost funding sources. A $10 million term repurchase agreement was repaid in August 2014 and Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d) advances were repaid in January 2015. Average balances of time deposits declined $62 million in 2016 compared with 2015 while lower-cost checking and savings deposits grew 5% in the same period. Lower-cost checking and savings deposits accounted for 94.1% of total average deposits in 2016 compared with 92.5% in 2015 and 89.8% in 2014.\nThe Company performs capital stress tests on a periodic basis to evaluate the sustainability of its capital. Under the stress testing, the Company assumes various scenarios such as deteriorating economic and operating conditions, unanticipated asset devaluations, and significant operational lapses. The Company measures the impact of these scenarios on its earnings and capital. Based on the results of the most recent stress tests, Management is satisfied with the capital condition of the Bank and the Company. However, no assurance can be given the Bank or Company will not experience a period of reduced earnings or a reduction in capital from unanticipated events and circumstances.\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe final rule did not supersede provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (FDICIA) requiring federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action (PCA) to resolve problems of insured depository institutions. The final rule revised the PCA thresholds to incorporate the higher minimum levels of capital, including the common equity tier 1\u201d ratio.\nThe Company reported net income of $58.9 million or $2.29 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with net income of $58.8 million or $2.30 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2015 and net income of $60.6 million or $2.32 diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and follow general practices within the banking industry. Application of these principles requires the Company to make certain estimates, assumptions, and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions, and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements; accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions, and judgments. Certain accounting policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates, assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported. Estimates, assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value, when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment writedown or valuation reserve to be established, or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event. Carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility. The fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third-party sources, when available.\nAt December 31, 2016, the Company's investment securities portfolios included securities issued by 698 state and local government municipalities and agencies located within 44 states with a fair value of $848.2 million. None of the Company's investment securities were issued by Puerto Rican government entities. The largest exposure to any one municipality or agency was $10.0 million (fair value) represented by nine general obligation bonds.\n(2) Federal National Mortgage Association\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n (3) Net interest margin is computed by calculating the difference between interest income and expense, divided by the average balance of interest-earning assets. The net interest margin is greater than the net interest spread due to the benefit of noninterest-bearing demand deposits. \nConsumer installment and other loans are predominantly comprised of indirect automobile loans with underwriting based on credit history and scores, personal income, debt service capacity, and collateral values.\nCommitments and Letters of Credit\n \u00b7 The Bank maintains two loan administration offices whose sole responsibility is to manage and collect classified loans. \n -19- \nPurchased loans were recorded on the date of purchase at estimated fair value; fair value discounts include a component for estimated loan losses. The Company evaluates all nonaccrual purchased loans with outstanding principal balances in excess of $500 thousand for impairment; the impaired loan value is compared to the recorded investment in the loan, which has been reduced by the loan default discount estimated on the date of purchase. If Management's impairment analysis determines the impaired loan value is less than the recorded investment in the purchased loan, an allocation of the allowance for loan losses is established for the deficiency. For all other purchased loan portfolio segments, Management applies loss rates to the purchased loan portfolio segments to determine initial allocations of the allowance. Further, liquidating purchased consumer installment loans are evaluated separately by applying historical loss rates to forecasted liquidating principal balances to initially measure losses inherent in this portfolio segment. The initial allocations of the allowance to purchased loan portfolio segments are compared to loan default discounts ascribed to each segment. Management establishes allocations of the allowance for loan losses for any estimated deficiency.\nFurther detail of federal funds purchased and other borrowed funds is as follows:\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nCritical Accounting Policies\n\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe following sets forth, by time remaining to maturity, the Company's domestic time deposits in amounts of $100 thousand or more:\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nDeposit Categories\nComparing 2016 with 2015, net interest and loan fee income (FTE) decreased $3.2 million due to lower average balances of loans (down $194 million), partially offset by higher average balances of investments (up $255 million) and lower average balances of higher-costing time deposits (down $62 million).\nLoan volumes have declined due to problem loan workout activities (such as chargeoffs, collateral repossessions and principal payments), particularly with purchased loans, and reduced volumes of loan originations. In Management's opinion, current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential. As a result, the Company has not currently taken an aggressive posture relative to loan portfolio growth. Management has increased investment securities as loan volumes have declined. The average balance of the investment securities portfolio increased from $2.4 billion in 2014 to $2.8 billion in 2015 and $3.1 billion in 2016. The Company, in anticipation of rising interest rates, has been purchasing floating rate and shorter-duration investment securities with lower yields than longer-duration securities to increase liquidity. The Company's high levels of liquidity will provide an opportunity to obtain higher yielding assets assuming market interest rates start rising.\nThe Company's primary capital resource is shareholders' equity, which was $561 million at December 31, 2016 compared with $532 million at December 31, 2015. The Company's ratio of equity to total assets was 10.46% at December 31, 2016 and 10.30% at December 31, 2015.\n -36- \nComparing 2016 with 2015, net income increased $100 thousand due to a reversal of provision for loan losses and lower noninterest expense, partially offset by lower net interest and fee income (FTE), lower noninterest income and higher income tax provision (FTE). The lower net interest and fee income (FTE) was primarily caused by lower average balances of loans, partially offset by higher average balances of investments and lower average balances of higher-costing time deposits. The Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million, reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio. Noninterest income decreased primarily due to reduced levels of service charges on deposit accounts, financial services commissions and other service fees, partially offset by higher debit card fees. Noninterest expense decreased mostly due to lower personnel expense, lower occupancy expense, and lower other operating expense, offset in part by higher legal fees. Income tax provision (FTE) increased in 2016 due to higher pretax income, declining tax preference items and lower tax credits.\nProvision for Income Tax\n \u00b7 Increased the risk-weighting of certain assets, and \nHeld to Maturity Portfolio Maturity Distribution\n -24- \nIn 2016, noninterest income decreased $1.4 million or 2.7% compared with 2015. Service charges on deposits decreased $1.4 million due to declines in fees charged on overdrawn and insufficient funds accounts (down $1.1 million) and lower fees on analyzed accounts (down $393 thousand), partially offset by the effect of deposit fee increases effective February 2016. The decrease was partially offset by increased debit card fees of $206 thousand as a result of increased transaction volumes.\nThe Company primarily attracts deposits from local businesses and professionals, as well as through retail savings and checking accounts, and, to a more limited extent, certificates of deposit.\nAvailable for Sale Portfolio\n -22- \n(2) Includes 2.5% capital conservation buffer.\nMarket Risk - Equity Markets\nCommercial real estate loans represent term loans used to acquire real estate to be operated by the borrower in a commercial capacity. Underwriting practices evaluate each borrower's global cash flow as the principal source of loan repayment, independent appraisal of value of the property, and other relevant factors. Commercial real estate loans are generally secured by a first lien on the property as a secondary source of repayment.\n -21- \nThe Company has historically generated high levels of earnings, which provide a means of accumulating capital. The Company's net income as a percentage of average shareholders' equity ( return on equity\u201d or ROE\u201d) has been 10.9% in 2016, 11.3% in 2015 and 11.6% in 2014. The Company also raises capital as employees exercise stock options. Capital raised through the exercise of stock options was $24 million in 2016 compared with $5 million in 2015 and $12 million in 2014.\n -34- \nThe Company's asset and liability position was neutral\u201d to slightly asset sensitive\u201d at December 31, 2016, depending on the interest rate assumptions applied to the simulation model employed by Management to measure interest rate risk. An asset sensitive\u201d position results in a slightly larger change in interest income than in interest expense resulting from application of assumed interest rate changes. Simulation estimates depend on, and will change with, the size and mix of the actual and projected balance sheet at the time of each simulation. Management continues to monitor the interest rate environment as well as economic conditions and other factors it deems relevant in managing the Company's exposure to interest rate risk.\n -32- \nThe Company's primary source of revenue is net interest income, or the difference between interest income earned on loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings.\nAs of December 31, 2016, substantially all of the Company's investment securities continue to be investment grade rated by one or more major rating agencies. In addition to monitoring credit rating agency evaluations, Management performs its own evaluations regarding the credit worthiness of the issuer or the securitized assets underlying asset-backed securities. The Company's procedures for evaluating investments in securities are in accordance with guidance issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Investing in Securities without Reliance on Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Agencies\u201d (SR 12-15) and other regulatory guidance. Credit ratings are considered in our analysis only as a guide to the historical default rate associated with similarly-rated bonds. There have been no significant differences in our internal analyses compared with the ratings assigned by the third party credit rating agencies.\nNet Income\nAt December 31, 2016, the revenue bonds in the Company's investment securities portfolios were issued by state and local government municipalities and agencies to fund public services such as water utility, sewer utility, recreational and school facilities, and general public and economic improvements. The revenue bonds were payable from 23 revenue sources. The revenue sources that represent 5% or more individually of the total revenue bonds are summarized in the following table.\nInvestment Securities Portfolio\nIn adjusting the Company's asset/liability position, Management attempts to manage interest rate risk while enhancing the net interest margin and net interest income. At times, depending on expected increases or decreases in general interest rates, the relationship between long and short-term interest rates, market conditions and competitive factors, Management may adjust the Company's interest rate risk position in order to manage its net interest margin and net interest income. The Company's results of operations and net portfolio values remain subject to changes in interest rates and to fluctuations in the difference between long and short-term interest rates.\n\n (2) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. \nThe decline in the unallocated allowance for loan losses during 2016 was generally due to the overall improved economic conditions and credit quality metrics.\nThe following table summarizes the Company's average daily amount of deposits and the rates paid for the periods indicated:\n\n -27- \n \u00b7 Introduced a capital conservation buffer,\u201d \n\nThe Bank's dividends paid to the Parent Company and proceeds from the exercise of stock options provided adequate cash flow for the Parent Company to pay shareholder dividends of $40 million in 2016, $39 million in 2015 and $40 million in 2014, and retire common stock in the amount of $6 million, $15 million and $53 million, respectively. Payment of dividends to the Parent Company by the Bank is limited under California and Federal laws. The Company believes these regulatory dividend restrictions will not have an impact on the Parent Company's ability to meet its ongoing cash obligations.\nProvision for Loan Losses\nCommercial loans represent term loans used to acquire durable business assets or revolving lines of credit used to finance working capital. Underwriting practices evaluate each borrower's cash flow as the principal source of loan repayment. Commercial loans are generally secured by the borrower's business assets as a secondary source of repayment. Commercial loans are evaluated for credit-worthiness based on prior loan performance, borrower financial information including cash flow, borrower net worth and aggregate debt.\n\nThe following tables summarize the total general obligation and revenue bonds issued by states and political subdivisions held in the Company's investment securities portfolios as of the dates indicated, identifying the state in which the issuing government municipality or agency operates.\n -42- \nManagement continually evaluates the Company's investment securities portfolio in response to established asset/liability management objectives, changing market conditions that could affect profitability, liquidity, and the level of interest rate risk to which the Company is exposed. These evaluations may cause Management to change the level of funds the Company deploys into investment securities and change the composition of the Company's investment securities portfolio. In 2016 Management reduced securities of U.S. Government sponsored entities to reduce call optionality and increased agency residential MBS to develop more reliable cash flows.\nDeposit Distribution and Average Rates Paid\n\nComponents of Net Income\n (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. \nFinancial Ratios\nThe following table sets forth the short-term borrowings of the Company:\nTime Deposits $100,000 or more Maturity Distribution\n -20- \n(1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate.\nThe Company's earnings are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the United States government and its agencies, particularly the Federal Reserve Board (the FRB\u201d). The monetary policies of the FRB can influence the overall growth of loans, investment securities, and deposits and the level of interest rates earned on assets and paid for liabilities. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies are generally not predictable.\nComparing 2015 with 2014, net interest and fee income (FTE) decreased $4.4 million or 2.9% primarily due to a lower average volume of loans (down $155 million) and lower yields on interest-earning assets (FTE) (down 37 basis points bp\u201d), partially offset by higher average balances of investments (up $436 million) and lower average balances of higher-costing interest-bearing liabilities.\nBanking organizations that are not subject to the advanced approaches rule\u201d began complying with the final rule on January 1, 2015; on such date, the Company and the Bank became subject to the revised definitions of regulatory capital, the new minimum regulatory capital ratios, and various regulatory capital adjustments and deductions according to transition provisions and timelines. All banking organizations began calculating standardized total risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2015. The transition period for the capital conservation buffer for all banking organizations began on January 1, 2016 and will end January 1, 2019. Any bank subject to the rule which is unable to maintain its capital conservation buffer\u201d will be restricted in the payment of discretionary executive compensation and shareholder distributions, such as dividends and share repurchases.\n(1) Includes 0.625% capital conservation buffer.\n (2) Net interest spread represents the average yield earned on interest-earning assets less the average rate incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. \nContractual Obligations\n -44- \nSummary of Changes in Interest Income and Expense\n\nAsset/Liability and Market Risk Management\n\n \u00b7 Established limits on the amount of deferred tax assets with any excess treated as a deduction from Tier 1 capital. \n\nThe Company issues formal commitments on lines of credit to well-established and financially responsible commercial enterprises. Such commitments can be either secured or unsecured and are typically in the form of revolving lines of credit for seasonal working capital needs. Occasionally, such commitments are in the form of letters of credit to facilitate the customers' particular business transactions. Commitment fees are generally charged for commitments and letters of credit. Commitments on lines of credit and letters of credit typically mature within one year. For further information, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe income tax provision (FTE) was $34.2 million in 2016 compared with $32.1 million in 2015 and $34.2 million in 2014. The 2016 effective tax rate (FTE) was 36.8% compared with 35.3% in 2015 and 36.1% in 2014. The effective tax rates without FTE adjustments were 26.4% for 2016 and 23.4% for 2015 and 23.2% for 2014. The effective tax rates for 2016 were higher than the effective tax rates for 2015 and 2014 due to higher pre-tax income and declining tax preference items. Interest income earned on municipal securities and tax free loans which are exempt from federal income taxes have declined in 2016. The tax credits earned from investments in limited partnerships have also declined in 2016.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by the Company are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. These policies, along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this discussion, provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined. Based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods, assumptions, and estimates underlying those amounts, Management has identified the allowance for loan losses accounting to be the accounting area requiring the most subjective or complex judgments, and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available. A discussion of the factors affecting accounting for the allowance for loan losses and purchased loans is included in the Loan Portfolio Credit Risk\u201d discussion below.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nComparing 2015 with 2014, net income decreased $1.9 million or 3.1%, primarily due to lower net interest and loan fee income (FTE) and lower noninterest income, partially offset by decreases in loan loss provision, noninterest expense and income tax provision (FTE). The lower net interest and loan fee income (FTE) was primarily caused by a lower average volume of loans and lower yields on interest-earning assets, partially offset by higher average balances of investments and lower average balances of higher-costing interest-bearing liabilities. The provision for loan losses was reduced, reflecting Management's evaluation of losses inherent in the loan portfolio; net loan losses and nonperforming loan volumes have declined relative to earlier periods. Lower noninterest income was mostly attributable to lower merchant processing service fees and lower service charges on deposit accounts. Noninterest expense decreased primarily due to reduced personnel costs and other operational expenses.\nThe following tables present information regarding the consolidated average assets, liabilities and shareholders' equity, the amounts of interest income earned from average interest earning assets and the resulting yields, and the amounts of interest expense incurred on average interest-bearing liabilities and the resulting rates. Average loan balances include nonperforming loans. Interest income includes reversal of previously accrued interest on loans placed on non-accrual status during the period and proceeds from loans on nonaccrual status only to the extent cash payments have been received and applied as interest income and accretion of purchased loan discounts. Yields on tax-exempt securities and loans have been adjusted upward to reflect the effect of income exempt from federal income taxation at the current statutory tax rate.\nComponents of Noninterest Income\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company's investment securities portfolios included securities issued by 725 state and local government municipalities and agencies located within 44 states with a fair value of $864.2 million. None of the Company's investment securities were issued by Puerto Rican government entities. The largest exposure to any one municipality or agency was $10.3 million (fair value) represented by nine general obligation bonds.\nThe following table sets forth the relative maturities and contractual yields of the Company's held to maturity securities at December 31, 2016. Yields on state and political subdivision securities have been calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current federal statutory rate. Mortgage-backed securities are shown separately because they are typically paid in monthly installments over a number of years.\t\n -45- \nComponents of Net Interest and Loan Fee Income (FTE)\n\nNonperforming Assets\nNet Interest and Loan Fee Income (FTE)\n -28- \nThe following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio of the Company by type of loan and type of borrower, on the dates indicated:\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nOperating lease obligations have not been reduced by minimum sublease rentals of $2 million due in the future under noncancelable subleases. Operating lease obligations may be retired prior to the contractual maturity as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. The purchase obligation consists of the Company's minimum liabilities under contracts with third-party automation services providers.\nThe former County Bank loans and repossessed loan collateral were purchased from the FDIC with indemnifying loss-sharing agreements. The loss-sharing agreement on single-family residential real estate assets expires February 6, 2019. The loss-sharing agreement on non-single-family residential real estate assets expired February 6, 2014 as to losses and expired February 6, 2017 as to loss recoveries.\nAsset/liability management involves the evaluation, monitoring and management of interest rate risk, market risk, liquidity and funding. The fundamental objective of the Company's management of assets and liabilities is to maximize its economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and a conservative level of interest rate risk.\n (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. \n -31- \n\nIn 2015, noninterest income decreased $3.9 million or 7.6% compared with 2014. Service charges on deposits decreased $2.0 million compared with 2014 due to declines in fees charged on overdrawn and insufficient funds accounts (down $913 thousand), lower fees on analyzed accounts (down $661 thousand) and lower activity on checking accounts (down $325 thousand). Merchant processing services declined $880 thousand primarily due to lower transaction volumes.\n\nThe objective of liquidity management is to manage cash flow and liquidity reserves so that they are adequate to fund the Company's operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. The Company achieves this objective through the selection of asset and liability maturity mixes that it believes best meet its needs. The Company's liquidity position is enhanced by its ability to raise additional funds as needed in the wholesale markets.\n \u00b7 The Bank maintains a Loan Review Department which reports directly to the Board of Directors. The Loan Review Department performs independent evaluations of loans and assigns credit risk grades to evaluated loans using grading standards employed by bank regulatory agencies. Those loans judged to carry higher risk attributes are referred to as classified loans.\u201d Classified loans receive elevated management attention to maximize collection. \n \u00b7 Established higher minimum levels of capital, \nThe remainder of the allowance is considered to be unallocated. The unallocated allowance is established to provide for probable losses that have been incurred as of the reporting date but not reflected in the allocated allowance. The unallocated allowance addresses additional qualitative factors consistent with Management's analysis of the level of risks inherent in the loan portfolio, which are related to the risks of the Company's general lending activity. Included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses that are attributable to national or local economic or industry trends which have occurred but have not yet been recognized in loan chargeoff history (external factors). The primary external factor evaluated by the Company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by Management as of December 31, 2016 is economic and business conditions $0.7 million. Also included in the unallocated allowance is the risk of losses attributable to general attributes of the Company's loan portfolio and credit administration (internal factors). The internal factors evaluated by the Company and the judgmental amount of unallocated reserve assigned by Management are: loan review system $1.4 million, adequacy of lending Management and staff $1.1 million and concentrations of credit $1.3 million.\nSummary of Changes in Interest Income and Expense due to Changes in Average Asset & Liability Balances and Yields Earned & Rates Paid\nCapital to Risk-Adjusted Assets\n\n\n -39- \nMarket values of loan collateral can directly impact the level of loan chargeoffs and the provision for loan losses. The financial condition and liquidity of debtors issuing bonds and debtors whose mortgages or other obligations are securitized can directly impact the credit quality of the Company's investment securities portfolio requiring the Company to recognize other than temporary impairment charges. Other types of market risk, such as foreign currency exchange risk, are not significant in the normal course of the Company's business activities.\nIn recent years, the Company's deposit base has provided the majority of the Company's funding requirements. This relatively stable and low-cost source of funds, along with shareholders' equity, provided 98 percent of funding for average total assets in 2016 and 97 percent in 2015. The stability of the Company's funding from customer deposits is in part reliant on the confidence clients have in the Company. The Company places a very high priority in maintaining this confidence through conservative credit and capital management practices and by maintaining an appropriate level of liquidity reserves.\nHeld to Maturity Portfolio\nThe Company originates loans with the intent to hold such assets until principal is repaid. Management follows written loan underwriting policies and procedures which are approved by the Bank's Board of Directors. Loans are underwritten following approved underwriting standards and lending authorities within a formalized organizational structure. The Board of Directors also approves independent real estate appraisers to be used in obtaining estimated values for real property serving as loan collateral. Prevailing economic trends and conditions are also taken into consideration in loan underwriting practices.\n \u00b7 Introduced a new Common Equity Tier 1\u201d capital measurement, \n -30- \nThe following table shows the fair value carrying amount of the Company's investment securities available for sale as of the dates indicated:\n -40- \nThe following table summarizes the allowance for loan losses, chargeoffs and recoveries of the Company for the periods indicated:\nMarket Risk - Other\n\nLoan Portfolio\n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe Company recorded a reversal of the provision for loan losses of $3.2 million in 2016. The Company provided no provision for loan losses in 2015 compared with $2.8 million in 2014. During 2016, classified loans declined $17.1 million (which included nonperforming loans of $8.9 million). The Company's net losses of prior loan losses decreased from $3.0 million in 2014 and $1.7 million in 2015 to $617 thousand in 2016; these developments were reflected in Management's evaluation of credit quality, the level of the provision for loan losses, and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2016. Management's evaluation of credit quality includes originated and purchased loans. The Company recorded purchased loans at estimated fair value upon the acquisition dates. Such estimated fair values were recognized for individual loans, although small balance homogenous loans were pooled for valuation purposes. The valuation discounts recorded for purchased loans included Management's assessment of the risk of principal loss under economic and borrower conditions prevailing on the dates of purchase. The purchased County Bank loans secured by single-family residential real estate are covered\u201d through February 6, 2019 by loss-sharing agreements the Company entered with the FDIC which mitigates losses during the term of the agreements. Any deterioration in estimated value related to principal loss subsequent to the acquisition dates requires additional loss recognition through a provision for loan losses. No assurance can be given future provisions for loan losses related to purchased loans will not be necessary. For further information regarding credit risk, the FDIC loss-sharing agreements, net credit losses and the allowance for loan losses, see the Loan Portfolio Credit Risk\u201d and Allowance for Loan Losses\u201d sections of this Report.\n (1) Amounts calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis using the current statutory federal tax rate. \nTotal time deposits were $256 million and $287 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The following table sets forth, by time remaining to maturity, the Company's total domestic time deposits. The Company has no foreign time deposits.\nAll loan applications must be for clearly defined legitimate purposes with a determinable primary source of repayment, and as appropriate, secondary sources of repayment. All loans are supported by appropriate documentation such as current financial statements, tax returns, credit reports, collateral information, guarantor asset verification, title reports, appraisals, and other relevant documentation.\nThe following table shows key financial ratios for the periods indicated:\nThe following table shows the maturity distribution and interest rate sensitivity of commercial, commercial real estate, and construction loans at December 31, 2016. Balances exclude residential real estate loans and consumer loans totaling $453.3 million. These types of loans are typically paid in monthly installments over a number of years.\nThe Company manages credit costs by consistently enforcing conservative underwriting and administration procedures and aggressively pursuing collection efforts with debtors experiencing financial difficulties. The provision for loan losses reflects Management's assessment of credit risk in the loan portfolio during each of the periods presented.\nThe Company paid common dividends totaling $40 million in 2016, $39 million in 2015 and $40 million in 2014, which represent dividends per common share of $1.56, $1.53 and $1.52, respectively. The Company's earnings have historically exceeded dividends paid to shareholders. The amount of earnings in excess of dividends provides the Company resources to finance growth and maintain appropriate levels of shareholders' equity. In the absence of profitable growth opportunities, the Company has repurchased and retired its common stock as another means to return earnings to shareholders. The Company repurchased and retired 137 thousand shares valued at $6 million in 2016, 344 thousand shares valued at $15 million in 2015 and 1.0 million shares valued at $53 million in 2014.\nNoninterest Income\n\nEquity price risk can affect the Company. As an example, any preferred or common stock holdings, as permitted by banking regulations, can fluctuate in value. Management regularly assesses the extent and duration of any declines in market value, the causes of such declines, the likelihood of a recovery in market value, and its intent to hold securities until a recovery in value occurs. Declines in value of preferred or common stock holdings that are deemed other than temporary\u201d could result in loss recognition in the Company's income statement.\nDistribution of Assets, Liabilities & Shareholders' Equity and Yields, Rates & Interest Margin\nFor management purposes, the Company segregates its loan portfolio into three segments. Loans originated by the Company following its loan underwriting policies and procedures are separated from loans purchased from the FDIC. Loan volumes have declined due to problem loan workout activities, particularly with purchased loans, and reduced volumes of loan originations. In Management's opinion, current levels of competitive loan pricing do not provide adequate forward earnings potential. As a result, the Company has not currently taken an aggressive posture relative to loan portfolio growth.\nYields on interest-earning assets declined due to historically low interest rates prevailing in the market. The net interest margin (FTE) was 3.24% in 2016, 3.36% in 2015 and 3.70% in 2014. The volume of older-dated higher-yielding loans and securities declined due to principal maturities and paydowns. Newly originated loans have lower yields. As the investment securities portfolio grew during the three years ended December 31, 2016, the investment securities portfolio generated an increasing portion of the interest income (FTE). Interest income (FTE) generated from investments represented 41.8% of total interest income (FTE) in 2014, 47.0% in 2015 and 52.2% in 2016. During the three years ended December 31, 2016, the net interest margin (FTE) was affected by low market interest rates and the changing composition of interest-earning assets.\nThe Company's allowance for loan losses represents Management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio. In evaluating credit risk for loans, Management measures loss potential of the carrying value of loans. As described above, payments received on nonaccrual loans may be applied against the principal balance of the loans until such time as full collection of the remaining recorded balance is expected. Further, the carrying value of purchased loans includes fair value discounts assigned at the time of purchase under the provisions of FASB ASC 805, Business Combinations, and FASB ASC 310-30, Loans or Debt Securities with Deteriorated Credit Quality. The allowance for loan losses represents Management's estimate of loan losses in excess of these reductions to the carrying value of loans within the loan portfolio.\nComponents of Noninterest Expense\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule that implements changes to the regulatory capital framework for all banking organizations. The rule's provisions which most affected the regulatory capital requirements of the Company and the Bank:\nLoan Portfolio\n\n\n\n -41- \n[The remainder of this page intentionally left blank]\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires Management to estimate the amount of losses inherent in the loan portfolio and establish an allowance for credit losses. The allowance for credit losses is established by assessing a provision for loan losses against the Company's earnings. In estimating credit losses, Management must exercise judgment in evaluating information deemed relevant, such as financial information regarding individual borrowers, overall credit loss experience, the amount of past due, nonperforming and classified loans, recommendations of regulatory authorities, prevailing economic conditions and other information. The amount of ultimate losses on the loan portfolio can vary from the estimated amounts. Management follows a systematic methodology to estimate loss potential in an effort to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses.\n(1) The rates for total deposits reflect value of
