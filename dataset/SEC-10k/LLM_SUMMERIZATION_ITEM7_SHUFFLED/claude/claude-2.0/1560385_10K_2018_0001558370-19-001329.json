This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. See note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an overview of accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.\nOverview\nWe own controlling and non-controlling interests in a broad range of media and entertainment companies. Our most significant operating subsidiary, which is a reportable segment, is Sirius XM Holdings Inc. ( SIRIUS XM\u201d). SIRIUS XM provides a subscription based satellite radio service. SIRIUS XM also transmits a larger set of music and other channels through SIRIUS XM's streaming service. SIRIUS XM's streaming services is available online and through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nOn September 7, 2016, Liberty, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Liberty GR Cayman Acquisition Company, entered into two definitive stock purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of Delta Topco, the parent company of Formula 1. The transactions contemplated by the first purchase agreement were completed on September 7, 2016, resulting in the acquisition of slightly less than a 20% minority stake in Formula 1 on an undiluted basis. On October 27, 2016 under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Liberty acquired an additional incremental equity interest of Delta Topco, maintaining Liberty's investment in Delta Topco on an undiluted basis and increasing slightly to 19.1% on a fully diluted basis. Liberty acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity interests of Delta Topco, other than a nominal number of shares held by certain Formula 1 teams, in a closing under the second purchase agreement (and following the unwind of the first purchase agreement) on January 23, 2017. See note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition. Liberty's acquired interest in Delta Topco and by extension Formula 1, along with existing Formula 1 cash and debt (which is non-recourse to Liberty), was attributed to the Formula One Group upon completion of the Second Closing. Formula 1 is a reportable segment.\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes a consolidated subsidiary, Braves Holdings, LLC ( Braves Holdings\u201d) and corporate expenses. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. ( Live Nation\u201d), which is accounted for as an equity method investment at December 31, 2018 and is included in corporate and other. We also maintain minority positions in other public companies.\nAs discussed in note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on April 15, 2016, Liberty completed the Recapitalization. Upon completion of the Second Closing, as discussed below, the Liberty Media Group was renamed the Formula One Group. Although the Recapitalization was not effective for all periods presented herein, information has been presented among the tracking stock groups for all periods presented as if the Recapitalization had been completed for all periods presented. This attribution of historical financial information does not purport to be what actual results and balances would have been if the Recapitalization had actually occurred and been in place during the periods prior to April 15, 2016. Operating results prior to the Recapitalization are attributed to Liberty stockholders in the aggregate.\nA tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or track\u201d the economic performance of a particular business or group,\u201d rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Liberty Braves Group (the Braves Group\u201d) and Formula One Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Formula One Group. Holders of tracking stock\nII-6\nare also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.\nThe term Liberty SiriusXM Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Liberty SiriusXM Group is primarily comprised of Liberty's subsidiary, SIRIUS XM, corporate cash, investments in debt securities, Liberty's 2.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048 and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. As of December 31, 2018, the Liberty SiriusXM Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $91 million, which includes $54 million of subsidiary cash.\nSIRIUS XM is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event SIRIUS XM were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty's management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and take appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty's management and its board of directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty's tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty's tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether. On February 1, 2019, SIRIUS XM acquired Pandora Media, Inc. ( Pandora\u201d). See note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the acquisition of Pandora.\nThe term Braves Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Braves Group is primarily comprised of Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club ( ANLBC,\u201d the Braves,\u201d or the Atlanta Braves\u201d) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC's stadium and mixed use development project (the Development Project\u201d) and corporate cash. As of December 31, 2018, the Braves Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $107 million, which includes $40 million of subsidiary cash. Additionally, as discussed below, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group. See note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering.\nThe term Formula One Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. As of December 31, 2018, the Formula One Group (formerly the Liberty Media Group) is primarily comprised of all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Braves Group, including Liberty's interests in Formula 1 and Live Nation, Liberty's 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty's 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023, Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046 and Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048. Following the creation of the tracking stocks and the closing of the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group of approximately 15.1%, valued at $226 million, as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Formula One Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $160 million, which includes $30 million of subsidiary cash.\nStrategies and Challenges of Business Units\nSIRIUS XM.\u2003SIRIUS XM is focused on several initiatives to increase its revenue. SIRIUS XM regularly evaluates its business plans and strategy.

consolidated revenue increased $446 million and $2,318 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The 2018 increase was driven by revenue growth at SIRIUS XM, Braves Holdings and Formula 1 of $346 million, $56 million and $44 million, respectively. The 2017 increase was primarily driven by $1,783 million of Formula 1 revenue, as a result of the Company's acquisition of Formula 1 on January 23, 2017, and revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $411 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $124 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nII-9\nOperating income.\u2003Our consolidated operating income increased $117 million and decreased $340 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Operating losses decreased $114 million and operating income increased $73 million for Braves Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, and operating losses increased $70 million for Formula One Group during 2018 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in corporate and other operating losses for Formula One Group for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by costs related to the acquisition of Formula 1 recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. Formula One Group operating income decreased $483 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the favorable one-time net $511 million Vivendi lawsuit settlement during the first quarter of 2016, as discussed in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $195 million and Braves Group operating loss increased $52 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nStock-based compensation.\u2003Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to (1) options and stock appreciation rights for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees, (2) phantom stock appreciation rights granted to officers and employees of certain of our subsidiaries pursuant to private equity plans and (3) amortization of restricted stock grants.\nWe recorded $192 million, $230 million and $150 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in stock compensation expense in 2018 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to decreases of $36 million and $8 million at Braves Holdings and Formula 1, respectively, partially offset by increases of $9 million at SIRIUS XM. The increase in stock compensation expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases of $37 million at Braves Holdings, $23 million at Formula 1 and $15 million at SIRIUS XM.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Liberty equity awards was approximately $22 million. Such amount will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested SIRIUS XM stock options and restricted stock units was $254 million. The SIRIUS XM unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.8 years.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nAdjusted OIBDA.\u2003We define Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses (excluding stock compensation), separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses, including each business's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.\nDuring the second quarter of 2018 and during the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $69 million, $45 million and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the $69 million, $45 million and $46 million of expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties expense line item in the accompanying consolidated financial\nII-10\nstatements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\nSIRIUS XM recognized approximately $43 million and $40 million of Revenue share and royalties within the consolidated statement of operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the SIRIUS XM legal settlement associated with SIRIUS XM's use of certain pre-1972 sound recordings. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, $108 million of the settlement amount recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 was excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding period, as this expense was not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the period, and this lump sum amount did not relate to the on-going performance of the business. Subsequent to the settlement during June 2015, SIRIUS XM recognized $43 million and $40 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, that is included as a component of Adjusted OIBDA.\nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $184 million and $720 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2018 as compared to the prior year was due to increases of $120 million and $86 million in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA, respectively, partially offset by a $22 million decrease in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to increases of $442 million in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA, Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $256 million and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $22 million.

The increase for 2018 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the average amount of corporate and subsidiary debt outstanding during the current period for Liberty SiriusXM Group and the capitalization of interest related to construction of the stadium and mixed-use facilities during the prior period for Braves Group, partially offset by decreases in interest expense for the Formula One Group due to decreases in the average amount of corporate and subsidiary debt outstanding. The increase in 2017 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately $167 million of interest expense attributable to debt held at Formula 1, which we began consolidating on January 23, 2017 when we acquired Formula 1. The remaining increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the average amount of corporate, SIRIUS XM and other subsidiary debt outstanding.\nII-12\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates.\u2003The following table presents our share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLiberty SiriusXM Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSIRIUS XM Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(10)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Liberty SiriusXM Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(11)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBraves Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Braves Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula One Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLive Nation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(18)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(12)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Formula One Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(8)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, an equity method affiliate of Braves Holdings sold a controlling interest in a subsidiary, resulting in Braves Holdings recording its portion of the gain of $69 million.\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments.\u2003Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following:\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt and equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(36)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDebt measured at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(126)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(113)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nChange in fair value of bond hedges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(94)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(88)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe changes in unrealized gains (losses) on debt and equity securities (as defined in note 3 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements) are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the stock underlying these financial instruments.\nChanges in unrealized gains (losses) on debt measured at fair value are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable.\nLiberty issued $1 billion of cash convertible notes in October 2013 which are accounted for at fair value, as elected by Liberty at the time of issuance of the notes. At the same time, Liberty entered into a bond hedge transaction on the same amount of underlying shares. These derivatives are marked to fair value on a recurring basis. The primary driver of the change in the fair value of bond hedges is the change in the fair value of the underlying stock.\nOther, net.\u2003The increase in 2018 was primarily due to a $48 million decrease in losses on early extinguishment of debt and a $17 million increase in gains on transactions, primarily driven by the sale of the residential portion of Braves Holdings' mixed-use complex. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a $19 million increase in interest and dividend income and a $12 million increase in gains on transactions, partially offset by a $24 million increase in losses on early extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the redemption of certain debt at SIRIUS XM. The loss in 2016 was primarily due to a $24 million loss on extinguishment of SIRIUS XM's redemption of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 during the\nII-13\nyear, partially offset by approximately $18 million in dividend and interest income, primarily due to dividends on Time Warner, Inc. shares.\nIncome taxes.\u2003Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was an expense of 17%, benefit of 129% and expense of 35%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for all three years was impacted for the following reasons:\nTable 171: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDuring 2018, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal tax rate of 21% U.S. due to deductible stock-based compensation, benefits related to federal tax credits and the resolution of historical matters with various tax authorities, partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance and taxable dividends not recognized for book purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDuring 2017, in connection with the initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), as discussed in note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a discrete net tax benefit, primarily driven by the corporate tax rate reduction.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDuring 2016, our effective tax rate was equal to the federal tax rate of 35% due to the offsetting impact of state income taxes and federal tax credits claimed by SIRIUS XM.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet earnings.\u2003We had net earnings of $865 million, $1,890 million and $924 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in net earnings was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2018, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, other government securities or government guaranteed funds, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments.\nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by the operating activities of our privately-owned subsidiaries (to the extent such cash exceeds the working capital needs of the subsidiaries and is not otherwise restricted), proceeds from net asset sales, monetization of our public investment portfolio, debt and equity issuances, available borrowing capacity under margin loans, and dividend and interest receipts.\nLiberty currently does not have a corporate debt rating.\nII-14\nAs of December 31, 2018, Liberty's cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered marketable equity securities were as follows:\nTable 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nUnencumbered\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nCash and Cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nMarketable\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEquivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nEquity Securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLiberty SiriusXM Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSIRIUS XM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Liberty SiriusXM Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBraves Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Braves Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula One Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCorporate and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Formula One Group\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n\t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo the extent the Company recognizes any taxable gains from the sale of assets we may incur tax expense and be required to make tax payments, thereby reducing any cash proceeds. Additionally, the Company has a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM which has significant cash flows provided by operating activities, although due to SIRIUS XM being a separate public company and the significant noncontrolling interest, we do not have ready access to its cash. Cash held by Formula 1 is accessible by Liberty, except when certain restricted payment tests imposed by the Senior Loan Facility at Formula 1 are not met. As of December 31, 2018, Liberty had $750 million available under a $1.35 billion margin loan due 2020 and $600 million available under the Live Nation Margin Loan. Certain tax consequences may reduce the net amount of cash that Liberty is able to utilize for corporate purposes. Liberty believes that it currently has appropriate legal structures in place to repatriate foreign cash as tax efficiently as possible and meet the business needs of the Company.\nThe cash provided (used) by our continuing operations for the prior three years is as follows:\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCash Flow Information\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLiberty SiriusXM Group cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,785\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,849\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBraves Group cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(42)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula One Group cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(75)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided (used) by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2,156\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,732\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLiberty SiriusXM Group cash provided (used) by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(756)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,254)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(210)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBraves Group cash provided (used) by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(413)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula One Group cash provided (used) by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,662)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(641)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided (used) by investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(370)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(3,137)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,264)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nLiberty SiriusXM Group cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,552)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(267)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,319)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nBraves Group cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(212)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula One Group cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(616)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,847\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNet cash provided (used) by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(2,380)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(546)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiberty's primary uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018 (excluding cash used by SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings) were $466 million of Series C Liberty SiriusXM common stock repurchases and $414 million of investments in equity method affiliates and debt and equity securities. These uses were funded by borrowings of debt and cash on hand.\nII-15\nSIRIUS XM's primary uses of cash were the repurchase of outstanding SIRIUS XM common stock, dividends paid to stockholders and additions to property and equipment resulting from new satellite construction. The SIRIUS XM uses of cash were funded by cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and borrowings of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2018, SIRIUS XM declared a cash dividend each quarter, and paid in cash an aggregate amount of $201 million, of which Liberty received $143 million. SIRIUS XM's board of directors expects to declare regular quarterly dividends, in an aggregate annual amount of $0.0484 per share of common stock. On January 29, 2019, SIRIUS XM's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock in the amount of $0.0121 per share of common stock, payable on February 28, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2019.\nFormula 1's primary use of cash was the net repayment of debt.\nThe projected uses of Liberty cash (excluding SIRIUS XM's, Formula 1's and Braves Holdings' uses of cash) are primarily the investment in new or existing businesses, debt service, including potential repayment of the outstanding margin loan and the potential buyback of common stock under the approved share buyback program. Liberty expects to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and borrowing capacity under margin loans and outstanding credit facilities. We may be required to make net payments of income tax liabilities to settle items under discussion with tax authorities.\nSIRIUS XM's uses of cash are expected to be operating expenses, capital expenditures, including the construction of replacement satellites, working capital requirements, interest payments, taxes and scheduled maturities of outstanding debt. Liberty expects SIRIUS XM to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash provided by operations and borrowings under the existing credit facility.\nFormula 1's uses of cash are expected to be debt service payments, as well as continued investment in its business. Liberty expects Formula 1 to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and cash provided by operations.\nBraves Holdings' uses of cash are expected to be expenditures related to the mixed-use development and new spring training facility. Liberty expects Braves Holdings to fund its projected uses of cash with borrowings under its existing debt instruments, cash provided by operations and through the issuance of new construction loans for Phase II. See Item 1. Business - (c) Narrative Description of Business - Braves Holdings, LLC - Mixed-use development.\nWe believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nSIRIUS XM has entered into various programming agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, SIRIUS XM's obligations include fixed payments, advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements. SIRIUS XM's future revenue sharing costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to estimate; therefore, they are not included in the schedule of contractual obligations below.\nThe Atlanta Braves have entered into long-term employment contracts with certain of their players and coaches whereby such individuals' compensation is guaranteed.

Additionally, SIRIUS XM has entered into various agreements with third parties for general operating purposes.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. All of these accounting estimates and assumptions, as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements, have been discussed with our audit committee.\nNon-Financial Instruments.\u2003Our non-financial instrument valuations are primarily comprised of our determination of the estimated fair value allocation of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in business\nII-17\ncombinations, our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks, and our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair value, we are required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statement of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from our long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value. As each of our operating segments has long-lived assets, this critical accounting policy affects the financial position and results of operations of each segment.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our significant reporting units were as follows (amounts in millions):\nTable 181: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nGoodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFCC Licenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSIRIUS XM\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n23,781\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFormula 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,956\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nConsolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n18,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,074\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n28,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets in the fourth quarter each year. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.\nUseful Life of Broadcast/Transmission System.\u2003SIRIUS XM's satellite system includes the costs of satellite construction, launch vehicles, launch insurance, capitalized interest, spare satellites, terrestrial repeater network and satellite uplink facilities. SIRIUS XM monitors its satellites for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable.\nSIRIUS XM operates two in-orbit Sirius satellites, FM-5 and FM-6. SIRIUS XM estimates that its FM-5 and FM-6 satellites, launched in 2009 and 2013, respectively, will operate effectively through the end of their depreciable lives in 2024 and 2028, respectively.\nSIRIUS XM operates three in-orbit XM satellites, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5. SIRIUS XM estimates that its XM-3 and XM-4 satellites launched in 2005 and 2006, respectively, will reach the end of their depreciable lives in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The XM-5 satellite that was launched in 2010, is used as an in-orbit spare for the Sirius and XM systems and is expected to reach the end of its depreciable life in 2025.\nSIRIUS XM's satellites have been designed to last fifteen-years. SIRIUS XM's in-orbit satellites may experience component failures which could adversely affect their useful lives. SIRIUS XM monitors the operating condition of its in-orbit satellites. If events or circumstances indicate that the depreciable lives of its in-orbit satellites have changed, the\nII-18\ndepreciable life will be modified accordingly. If SIRIUS XM were to revise its estimates, depreciation expense would change.\nIncome Taxes.\u2003We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into. Based on these judgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.\nResults of Operations-Businesses\nLiberty SiriusXM Group\nSIRIUS XM\u2003SIRIUS XM transmits its music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through its two proprietary satellite radio systems. SIRIUS XM also transmits a larger set of music and other channels through SIRIUS XM's streaming service. SIRIUS XM's streaming services is available online and through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nSIRIUS XM has agreements with every major automaker ( OEMs\u201d) to offer satellite radio in their vehicles, through which it acquires the majority of its subscribers. SIRIUS XM also acquires subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to SIRIUS XM's services. SIRIUS XM distributes its radios primarily through automakers, retailers and its website. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies.\nAs of December 31, 2018, SIRIUS XM had approximately 34.0 million subscribers of which approximately 28.9 million were self-pay subscribers and approximately 5.1 million were paid promotional subscribers. These subscriber totals include subscribers under regular pricing plans; discounted pricing plans; subscribers that have prepaid, including payments either made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle; subscribers to SIRIUS XM's streaming services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and certain subscribers to SIRIUS XM's weather, traffic and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions. Subscribers and subscription related revenue and expenses associated with the SIRIUS XM Canada service, which had approximately 2.6 million subscribers as of December 31, 2018, and SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services are not included in SIRIUS XM's subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.\nSIRIUS XM's primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of its customers subscribing to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans. SIRIUS XM offers discounts for prepaid subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount. SIRIUS XM also derives revenue from certain fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories and other ancillary services, such as weather, data and traffic services. SIRIUS XM provides traffic services to approximately 8.6 million vehicles.\nWe acquired a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM on January 18, 2013 and applied purchase accounting and consolidated the results of SIRIUS XM from that date. The results presented for SIRIUS XM below include the impacts of acquisition accounting adjustments in all periods presented. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, there is an approximate 27% noncontrolling interest in SIRIUS XM, and the net earnings of SIRIUS XM attributable to such noncontrolling interest is eliminated through the noncontrolling interest line item in the consolidated statement of\nII-19\noperations.

Subscriber revenue increased 3% and 7% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a 5% increase in the daily weighted average number of subscribers, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related amendments, which established Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ( ASC 606\u201d), effective as of January 1, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a 4% increase in the daily weighted average number of subscribers as well as a 3% increase in SIRIUS XM's average monthly revenue per subscriber resulting from certain rate increases.\nOther revenue includes advertising revenue, equipment revenue, royalty revenue and other ancillary revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other revenue increased 24% and 16%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by higher U.S. music royalty fee revenue due to a higher rate and an increase in the number of subscribers and higher revenue generated from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and SIRIUS XM Canada. In addition, equipment revenue increased due to additional royalty revenue due to SIRIUS XM's transition to a new generation of chipsets. The prior year increase was driven by higher revenue from Sirius XM Canada due to the new Services Agreement and Advisory Services Agreement entered into in the second quarter of 2017, additional revenue from the U.S. Music Royalty Fee due to an increase in the number of subscribers and subscribers paying at a higher rate and higher revenue generated from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services. Equipment revenue increased during the prior year driven by royalty revenue on certain satellite radio components starting in the second quarter of 2016 due to SIRIUS XM's transition to a new generation of chipsets and revenue from the sales of connected vehicle devices since the acquisition of Automatic, partially offset by lower revenue generated through satellite radio sales to distributors and consumers and lower OEM production. Advertising revenue increased during both periods due to a greater number of advertising spots sold and transmitted along with increased rates charged per spot.\nII-20\nCost of subscriber services includes revenue share and royalties, programming and content costs, customer service and billing expenses and other ancillary costs associated with providing the satellite radio service.\nTable 183: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nRevenue Share and Royalties (excluding legal settlements) includes distribution and content provider revenue share, royalties for transmitting content and web streaming, and advertising revenue share. Revenue share and royalties increased 14% and 10% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The increases during both years were primarily due to greater revenue subject to royalty and revenue sharing agreements and increases in the statutory royalty rate for the performance of sound recordings. During the second quarter of 2018, SIRIUS XM recorded a $69 million charge related to the legal settlement that resolved all outstanding claims, including ongoing audits, under SIRIUS XM's statutory license for sound recordings for the period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $45 and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. These expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nProgramming and Content includes costs to acquire, create, promote and produce content. Programming and content costs increased 5% and 8% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by increased personnel-related costs and higher music licensing costs.

Customer service and billing expense decreased 1% and 1% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The current year decrease was primarily driven by lower call center costs due to lower agent rates, increased customer self-service resulting in lower contact rates and improved non-pay process driving lower bad debt expense, partially offset by increased transaction fees from a larger subscriber base and personnel-related costs. The prior year decrease was primarily due to a decline in call center agent rates and contact rates, partially offset by increased transaction fees based on a higher subscriber base.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 186: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n\u00b7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOther includes costs associated with the operation and maintenance of SIRIUS XM's terrestrial repeater networks; satellites; satellite telemetry, tracking and control systems; satellite uplink facilities; studios; and delivery of SIRIUS XM's streaming service and connected vehicle services as well as costs from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories and provisions for inventory allowance attributable to products purchased for resale in SIRIUS XM's direct to consumer distribution channels. Other costs of subscriber services increased 8% and decreased 19% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The current year increase was primarily driven by higher wireless costs associated with SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and higher streaming costs, partially offset by lower direct satellite radio sales to consumers. The prior year decrease was driven by lower wireless costs associated with SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services, a reduction in terrestrial repeater costs as a result of the elimination of duplicative repeater sites, and lower sales to distributors and consumers, partially offset by increased streaming costs and the incremental costs associated with the sale of connected vehicle devices since the acquisition of Automatic.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSubscriber acquisition costs include hardware subsidies paid to radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers, including subsidies paid for chipsets and certain other components used in manufacturing radios; device royalties for certain radios and chipsets; product warranty obligations; and freight. The majority of subscriber acquisition costs are incurred and expensed in advance of, or concurrent with, acquiring a subscriber. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, subscriber acquisition costs decreased 6% and 3%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in\nII-21\nthe prior year. The decreases for both years were driven by reductions to OEM hardware subsidy rates, lower subsidized costs related to the transition of chipsets and decreases in satellite radio installations.\nOther operating expense includes engineering, design and development costs consisting primarily of compensation and related costs to develop chipsets and new products and services. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other operating expense increased 9% and 41%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase was driven by the continued development of SIRIUS XM's streaming product and connected vehicle services. The prior year increase was driven by the development of SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and additional costs associated with the development of SIRIUS XM's audio and video streaming products.\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, media and production, including promotional events and sponsorships; cooperative marketing; compensation and related personnel costs; facilities costs, finance, legal, human resources and information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 9% and 6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases for both years were due to additional subscriber communications, retention programs and acquisition campaigns as well as higher personnel-related costs. Additional increases during the year ended December 31, 2018 were driven by higher information technology costs, a one-time charge for sales and use taxes and expenses associated with the Pandora acquisition. The increases during the year ended December 31, 2017 were partially offset by the timing of certain OEM marketing campaigns, lower legal costs, litigation reserves and consulting costs.\nStock-based compensation increased 7% and 14% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. During the year ended December 31, 2018, SIRIUS XM recorded a one-time benefit to stock-based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This benefit was more than offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to an increase in the number of awards granted. The increase in the prior year is primarily due to an increase in the number of awards granted.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 5% and 13% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current year is driven by an increase in amortization expenses related to capitalized software additions and an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets placed in-service. The increase in the prior year was driven by the acceleration of amortization related to a shorter useful life of certain software as well as additional assets placed in-service.\nFormula One Group\nFormula 1.\u2003Formula 1 is a global motorsports business that holds exclusive commercial rights with respect to the World Championship, an annual, approximately nine-month long, motor race-based competition in which teams compete for the Constructors' Championship and drivers compete for the Drivers' Championship. The World Championship takes place on various circuits with various Events. Formula 1 is responsible for the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship. Formula 1 derives its primary revenue from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of entering into race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship arrangements. A significant majority of the race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship contracts specify payments in advance and annual increases in the fees payable over the course of the contracts.\nLiberty acquired a controlling interest in Formula 1 on January 23, 2017 and applied acquisition accounting and consolidated the results of Formula 1 from that date. Prior to the acquisition of our controlling interest, we maintained an investment in Formula 1 since September 7, 2016, which was accounted for as a cost method investment. Although Formula 1's results are only included in Liberty's results since January 23, 2017, we believe a discussion of Formula 1's results for all periods presented promotes a better understanding of the overall results of its business. For comparison and discussion purposes, we are presenting the pro forma results of Formula 1 for the full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, inclusive of acquisition accounting adjustments. The pro forma financial information was prepared based on the historical financial information of Formula 1 and assuming the acquisition of Formula 1 took place on January 1, 2016. The pro forma adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing comparative pro forma financial\nII-22\ninformation. The financial information below is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent the actual results of operations of Formula 1 had the business combination occurred on January 1, 2016, or to project the results of operations of Liberty for any future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that Liberty management believes are reasonable. The pro forma adjustments are directly attributable to the business combination and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of Liberty.\nFormula 1's operating results were as follows:\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(actual)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPrimary Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,483\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTotal Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,827\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,784\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating expenses (excluding stock-based compensation included below):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,273)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,256)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(154)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(125)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(90)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAdjusted OIBDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nStock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(16)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(24)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDepreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(452)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(451)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(403)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(68)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(37)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary Formula 1 revenue is derived from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of race promotion fees (earned from granting the rights to host, stage and promote each Event on the World Championship calendar), broadcasting fees (earned from licensing the right to broadcast Events on television and other platforms, including the internet) and advertising and sponsorship fees (earned from the sale of World Championship and Event-related advertising and sponsorship rights).\nThe World Championship calendar consisted of 21 Events, 20 Events and 21 Events during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nPrimary Formula 1 revenue increased $4 million and decreased $19 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year.\nThe increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by an increase in race promotion fees due to contractual increases in fees for certain Events and increased economics from contractual arrangements at one Event (which was fully offset by a decrease in advertising and sponsorship revenue, as discussed below). In addition, broadcasting revenue increased during the current period as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates used to translate Great Britain Pound and Euro-denominated contracts into U.S. Dollars and the impact of certain contractual rate increases, partially offset by the early termination of one contract with a failing broadcast rights holder. Advertising and sponsorship revenue decreased during the current period as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to revised contractual arrangements at one Event and non-renewal of another small sponsorship arrangement, partially offset by revenue from new contracts and increases in existing contracts.\nThe prior year decrease was due to one less Event during 2017 compared to 2016 and legacy contractual terms of one Event, which provided a one time significant decrease in race promotion fees after the 2016 season through the remaining term of that contract. These decreases in race promotion revenue were partially offset by the impact of other contractual increases. Broadcasting revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the impact of certain contractual rate increases, partially offset by the net adverse impact of weaker prevailing foreign currency exchange rates used to translate a small number of fees that were not denominated in U.S. Dollars. Advertising and sponsorship revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to\nII-23\nthe corresponding period in the prior year due to increased fees and growth in certain arrangements, partially offset by the non-renewal of two arrangements.\nOther Formula 1 revenue is generated from miscellaneous and ancillary sources primarily related to administering the shipment of cars and equipment to and from events outside of Europe, revenue from the sale of tickets to the Formula One Paddock Club at most Events, support races at Events (either from the direct operation of the and GP3 series (the latter of which will be replaced in 2019 by the series) or from the licensing of other third party series or individual race events), various television production and post-production activities, digital and social media services and other ancillary operations.\nOther Formula 1 revenue increased $39 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to pro forma Other Formula 1 revenue in the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current year was primarily attributable increases in revenue from the sale of the new chassis, engine and other components to the series' competing teams due to 2018 being the first year of the vehicle cycle, higher logistical and travel services revenue, higher digital media and television production related revenue and increased revenue from hospitality and various fan engagement and other event based activities.\nThe increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily attributable to higher logistics and digital media revenue, contributions from broadcasting in Ultra High Definition and higher hospitality revenue, partially offset by lower spend by GP3 series' competing teams during 2017 due to it being the second year of the GP3 vehicle cycle.\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(actual)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTeam payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(913)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(919)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(966)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther costs of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(360)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(302)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(290)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,273)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,256)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of Formula 1 revenue increased approximately $52 million and decreased $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Cost of Formula 1 revenue consists primarily of team payments.\nTeam payments decreased by $6 million and $47 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decreases were attributable to reductions in the variable elements of the Prize Fund which are calculated based on Formula 1's revenue and costs.\nOther costs of Formula 1 revenue include hospitality costs, which are principally related to catering and other aspects of the production and delivery of the Paddock Club, and circuit rights' fees payable under various agreements with race promoters to acquire certain commercial rights at Events, including the right to sell advertising, hospitality and support race opportunities. Other costs include annual Federation Internationale de l'Automobile regulatory fees, advertising and sponsorship commissions and those incurred in the provision and sale of freight, travel and logistical services, and GP3 cars, parts and maintenance services, television production and post-production services, advertising production services and digital and social media activities. These costs are largely variable in nature and relate directly to revenue opportunities. Other costs of Formula 1 revenue increased $58 million and $12 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase is primarily due to increased technical, logistics and travel, hospitality and Formula 2 and GP3 costs associated with the changes in the World Championship calendar, increased costs associated with sale of the new Formula 2 chassis and components to the competing Formula 2 teams during the first season of the latest three year Formula 2 cycle, costs associated with increased fan engagement activities, technical and digital media development and delivery and higher freight and hospitality costs. The prior year increase is due to increasing fan engagement activities, filming in Ultra High definition and higher freight,\nII-24\ndigital media and hospitality costs, partially offset by a lower circuit rights' fee under the contractual arrangements of one Event and the impact of one less Event in the year.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs, legal, professional and other advisory fees, bad debt expense, rental expense, information technology costs, non-Event-related travel costs, insurance premiums, maintenance and utility costs and other general office administration costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million and $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase was primarily driven by higher marketing and research costs and an increase in bad debt expense. The increases in pro forma selling, general and administrative expense during 2017 were primarily driven by higher personnel, property, marketing and research costs and advisory fees, all due to the acquisition by Liberty of Formula 1, partially offset by an improvement in foreign exchange related gains and lower bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nStock-based compensation expense relates to costs arising from grants of Series C Liberty Formula One common stock options and restricted stock units to members of Formula 1 management, subsequent to the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization was relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to pro forma depreciation and amortization in the corresponding period in the prior year. Pro forma depreciation and amortization increased $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nBraves Group\nBraves Holdings.\u2003Braves Holdings is our wholly owned subsidiary that indirectly owns and operates the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club and six minor league baseball clubs (the Gwinnett Stripers, the Mississippi Braves, the Rome Braves, the Danville Braves, the GCL Braves and the Dominican Summer League). Braves Holdings had exclusive operating rights to Turner Field, the home stadium of the Atlanta Braves, until December 31, 2016 pursuant to an Operating Agreement with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority. Effective for the 2017 season, the Braves relocated to a new ballpark in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta. The facility is leased from Cobb County and Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority and offers a range of activities and eateries for fans.

Baseball revenue is derived from three primary sources: ballpark operations (ticket sales, concessions, corporate sales, suites and premium seat fees), local and national broadcast rights, licensing and other shared Major League Baseball ( MLB\u201d) revenue streams. Development revenue is derived from the mixed-use facilities and primarily includes rental income. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue increased $56 million and $124 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Baseball revenue per game increased in 2018 due to ticket sales and concession revenue primarily due to increases in attendance driven by team performance, including post season revenue from the 2018 MLB playoffs. Development revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year as Braves Holdings had just begun renting the mixed-use facilities in 2017. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the move to the new stadium which increased the number of tickets sold, the average ticket price and concession revenue. Additionally, the new mixed-use development added revenue that Braves Holdings did not have in the previous year.\nOther operating expenses primarily include costs associated with baseball and stadium operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other operating expenses decreased $34 million and increased $57 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven by lower player salaries. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven primarily by increases in player costs and higher concession, parking and security costs associated with the new stadium.\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, finance and related personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $3 million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily driven by higher marketing costs in conjunction with the 2018 MLB playoffs and higher expenses related to the Development Project. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to costs incurred with the new stadium and the write-off of certain contractual rights related to international players.\nStock-based compensation decreased $36 million and increased $37 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 is due to vesting of outstanding awards in 2017, the start of a new plan period in 2018 and decreases in the fair value of the underlying awards. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in the value of Braves Holdings and vesting of outstanding awards.\nII-26\nDepreciation and amortization increased $9 million and $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 is due to an increase in depreciation related to the stadium, which was placed into service on March 21, 2017, partially offset by lower amortization expense related to international player contracts. The increase during 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in depreciation related to the stadium and an increase in property and equipment to support the Development Project.", "item_7_truncated": "Other Formula 1 revenue increased $39 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to pro forma Other Formula 1 revenue in the corresponding periods in the prior year.

Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.\nAdjusted OIBDA. We define Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses (excluding stock compensation), separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses, including each business's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nYears ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(actual)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(pro forma)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\namounts in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTeam payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(913)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(919)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(966)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther costs of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(360)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(302)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(290)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nCost of Formula 1 revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n(1,273)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,221)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(1,256)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments.

The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

If the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair value, we are required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statement of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from our long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value.

As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, $108 million of the settlement amount recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 was excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding period, as this expense was not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the period, and this lump sum amount did not relate to the on-going performance of the business. Subsequent to the settlement during June 2015, SIRIUS XM recognized $43 million and $40 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, that is included as a component of Adjusted OIBDA.\n\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations, excluding uncertain tax positions as it is indeterminable when payments will be made, is summarized below.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nII-6\nWe believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash.\n \u00b7 Revenue Share and Royalties (excluding legal settlements) includes distribution and content provider revenue share, royalties for transmitting content and web streaming, and advertising revenue share. Revenue share and royalties increased 14% and 10% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The increases during both years were primarily due to greater revenue subject to royalty and revenue sharing agreements and increases in the statutory royalty rate for the performance of sound recordings. During the second quarter of 2018, SIRIUS XM recorded a $69 million charge related to the legal settlement that resolved all outstanding claims, including ongoing audits, under SIRIUS XM's statutory license for sound recordings for the period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $45 and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. These expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business. \nStock-based compensation expense relates to costs arising from grants of Series C Liberty Formula One common stock options and restricted stock units to members of Formula 1 management, subsequent to the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nCost of subscriber services includes revenue share and royalties, programming and content costs, customer service and billing expenses and other ancillary costs associated with providing the satellite radio service.\nthe corresponding period in the prior year due to increased fees and growth in certain arrangements, partially offset by the non-renewal of two arrangements.\nII-14\nstatements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\n \u00b7 Customer Service and Billing includes costs associated with the operation and management of SIRIUS XM's internal and third party customer service centers and SIRIUS XM's subscriber management systems as well as billing and collection costs, transaction fees and bad debt expense. Customer service and billing expense decreased 1% and 1% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The current year decrease was primarily driven by lower call center costs due to lower agent rates, increased customer self-service resulting in lower contact rates and improved non-pay process driving lower bad debt expense, partially offset by increased transaction fees from a larger subscriber base and personnel-related costs. The prior year decrease was primarily due to a decline in call center agent rates and contact rates, partially offset by increased transaction fees based on a higher subscriber base. \nThe projected uses of Liberty cash (excluding SIRIUS XM's, Formula 1's and Braves Holdings' uses of cash) are primarily the investment in new or existing businesses, debt service, including potential repayment of the outstanding margin loan and the potential buyback of common stock under the approved share buyback program. Liberty expects to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and borrowing capacity under margin loans and outstanding credit facilities. We may be required to make net payments of income tax liabilities to settle items under discussion with tax authorities.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 5% and 13% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current year is driven by an increase in amortization expenses related to capitalized software additions and an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets placed in-service. The increase in the prior year was driven by the acceleration of amortization related to a shorter useful life of certain software as well as additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating results attributable to the Braves Holdings were as follows.\nStrategies and Challenges of Business Units\nOn September 7, 2016, Liberty, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Liberty GR Cayman Acquisition Company, entered into two definitive stock purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of Delta Topco, the parent company of Formula 1. The transactions contemplated by the first purchase agreement were completed on September 7, 2016, resulting in the acquisition of slightly less than a 20% minority stake in Formula 1 on an undiluted basis. On October 27, 2016 under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Liberty acquired an additional incremental equity interest of Delta Topco, maintaining Liberty's investment in Delta Topco on an undiluted basis and increasing slightly to 19.1% on a fully diluted basis. Liberty acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity interests of Delta Topco, other than a nominal number of shares held by certain Formula 1 teams, in a closing under the second purchase agreement (and following the unwind of the first purchase agreement) on January 23, 2017. See note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition. Liberty's acquired interest in Delta Topco and by extension Formula 1, along with existing Formula 1 cash and debt (which is non-recourse to Liberty), was attributed to the Formula One Group upon completion of the Second Closing. Formula 1 is a reportable segment.\nSIRIUS XM is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event SIRIUS XM were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty's management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and take appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty's management and its board of directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty's tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty's tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether. On February 1, 2019, SIRIUS XM acquired Pandora Media, Inc. ( Pandora\u201d). See note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the acquisition of Pandora.\nThe increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily attributable to higher logistics and digital media revenue, contributions from broadcasting in Ultra High Definition and higher hospitality revenue, partially offset by lower spend by GP3 series' competing teams during 2017 due to it being the second year of the GP3 vehicle cycle.\n\nFormula 1's operating results were as follows:\nAs discussed in note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on April 15, 2016, Liberty completed the Recapitalization. Upon completion of the Second Closing, as discussed below, the Liberty Media Group was renamed the Formula One Group. Although the Recapitalization was not effective for all periods presented herein, information has been presented among the tracking stock groups for all periods presented as if the Recapitalization had been completed for all periods presented. This attribution of historical financial information does not purport to be what actual results and balances would have been if the Recapitalization had actually occurred and been in place during the periods prior to April 15, 2016. Operating results prior to the Recapitalization are attributed to Liberty stockholders in the aggregate.\nOther revenue includes advertising revenue, equipment revenue, royalty revenue and other ancillary revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other revenue increased 24% and 16%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by higher U.S. music royalty fee revenue due to a higher rate and an increase in the number of subscribers and higher revenue generated from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and SIRIUS XM Canada. In addition, equipment revenue increased due to additional royalty revenue due to SIRIUS XM's transition to a new generation of chipsets. The prior year increase was driven by higher revenue from Sirius XM Canada due to the new Services Agreement and Advisory Services Agreement entered into in the second quarter of 2017, additional revenue from the U.S. Music Royalty Fee due to an increase in the number of subscribers and subscribers paying at a higher rate and higher revenue generated from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services. Equipment revenue increased during the prior year driven by royalty revenue on certain satellite radio components starting in the second quarter of 2016 due to SIRIUS XM's transition to a new generation of chipsets and revenue from the sales of connected vehicle devices since the acquisition of Automatic, partially offset by lower revenue generated through satellite radio sales to distributors and consumers and lower OEM production. Advertising revenue increased during both periods due to a greater number of advertising spots sold and transmitted along with increased rates charged per spot.\nFormula One Group\nWe own controlling and non-controlling interests in a broad range of media and entertainment companies. Our most significant operating subsidiary, which is a reportable segment, is Sirius XM Holdings Inc. ( SIRIUS XM\u201d). SIRIUS XM provides a subscription based satellite radio service. SIRIUS XM also transmits a larger set of music and other channels through SIRIUS XM's streaming service. SIRIUS XM's streaming services is available online and through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nResults of Operations-Businesses\n\n \u00b7 acquisitions and investments, including acquisitions and investments that are not directly related to its satellite radio business. \nFormula 1. Formula 1 is a global motorsports business that holds exclusive commercial rights with respect to the World Championship, an annual, approximately nine-month long, motor race-based competition in which teams compete for the Constructors' Championship and drivers compete for the Drivers' Championship. The World Championship takes place on various circuits with various Events. Formula 1 is responsible for the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship. Formula 1 derives its primary revenue from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of entering into race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship arrangements. A significant majority of the race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship contracts specify payments in advance and annual increases in the fees payable over the course of the contracts.\nII-17\nII-9\nII-24\nSIRIUS XM's primary uses of cash were the repurchase of outstanding SIRIUS XM common stock, dividends paid to stockholders and additions to property and equipment resulting from new satellite construction. The SIRIUS XM uses of cash were funded by cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and borrowings of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2018, SIRIUS XM declared a cash dividend each quarter, and paid in cash an aggregate amount of $201 million, of which Liberty received $143 million. SIRIUS XM's board of directors expects to declare regular quarterly dividends, in an aggregate annual amount of $0.0484 per share of common stock. On January 29, 2019, SIRIUS XM's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock in the amount of $0.0121 per share of common stock, payable on February 28, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2019.\nFormula 1's primary use of cash was the net repayment of debt.\nOther operating expenses primarily include costs associated with baseball and stadium operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other operating expenses decreased $34 million and increased $57 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven by lower player salaries. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven primarily by increases in player costs and higher concession, parking and security costs associated with the new stadium.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, an equity method affiliate of Braves Holdings sold a controlling interest in a subsidiary, resulting in Braves Holdings recording its portion of the gain of $69 million.\n \u00b7 capturing opportunities created by media's evolution, including the growth of social media and the development of Formula 1's digital media assets; \nSIRIUS XM faces certain key challenges in its attempt to meet these goals, including:\nII-18\n\n \u00b7 working with stakeholders within the sport to improve the sustainability and on-track competitive balance of the World Championship and the long term financial stability of the participating Teams. \nII-19\nII-20\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes a consolidated subsidiary, Braves Holdings, LLC ( Braves Holdings\u201d) and corporate expenses. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. ( Live Nation\u201d), which is accounted for as an equity method investment at December 31, 2018 and is included in corporate and other. We also maintain minority positions in other public companies.\nSubscriber revenue includes subscription, activation and other fees. Subscriber revenue increased 3% and 7% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a 5% increase in the daily weighted average number of subscribers, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related amendments, which established Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ( ASC 606\u201d), effective as of January 1, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a 4% increase in the daily weighted average number of subscribers as well as a 3% increase in SIRIUS XM's average monthly revenue per subscriber resulting from certain rate increases.\n \u00b7 continuing to seek and identify opportunities to expand and develop the Event calendar and bring Events to attractive and/or strategically important new markets outside of Europe, which typically have higher race promotion fees, while continuing to build on the foundation of the sport in Europe; \nDepreciation and amortization increased $9 million and $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 is due to an increase in depreciation related to the stadium, which was placed into service on March 21, 2017, partially offset by lower amortization expense related to international player contracts. The increase during 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in depreciation related to the stadium and an increase in property and equipment to support the Development Project.\nSIRIUS XM's primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of its customers subscribing to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans. SIRIUS XM offers discounts for prepaid subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount. SIRIUS XM also derives revenue from certain fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories and other ancillary services, such as weather, data and traffic services. SIRIUS XM provides traffic services to approximately 8.6 million vehicles.\n\nII-10\nyear, partially offset by approximately $18 million in dividend and interest income, primarily due to dividends on Time Warner, Inc. shares.\nCost of Formula 1 revenue increased approximately $52 million and decreased $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Cost of Formula 1 revenue consists primarily of team payments.\nSubscriber acquisition costs include hardware subsidies paid to radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers, including subsidies paid for chipsets and certain other components used in manufacturing radios; device royalties for certain radios and chipsets; product warranty obligations; and freight. The majority of subscriber acquisition costs are incurred and expensed in advance of, or concurrent with, acquiring a subscriber. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, subscriber acquisition costs decreased 6% and 3%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in\nLiberty acquired a controlling interest in Formula 1 on January 23, 2017 and applied acquisition accounting and consolidated the results of Formula 1 from that date. Prior to the acquisition of our controlling interest, we maintained an investment in Formula 1 since September 7, 2016, which was accounted for as a cost method investment. Although Formula 1's results are only included in Liberty's results since January 23, 2017, we believe a discussion of Formula 1's results for all periods presented promotes a better understanding of the overall results of its business. For comparison and discussion purposes, we are presenting the pro forma results of Formula 1 for the full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, inclusive of acquisition accounting adjustments. The pro forma financial information was prepared based on the historical financial information of Formula 1 and assuming the acquisition of Formula 1 took place on January 1, 2016. The pro forma adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing comparative pro forma financial\ndigital media and hospitality costs, partially offset by a lower circuit rights' fee under the contractual arrangements of one Event and the impact of one less Event in the year.\nII-26\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. All of these accounting estimates and assumptions, as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements, have been discussed with our audit committee.\nOther operating expense includes engineering, design and development costs consisting primarily of compensation and related costs to develop chipsets and new products and services. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other operating expense increased 9% and 41%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase was driven by the continued development of SIRIUS XM's streaming product and connected vehicle services. The prior year increase was driven by the development of SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and additional costs associated with the development of SIRIUS XM's audio and video streaming products.\nThe term Braves Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Braves Group is primarily comprised of Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club ( ANLBC,\u201d the Braves,\u201d or the Atlanta Braves\u201d) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC's stadium and mixed use development project (the Development Project\u201d) and corporate cash. As of December 31, 2018, the Braves Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $107 million, which includes $40 million of subsidiary cash. Additionally, as discussed below, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group. See note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering.\nSIRIUS XM has agreements with every major automaker ( OEMs\u201d) to offer satellite radio in their vehicles, through which it acquires the majority of its subscribers. SIRIUS XM also acquires subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to SIRIUS XM's services. SIRIUS XM distributes its radios primarily through automakers, retailers and its website. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies.\n\nII-8\nSIRIUS XM's satellites have been designed to last fifteen-years. SIRIUS XM's in-orbit satellites may experience component failures which could adversely affect their useful lives. SIRIUS XM monitors the operating condition of its in-orbit satellites. If events or circumstances indicate that the depreciable lives of its in-orbit satellites have changed, the\nAs of December 31, 2018, substantially all of our cash and cash equivalents are invested in U.S. Treasury securities, other government securities or government guaranteed funds, AAA rated money market funds and other highly rated financial and corporate debt instruments.\n \u00b7 During 2018, our effective tax rate was lower than the federal tax rate of 21% U.S. due to deductible stock-based compensation, benefits related to federal tax credits and the resolution of historical matters with various tax authorities, partially offset by changes in the valuation allowance and taxable dividends not recognized for book purposes. \nThe term Formula One Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. As of December 31, 2018, the Formula One Group (formerly the Liberty Media Group) is primarily comprised of all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Braves Group, including Liberty's interests in Formula 1 and Live Nation, Liberty's 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty's 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023, Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046 and Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048. Following the creation of the tracking stocks and the closing of the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group of approximately 15.1%, valued at $226 million, as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Formula One Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $160 million, which includes $30 million of subsidiary cash.\nOverview\n (2) Amounts (i) are based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2018, (ii) assume the interest rates on our variable rate debt remain constant at the December 31, 2018 rates and (iii) assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity. \nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income increased $117 million and decreased $340 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Operating losses decreased $114 million and operating income increased $73 million for Braves Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, and operating losses increased $70 million for Formula One Group during 2018 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in corporate and other operating losses for Formula One Group for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by costs related to the acquisition of Formula 1 recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. Formula One Group operating income decreased $483 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the favorable one-time net $511 million Vivendi lawsuit settlement during the first quarter of 2016, as discussed in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $195 million and Braves Group operating loss increased $52 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nTo the extent the Company recognizes any taxable gains from the sale of assets we may incur tax expense and be required to make tax payments, thereby reducing any cash proceeds. Additionally, the Company has a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM which has significant cash flows provided by operating activities, although due to SIRIUS XM being a separate public company and the significant noncontrolling interest, we do not have ready access to its cash. Cash held by Formula 1 is accessible by Liberty, except when certain restricted payment tests imposed by the Senior Loan Facility at Formula 1 are not met. As of December 31, 2018, Liberty had $750 million available under a $1.35 billion margin loan due 2020 and $600 million available under the Live Nation Margin Loan. Certain tax consequences may reduce the net amount of cash that Liberty is able to utilize for corporate purposes. Liberty believes that it currently has appropriate legal structures in place to repatriate foreign cash as tax efficiently as possible and meet the business needs of the Company.\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, finance and related personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $3 million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily driven by higher marketing costs in conjunction with the 2018 MLB playoffs and higher expenses related to the Development Project. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to costs incurred with the new stadium and the write-off of certain contractual rights related to international players.\nUseful Life of Broadcast/Transmission System. SIRIUS XM's satellite system includes the costs of satellite construction, launch vehicles, launch insurance, capitalized interest, spare satellites, terrestrial repeater network and satellite uplink facilities. SIRIUS XM monitors its satellites for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable.\n \u00b7 During 2017, in connection with the initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), as discussed in note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a discrete net tax benefit, primarily driven by the corporate tax rate reduction. \nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by the operating activities of our privately-owned subsidiaries (to the extent such cash exceeds the working capital needs of the subsidiaries and is not otherwise restricted), proceeds from net asset sales, monetization of our public investment portfolio, debt and equity issuances, available borrowing capacity under margin loans, and dividend and interest receipts.\nLiberty's primary uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018 (excluding cash used by SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings) were $466 million of Series C Liberty SiriusXM common stock repurchases and $414 million of investments in equity method affiliates and debt and equity securities. These uses were funded by borrowings of debt and cash on hand.\nIncome taxes. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was an expense of 17%, benefit of 129% and expense of 35%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for all three years was impacted for the following reasons:\nFormula 1's uses of cash are expected to be debt service payments, as well as continued investment in its business. Liberty expects Formula 1 to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and cash provided by operations.\nWe acquired a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM on January 18, 2013 and applied purchase accounting and consolidated the results of SIRIUS XM from that date. The results presented for SIRIUS XM below include the impacts of acquisition accounting adjustments in all periods presented. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, there is an approximate 27% noncontrolling interest in SIRIUS XM, and the net earnings of SIRIUS XM attributable to such noncontrolling interest is eliminated through the noncontrolling interest line item in the consolidated statement of\n \u00b7 unfavorable changes in legislation. \nAs of December 31, 2018, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our significant reporting units were as follows (amounts in millions):\nOther costs of Formula 1 revenue include hospitality costs, which are principally related to catering and other aspects of the production and delivery of the Paddock Club, and circuit rights' fees payable under various agreements with race promoters to acquire certain commercial rights at Events, including the right to sell advertising, hospitality and support race opportunities. Other costs include annual Federation Internationale de l'Automobile regulatory fees, advertising and sponsorship commissions and those incurred in the provision and sale of freight, travel and logistical services, and GP3 cars, parts and maintenance services, television production and post-production services, advertising production services and digital and social media activities. These costs are largely variable in nature and relate directly to revenue opportunities. Other costs of Formula 1 revenue increased $58 million and $12 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase is primarily due to increased technical, logistics and travel, hospitality and Formula 2 and GP3 costs associated with the changes in the World Championship calendar, increased costs associated with sale of the new Formula 2 chassis and components to the competing Formula 2 teams during the first season of the latest three year Formula 2 cycle, costs associated with increased fan engagement activities, technical and digital media development and delivery and higher freight and hospitality costs. The prior year increase is due to increasing fan engagement activities, filming in Ultra High definition and higher freight,\nOther Formula 1 revenue is generated from miscellaneous and ancillary sources primarily related to administering the shipment of cars and equipment to and from events outside of Europe, revenue from the sale of tickets to the Formula One Paddock Club at most Events, support races at Events (either from the direct operation of the and GP3 series (the latter of which will be replaced in 2019 by the series) or from the licensing of other third party series or individual race events), various television production and post-production activities, digital and social media services and other ancillary operations.\n (1) Amounts are stated at the face amount at maturity of our debt instruments and may differ from the amounts stated in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent debt instruments (i) were issued at a discount or premium or (ii) have elements which are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts include capital lease obligations. Amounts do not assume additional borrowings or refinancings of existing debt. \n \u00b7 significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; \nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $184 million and $720 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2018 as compared to the prior year was due to increases of $120 million and $86 million in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA, respectively, partially offset by a $22 million decrease in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to increases of $442 million in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA, Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $256 million and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $22 million. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nNet earnings. We had net earnings of $865 million, $1,890 million and $924 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in net earnings was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\n \u00b7 investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and \n \u00b7 During 2016, our effective tax rate was equal to the federal tax rate of 35% due to the offsetting impact of state income taxes and federal tax credits claimed by SIRIUS XM. \nA tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or track\u201d the economic performance of a particular business or group,\u201d rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Liberty Braves Group (the Braves Group\u201d) and Formula One Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Formula One Group. Holders of tracking stock\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization was relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to pro forma depreciation and amortization in the corresponding period in the prior year. Pro forma depreciation and amortization increased $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nStock-based compensation decreased $36 million and increased $37 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 is due to vesting of outstanding awards in 2017, the start of a new plan period in 2018 and decreases in the fair value of the underlying awards. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in the value of Braves Holdings and vesting of outstanding awards.\nII-25\nTeam payments decreased by $6 million and $47 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decreases were attributable to reductions in the variable elements of the Prize Fund which are calculated based on Formula 1's revenue and costs.\n \u00b7 the effectiveness of integration of acquired businesses and assets into its operations; \nRevenue. Our consolidated revenue increased $446 million and $2,318 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The 2018 increase was driven by revenue growth at SIRIUS XM, Braves Holdings and Formula 1 of $346 million, $56 million and $44 million, respectively. The 2017 increase was primarily driven by $1,783 million of Formula 1 revenue, as a result of the Company's acquisition of Formula 1 on January 23, 2017, and revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $411 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $124 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\n \u00b7 Programming and Content includes costs to acquire, create, promote and produce content. Programming and content costs increased 5% and 8% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by increased personnel-related costs and higher music licensing costs. The prior year increase was due to the addition of video content rights, the payment for which started during the third quarter of 2016, as well as increased talent and personnel related costs. \nThe prior year decrease was due to one less Event during 2017 compared to 2016 and legacy contractual terms of one Event, which provided a one time significant decrease in race promotion fees after the 2016 season through the remaining term of that contract. These decreases in race promotion revenue were partially offset by the impact of other contractual increases. Broadcasting revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the impact of certain contractual rate increases, partially offset by the net adverse impact of weaker prevailing foreign currency exchange rates used to translate a small number of fees that were not denominated in U.S. Dollars. Advertising and sponsorship revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to\n \u00b7 potential loss of subscribers due to economic conditions and competition from other entertainment providers; \nII-11\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther, net. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to a $48 million decrease in losses on early extinguishment of debt and a $17 million increase in gains on transactions, primarily driven by the sale of the residential portion of Braves Holdings' mixed-use complex. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a $19 million increase in interest and dividend income and a $12 million increase in gains on transactions, partially offset by a $24 million increase in losses on early extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the redemption of certain debt at SIRIUS XM. The loss in 2016 was primarily due to a $24 million loss on extinguishment of SIRIUS XM's redemption of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 during the\nBraves Holdings. Braves Holdings is our wholly owned subsidiary that indirectly owns and operates the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club and six minor league baseball clubs (the Gwinnett Stripers, the Mississippi Braves, the Rome Braves, the Danville Braves, the GCL Braves and the Dominican Summer League). Braves Holdings had exclusive operating rights to Turner Field, the home stadium of the Atlanta Braves, until December 31, 2016 pursuant to an Operating Agreement with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority. Effective for the 2017 season, the Braves relocated to a new ballpark in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta. The facility is leased from Cobb County and Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority and offers a range of activities and eateries for fans. Braves Holdings and its affiliates participated in the construction of the new stadium and are participating in the construction of an adjacent mixed-use development project, which we refer to as the Development Project.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have entered into long-term employment contracts with certain of their players and coaches whereby such individuals' compensation is guaranteed. Amounts due under guaranteed contracts as of December 31, 2018 aggregated $165 million. See the table below for more detail. In addition to the foregoing amounts, certain players and coaches may earn incentive compensation under the terms of their employment contracts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \u00b7 Other includes costs associated with the operation and maintenance of SIRIUS XM's terrestrial repeater networks; satellites; satellite telemetry, tracking and control systems; satellite uplink facilities; studios; and delivery of SIRIUS XM's streaming service and connected vehicle services as well as costs from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories and provisions for inventory allowance attributable to products purchased for resale in SIRIUS XM's direct to consumer distribution channels. Other costs of subscriber services increased 8% and decreased 19% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The current year increase was primarily driven by higher wireless costs associated with SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and higher streaming costs, partially offset by lower direct satellite radio sales to consumers. The prior year decrease was driven by lower wireless costs associated with SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services, a reduction in terrestrial repeater costs as a result of the elimination of duplicative repeater sites, and lower sales to distributors and consumers, partially offset by increased streaming costs and the incremental costs associated with the sale of connected vehicle devices since the acquisition of Automatic. \nChanges in unrealized gains (losses) on debt measured at fair value are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable.\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates. The following table presents our share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\nSIRIUS XM operates three in-orbit XM satellites, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5. SIRIUS XM estimates that its XM-3 and XM-4 satellites launched in 2005 and 2006, respectively, will reach the end of their depreciable lives in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The XM-5 satellite that was launched in 2010, is used as an in-orbit spare for the Sirius and XM systems and is expected to reach the end of its depreciable life in 2025.\nWe recorded $192 million, $230 million and $150 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in stock compensation expense in 2018 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to decreases of $36 million and $8 million at Braves Holdings and Formula 1, respectively, partially offset by increases of $9 million at SIRIUS XM. The increase in stock compensation expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases of $37 million at Braves Holdings, $23 million at Formula 1 and $15 million at SIRIUS XM.\nComponents of Other Income (Expense) are presented in the table below.\nare also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.\nII-16\nII-15\n\nBraves Group\nII-23\nII-13\nResults of Operations-Consolidated\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to (1) options and stock appreciation rights for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees, (2) phantom stock appreciation rights granted to officers and employees of certain of our subsidiaries pursuant to private equity plans and (3) amortization of restricted stock grants.\nLiberty SiriusXM Group\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs, legal, professional and other advisory fees, bad debt expense, rental expense, information technology costs, non-Event-related travel costs, insurance premiums, maintenance and utility costs and other general office administration costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million and $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase was primarily driven by higher marketing and research costs and an increase in bad debt expense. The increases in pro forma selling, general and administrative expense during 2017 were primarily driven by higher personnel, property, marketing and research costs and advisory fees, all due to the acquisition by Liberty of Formula 1, partially offset by an improvement in foreign exchange related gains and lower bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nRevenue includes amounts generated from Braves Holdings' baseball and development operations. Baseball revenue is derived from three primary sources: ballpark operations (ticket sales, concessions, corporate sales, suites and premium seat fees), local and national broadcast rights, licensing and other shared Major League Baseball ( MLB\u201d) revenue streams. Development revenue is derived from the mixed-use facilities and primarily includes rental income. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue increased $56 million and $124 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Baseball revenue per game increased in 2018 due to ticket sales and concession revenue primarily due to increases in attendance driven by team performance, including post season revenue from the 2018 MLB playoffs. Development revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year as Braves Holdings had just begun renting the mixed-use facilities in 2017. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the move to the new stadium which increased the number of tickets sold, the average ticket price and concession revenue. Additionally, the new mixed-use development added revenue that Braves Holdings did not have in the previous year.\nBraves Holdings' uses of cash are expected to be expenditures related to the mixed-use development and new spring training facility. Liberty expects Braves Holdings to fund its projected uses of cash with borrowings under its existing debt instruments, cash provided by operations and through the issuance of new construction loans for Phase II. See Item 1. Business - (c) Narrative Description of Business - Braves Holdings, LLC - Mixed-use development.\nII-22\nII-12\nSIRIUS XM's uses of cash are expected to be operating expenses, capital expenditures, including the construction of replacement satellites, working capital requirements, interest payments, taxes and scheduled maturities of outstanding debt. Liberty expects SIRIUS XM to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash provided by operations and borrowings under the existing credit facility.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nSIRIUS XM operates two in-orbit Sirius satellites, FM-5 and FM-6. SIRIUS XM estimates that its FM-5 and FM-6 satellites, launched in 2009 and 2013, respectively, will operate effectively through the end of their depreciable lives in 2024 and 2028, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nInterest expense. Consolidated interest expense increased $15 million and $229 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for 2018 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the average amount of corporate and subsidiary debt outstanding during the current period for Liberty SiriusXM Group and the capitalization of interest related to construction of the stadium and mixed-use facilities during the prior period for Braves Group, partially offset by decreases in interest expense for the Formula One Group due to decreases in the average amount of corporate and subsidiary debt outstanding. The increase in 2017 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately $167 million of interest expense attributable to debt held at Formula 1, which we began consolidating on January 23, 2017 when we acquired Formula 1. The remaining increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the average amount of corporate, SIRIUS XM and other subsidiary debt outstanding.\n \u00b7 competition for both listeners and advertisers, including providers of radio and other audio services; \nII-7\n \u00b7 the operational performance of its satellites; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, media and production, including promotional events and sponsorships; cooperative marketing; compensation and related personnel costs; facilities costs, finance, legal, human resources and information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 9% and 6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases for both years were due to additional subscriber communications, retention programs and acquisition campaigns as well as higher personnel-related costs. Additional increases during the year ended December 31, 2018 were driven by higher information technology costs, a one-time charge for sales and use taxes and expenses associated with the Pandora acquisition. The increases during the year ended December 31, 2017 were partially offset by the timing of certain OEM marketing campaigns, lower legal costs, litigation reserves and consulting costs.\nThe increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by an increase in race promotion fees due to contractual increases in fees for certain Events and increased economics from contractual arrangements at one Event (which was fully offset by a decrease in advertising and sponsorship revenue, as discussed below). In addition, broadcasting revenue increased during the current period as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates used to translate Great Britain Pound and Euro-denominated contracts into U.S. Dollars and the impact of certain contractual rate increases, partially offset by the early termination of one contract with a failing broadcast rights holder. Advertising and sponsorship revenue decreased during the current period as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to revised contractual arrangements at one Event and non-renewal of another small sponsorship arrangement, partially offset by revenue from new contracts and increases in existing contracts.\n", "item_7_text": "Other Formula 1 revenue increased $39 million and $7 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to pro forma Other Formula 1 revenue in the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current year was primarily attributable increases in revenue from the sale of the new chassis, engine and other components to the series' competing teams due to 2018 being the first year of the vehicle cycle, higher logistical and travel services revenue, higher digital media and television production related revenue and increased revenue from hospitality and various fan engagement and other event based activities.\ninformation. The financial information below is presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent the actual results of operations of Formula 1 had the business combination occurred on January 1, 2016, or to project the results of operations of Liberty for any future periods. The pro forma adjustments are based on available information and certain assumptions that Liberty management believes are reasonable. The pro forma adjustments are directly attributable to the business combination and are expected to have a continuing impact on the results of operations of Liberty.\nthe prior year. The decreases for both years were driven by reductions to OEM hardware subsidy rates, lower subsidized costs related to the transition of chipsets and decreases in satellite radio installations.\nIncome Taxes. We are required to estimate the amount of tax payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make judgments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact of the various agreements and transactions that we enter into. Based on these judgments we may record tax reserves or adjustments to valuation allowances on deferred tax assets to reflect the expected realizability of future tax benefits. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each year's liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position.\nAdjusted OIBDA. We define Adjusted OIBDA as revenue less operating expenses and selling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses (excluding stock compensation), separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges. Our chief operating decision maker and management team use this measure of performance in conjunction with other measures to evaluate our businesses and make decisions about allocating resources among our businesses. We believe this is an important indicator of the operational strength and performance of our businesses, including each business's ability to service debt and fund capital expenditures. In addition, this measure allows us to view operating results, perform analytical comparisons and benchmarking between businesses and identify strategies to improve performance. This measure of performance excludes such costs as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, separately reported litigation settlements and restructuring and impairment charges that are included in the measurement of operating income pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d). Accordingly, Adjusted OIBDA should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, operating income, net income, cash flow provided by operating activities and other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. See note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to Operating income (loss) and Earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments. Realized and unrealized gains (losses) on financial instruments are comprised of changes in the fair value of the following:\n \u00b7 its ability to convince owners and lessees of new and previously owned vehicles that include satellite radios to purchase subscriptions to its service; \nSIRIUS XM SIRIUS XM transmits its music, sports, entertainment, comedy, talk, news, traffic and weather channels, as well as infotainment services, in the United States on a subscription fee basis through its two proprietary satellite radio systems. SIRIUS XM also transmits a larger set of music and other channels through SIRIUS XM's streaming service. SIRIUS XM's streaming services is available online and through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nThe World Championship calendar consisted of 21 Events, 20 Events and 21 Events during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n \u00b7 the performance of its manufacturers, programming providers, vendors, and retailers; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested Liberty equity awards was approximately $22 million. Such amount will be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.3 years. As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested SIRIUS XM stock options and restricted stock units was $254 million. The SIRIUS XM unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized in the Company's consolidated statements of operations over a weighted average period of approximately 1.8 years.\nWe perform our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangible assets in the fourth quarter each year. The accounting guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. The accounting guidance also allows entities the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. In evaluating goodwill on a qualitative basis, the Company reviews the business performance of each reporting unit and evaluates other relevant factors as identified in the relevant accounting guidance to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indicated impairment exists for any of our reporting units. The Company considers whether there are any negative macroeconomic conditions, industry specific conditions, market changes, increased competition, increased costs in doing business, management challenges, the legal environments and how these factors might impact company specific performance in future periods. As part of the analysis, the Company also considers fair value determinations for certain reporting units that have been made at various points throughout the current and prior year for other purposes. If based on the qualitative analysis it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, the Company performs the quantitative impairment test.\n \u00b7 the acquisition and pricing of unique or compelling programming; \n \u00b7 developing advertising and sponsorship revenue, including increasing sales of Event-based packages and under the Global Partner program, and exploring opportunities in underexploited product categories; \nNon-Financial Instruments.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, SIRIUS XM recorded a one-time benefit to stock-based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of ASU 2018-07, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This benefit was more than offset by an increase in stock-based compensation expense due to an increase in the number of awards granted. The increase in the prior year is primarily due to an increase in the number of awards granted.\n\n (4) Includes amounts due related to the Braves Holdings baseball stadium and mixed-use development and SIRIUS XM satellite and transmission, marketing and distribution, satellite incentive payments, and other contractual commitments. SIRIUS XM satellite and transmission commitments are attributable to agreements with third parties to operate and maintain the off-site satellite telemetry, tracking and control facilities and certain components of its terrestrial repeater networks. During the year ended December 31, 2016, SIRIUS XM entered into an agreement with Space Systems/Loral to design and build two satellites, SXM-7 and SXM-8, for SIRIUS XM's service. SIRIUS XM marketing and distribution commitments primarily relate to payments to sponsors, retailers, automakers and radio manufacturers pursuant to marketing, sponsorship and distribution agreements to promote the SIRIUS XM brand. Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. and Space Systems/Loral, the manufacturers of SIRIUS XM's in-orbit satellites, may be entitled to future in-orbit satellite incentive performance payments based on the expected operating performance of the satellites meeting their fifteen-year design life. Boeing may also be entitled to an additional $10 million if the XM-4 satellite continues to operate above baseline specifications during the five years beyond the satellite's fifteen-year design life. Additionally, SIRIUS XM has entered into various agreements with third parties for general operating purposes. \nPrimary Formula 1 revenue is derived from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of race promotion fees (earned from granting the rights to host, stage and promote each Event on the World Championship calendar), broadcasting fees (earned from licensing the right to broadcast Events on television and other platforms, including the internet) and advertising and sponsorship fees (earned from the sale of World Championship and Event-related advertising and sponsorship rights).\n\nSIRIUS XM has entered into various programming agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, SIRIUS XM's obligations include fixed payments, advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements. SIRIUS XM's future revenue sharing costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to estimate; therefore, they are not included in the schedule of contractual obligations below.\nGeneral. We provide in the tables below information regarding our Consolidated Operating Results and Other Income and Expense, as well as information regarding the contribution to those items from our reportable segments. The corporate and other\u201d category consists of those assets or businesses which do not qualify as a separate reportable segment.

At the same time, Liberty entered into a bond hedge transaction on the same amount of underlying shares. These derivatives are marked to fair value on a recurring basis. The primary driver of the change in the fair value of bond hedges is the change in the fair value of the underlying stock.\nThe changes in unrealized gains (losses) on debt and equity securities (as defined in note 3 of our accompanying consolidated financial statements) are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the stock underlying these financial instruments.\nAs of December 31, 2018, Liberty's cash and cash equivalents and unencumbered marketable equity securities were as follows:\noperations.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. See note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an overview of accounting standards that we have adopted or that we plan to adopt that have had or may have an impact on our financial statements.\nSIRIUS XM. SIRIUS XM is focused on several initiatives to increase its revenue. SIRIUS XM regularly evaluates its business plans and strategy. Currently, its strategies include:\nSIRIUS XM's operating results were as follows:\nThe cash provided (used) by our continuing operations for the prior three years is as follows:\n (3) SIRIUS XM has entered into various programming agreements under which SIRIUS XM's obligations include fixed payments, advertising commitments and revenue sharing arrangements. Future revenue sharing costs are dependent upon many factors and are difficult to estimate; therefore, they are not included in the table above. In addition, SIRIUS XM has entered into certain music royalty arrangements that include fixed payments. \nDuring the second quarter of 2018 and during the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $69 million, $45 million and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the $69 million, $45 million and $46 million of expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties expense line item in the accompanying consolidated financial\nAs of December 31, 2018, SIRIUS XM had approximately 34.0 million subscribers of which approximately 28.9 million were self-pay subscribers and approximately 5.1 million were paid promotional subscribers. These subscriber totals include subscribers under regular pricing plans; discounted pricing plans; subscribers that have prepaid, including payments either made or due from automakers for subscriptions included in the sale or lease price of a vehicle; subscribers to SIRIUS XM's streaming services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions; and certain subscribers to SIRIUS XM's weather, traffic and data services who do not also have satellite radio subscriptions. Subscribers and subscription related revenue and expenses associated with the SIRIUS XM Canada service, which had approximately 2.6 million subscribers as of December 31, 2018, and SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services are not included in SIRIUS XM's subscriber count or subscriber-based operating metrics.\ncombinations, our annual assessment of the recoverability of our goodwill and other nonamortizable intangibles, such as trademarks, and our evaluation of the recoverability of our other long-lived assets upon certain triggering events. If the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceeds their estimated fair value, we are required to write the carrying value down to fair value. Any such writedown is included in impairment of long-lived assets in our consolidated statement of operations. A high degree of judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long-lived assets. We may use quoted market prices, prices for similar assets, present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates. We may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to implement these valuation techniques. Due to the high degree of judgment involved in our estimation techniques, any value ultimately derived from our long-lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value. As each of our operating segments has long-lived assets, this critical accounting policy affects the financial position and results of operations of each segment.\n \u00b7 the development and introduction of new features or services; \nThe term Liberty SiriusXM Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Liberty SiriusXM Group is primarily comprised of Liberty's subsidiary, SIRIUS XM, corporate cash, investments in debt securities, Liberty's 2.125% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048 and a margin loan obligation incurred by a wholly-owned special purpose subsidiary of Liberty. As of December 31, 2018, the Liberty SiriusXM Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $91 million, which includes $54 million of subsidiary cash.\nFormula 1. Formula 1's goal is to further broaden and increase the global scale and appeal of the FIA Formula One World Championship (the World Championship\u201d) in order to improve the overall value of Formula 1 as a sport and its financial performance. Key factors of this strategy include:\nOther Income and Expense\nLiberty currently does not have a corporate debt rating.\nSIRIUS XM recognized approximately $43 million and $40 million of Revenue share and royalties within the consolidated statement of operations during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related to the SIRIUS XM legal settlement associated with SIRIUS XM's use of certain pre-1972 sound recordings. As separately reported in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, $108 million of the settlement amount recognized during the year ended December 31, 2015 was excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding period, as this expense was not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the period, and this lump sum amount did not relate to the on-going performance of the business. Subsequent to the settlement during June 2015, SIRIUS XM recognized $43 million and $40 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively, that is included as a component of Adjusted OIBDA.\n\nInformation concerning the amount and timing of required payments, both accrued and off-balance sheet, under our contractual obligations, excluding uncertain tax positions as it is indeterminable when payments will be made, is summarized below.\nSee Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nII-6\nWe believe that the available sources of liquidity are sufficient to cover our projected future uses of cash.\n \u00b7 Revenue Share and Royalties (excluding legal settlements) includes distribution and content provider revenue share, royalties for transmitting content and web streaming, and advertising revenue share. Revenue share and royalties increased 14% and 10% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the prior year periods. The increases during both years were primarily due to greater revenue subject to royalty and revenue sharing agreements and increases in the statutory royalty rate for the performance of sound recordings. During the second quarter of 2018, SIRIUS XM recorded a $69 million charge related to the legal settlement that resolved all outstanding claims, including ongoing audits, under SIRIUS XM's statutory license for sound recordings for the period January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarters of 2017 and 2016, SIRIUS XM recorded $45 and $46 million, respectively, related to music royalty legal settlements and reserves. These expenses are included in the Revenue share and royalties line item in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business. \nStock-based compensation expense relates to costs arising from grants of Series C Liberty Formula One common stock options and restricted stock units to members of Formula 1 management, subsequent to the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nCost of subscriber services includes revenue share and royalties, programming and content costs, customer service and billing expenses and other ancillary costs associated with providing the satellite radio service.\nthe corresponding period in the prior year due to increased fees and growth in certain arrangements, partially offset by the non-renewal of two arrangements.\nII-14\nstatements for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, but have been excluded from Adjusted OIBDA for the corresponding periods as these expenses were not incurred as a part of SIRIUS XM's normal operations for the periods, and these lump sum amounts do not relate to the on-going performance of the business.\n \u00b7 Customer Service and Billing includes costs associated with the operation and management of SIRIUS XM's internal and third party customer service centers and SIRIUS XM's subscriber management systems as well as billing and collection costs, transaction fees and bad debt expense. Customer service and billing expense decreased 1% and 1% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The current year decrease was primarily driven by lower call center costs due to lower agent rates, increased customer self-service resulting in lower contact rates and improved non-pay process driving lower bad debt expense, partially offset by increased transaction fees from a larger subscriber base and personnel-related costs. The prior year decrease was primarily due to a decline in call center agent rates and contact rates, partially offset by increased transaction fees based on a higher subscriber base. \nThe projected uses of Liberty cash (excluding SIRIUS XM's, Formula 1's and Braves Holdings' uses of cash) are primarily the investment in new or existing businesses, debt service, including potential repayment of the outstanding margin loan and the potential buyback of common stock under the approved share buyback program. Liberty expects to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and borrowing capacity under margin loans and outstanding credit facilities. We may be required to make net payments of income tax liabilities to settle items under discussion with tax authorities.\nDepreciation and amortization increased 5% and 13% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The increase in the current year is driven by an increase in amortization expenses related to capitalized software additions and an increase in depreciation expense due to additional assets placed in-service. The increase in the prior year was driven by the acceleration of amortization related to a shorter useful life of certain software as well as additional assets placed in-service.\nOperating results attributable to the Braves Holdings were as follows.\nStrategies and Challenges of Business Units\nOn September 7, 2016, Liberty, through its indirect wholly owned subsidiary Liberty GR Cayman Acquisition Company, entered into two definitive stock purchase agreements relating to the acquisition of Delta Topco, the parent company of Formula 1. The transactions contemplated by the first purchase agreement were completed on September 7, 2016, resulting in the acquisition of slightly less than a 20% minority stake in Formula 1 on an undiluted basis. On October 27, 2016 under the terms of the first purchase agreement, Liberty acquired an additional incremental equity interest of Delta Topco, maintaining Liberty's investment in Delta Topco on an undiluted basis and increasing slightly to 19.1% on a fully diluted basis. Liberty acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity interests of Delta Topco, other than a nominal number of shares held by certain Formula 1 teams, in a closing under the second purchase agreement (and following the unwind of the first purchase agreement) on January 23, 2017. See note 5 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the acquisition. Liberty's acquired interest in Delta Topco and by extension Formula 1, along with existing Formula 1 cash and debt (which is non-recourse to Liberty), was attributed to the Formula One Group upon completion of the Second Closing. Formula 1 is a reportable segment.\nSIRIUS XM is the only operating subsidiary attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group. In the event SIRIUS XM were to become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, Liberty's management would evaluate the circumstances at such time and take appropriate steps in the best interest of all of its stockholders, which may not be in the best interest of a particular group or groups when considered independently. In such a situation, Liberty's management and its board of directors would have several approaches at their disposal, including, but not limited to, the conversion of the Liberty SiriusXM common stock into another tracking stock of Liberty, the reattribution of assets and liabilities among Liberty's tracking stock groups or the restructuring of Liberty's tracking stocks to either create a new tracking stock structure or eliminate it altogether. On February 1, 2019, SIRIUS XM acquired Pandora Media, Inc. ( Pandora\u201d). See note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the acquisition of Pandora.\nThe increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year was primarily attributable to higher logistics and digital media revenue, contributions from broadcasting in Ultra High Definition and higher hospitality revenue, partially offset by lower spend by GP3 series' competing teams during 2017 due to it being the second year of the GP3 vehicle cycle.\n\nFormula 1's operating results were as follows:\nAs discussed in note 2 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, on April 15, 2016, Liberty completed the Recapitalization. Upon completion of the Second Closing, as discussed below, the Liberty Media Group was renamed the Formula One Group. Although the Recapitalization was not effective for all periods presented herein, information has been presented among the tracking stock groups for all periods presented as if the Recapitalization had been completed for all periods presented. This attribution of historical financial information does not purport to be what actual results and balances would have been if the Recapitalization had actually occurred and been in place during the periods prior to April 15, 2016. Operating results prior to the Recapitalization are attributed to Liberty stockholders in the aggregate.\nOther revenue includes advertising revenue, equipment revenue, royalty revenue and other ancillary revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other revenue increased 24% and 16%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily driven by higher U.S. music royalty fee revenue due to a higher rate and an increase in the number of subscribers and higher revenue generated from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and SIRIUS XM Canada. In addition, equipment revenue increased due to additional royalty revenue due to SIRIUS XM's transition to a new generation of chipsets. The prior year increase was driven by higher revenue from Sirius XM Canada due to the new Services Agreement and Advisory Services Agreement entered into in the second quarter of 2017, additional revenue from the U.S. Music Royalty Fee due to an increase in the number of subscribers and subscribers paying at a higher rate and higher revenue generated from SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services. Equipment revenue increased during the prior year driven by royalty revenue on certain satellite radio components starting in the second quarter of 2016 due to SIRIUS XM's transition to a new generation of chipsets and revenue from the sales of connected vehicle devices since the acquisition of Automatic, partially offset by lower revenue generated through satellite radio sales to distributors and consumers and lower OEM production. Advertising revenue increased during both periods due to a greater number of advertising spots sold and transmitted along with increased rates charged per spot.\nFormula One Group\nWe own controlling and non-controlling interests in a broad range of media and entertainment companies. Our most significant operating subsidiary, which is a reportable segment, is Sirius XM Holdings Inc. ( SIRIUS XM\u201d). SIRIUS XM provides a subscription based satellite radio service. SIRIUS XM also transmits a larger set of music and other channels through SIRIUS XM's streaming service. SIRIUS XM's streaming services is available online and through applications for mobile devices, home devices and other consumer electronic equipment. SIRIUS XM also provides connected vehicle services which are designed to enhance the safety, security and driving experience for vehicle operators while providing marketing and operational benefits to automakers and their dealers.\nResults of Operations-Businesses\n\n \u00b7 acquisitions and investments, including acquisitions and investments that are not directly related to its satellite radio business. \nFormula 1. Formula 1 is a global motorsports business that holds exclusive commercial rights with respect to the World Championship, an annual, approximately nine-month long, motor race-based competition in which teams compete for the Constructors' Championship and drivers compete for the Drivers' Championship. The World Championship takes place on various circuits with various Events. Formula 1 is responsible for the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship. Formula 1 derives its primary revenue from the commercial exploitation and development of the World Championship through a combination of entering into race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship arrangements. A significant majority of the race promotion, broadcasting and advertising and sponsorship contracts specify payments in advance and annual increases in the fees payable over the course of the contracts.\nII-17\nII-9\nII-24\nSIRIUS XM's primary uses of cash were the repurchase of outstanding SIRIUS XM common stock, dividends paid to stockholders and additions to property and equipment resulting from new satellite construction. The SIRIUS XM uses of cash were funded by cash provided by operating activities, cash on hand and borrowings of debt. During the year ended December 31, 2018, SIRIUS XM declared a cash dividend each quarter, and paid in cash an aggregate amount of $201 million, of which Liberty received $143 million. SIRIUS XM's board of directors expects to declare regular quarterly dividends, in an aggregate annual amount of $0.0484 per share of common stock. On January 29, 2019, SIRIUS XM's board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on its common stock in the amount of $0.0121 per share of common stock, payable on February 28, 2019 to stockholders of record at the close of business on February 11, 2019.\nFormula 1's primary use of cash was the net repayment of debt.\nOther operating expenses primarily include costs associated with baseball and stadium operations. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other operating expenses decreased $34 million and increased $57 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 was driven by lower player salaries. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was driven primarily by increases in player costs and higher concession, parking and security costs associated with the new stadium.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, an equity method affiliate of Braves Holdings sold a controlling interest in a subsidiary, resulting in Braves Holdings recording its portion of the gain of $69 million.\n \u00b7 capturing opportunities created by media's evolution, including the growth of social media and the development of Formula 1's digital media assets; \nSIRIUS XM faces certain key challenges in its attempt to meet these goals, including:\nII-18\n\n \u00b7 working with stakeholders within the sport to improve the sustainability and on-track competitive balance of the World Championship and the long term financial stability of the participating Teams. \nII-19\nII-20\nOur Corporate and Other\u201d category includes a consolidated subsidiary, Braves Holdings, LLC ( Braves Holdings\u201d) and corporate expenses. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. ( Live Nation\u201d), which is accounted for as an equity method investment at December 31, 2018 and is included in corporate and other. We also maintain minority positions in other public companies.\nSubscriber revenue includes subscription, activation and other fees. Subscriber revenue increased 3% and 7% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was primarily attributable to a 5% increase in the daily weighted average number of subscribers, partially offset by the impact of the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and all related amendments, which established Accounting Standards Codification Topic 606 ( ASC 606\u201d), effective as of January 1, 2018. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to a 4% increase in the daily weighted average number of subscribers as well as a 3% increase in SIRIUS XM's average monthly revenue per subscriber resulting from certain rate increases.\n \u00b7 continuing to seek and identify opportunities to expand and develop the Event calendar and bring Events to attractive and/or strategically important new markets outside of Europe, which typically have higher race promotion fees, while continuing to build on the foundation of the sport in Europe; \nDepreciation and amortization increased $9 million and $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 is due to an increase in depreciation related to the stadium, which was placed into service on March 21, 2017, partially offset by lower amortization expense related to international player contracts. The increase during 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in depreciation related to the stadium and an increase in property and equipment to support the Development Project.\nSIRIUS XM's primary source of revenue is subscription fees, with most of its customers subscribing to monthly, quarterly, semi-annual or annual plans. SIRIUS XM offers discounts for prepaid subscription plans, as well as a multiple subscription discount. SIRIUS XM also derives revenue from certain fees, the sale of advertising on select non-music channels, the direct sale of satellite radios and accessories and other ancillary services, such as weather, data and traffic services. SIRIUS XM provides traffic services to approximately 8.6 million vehicles.\n\nII-10\nyear, partially offset by approximately $18 million in dividend and interest income, primarily due to dividends on Time Warner, Inc. shares.\nCost of Formula 1 revenue increased approximately $52 million and decreased $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. Cost of Formula 1 revenue consists primarily of team payments.\nSubscriber acquisition costs include hardware subsidies paid to radio manufacturers, distributors and automakers, including subsidies paid for chipsets and certain other components used in manufacturing radios; device royalties for certain radios and chipsets; product warranty obligations; and freight. The majority of subscriber acquisition costs are incurred and expensed in advance of, or concurrent with, acquiring a subscriber. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, subscriber acquisition costs decreased 6% and 3%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in\nLiberty acquired a controlling interest in Formula 1 on January 23, 2017 and applied acquisition accounting and consolidated the results of Formula 1 from that date. Prior to the acquisition of our controlling interest, we maintained an investment in Formula 1 since September 7, 2016, which was accounted for as a cost method investment. Although Formula 1's results are only included in Liberty's results since January 23, 2017, we believe a discussion of Formula 1's results for all periods presented promotes a better understanding of the overall results of its business. For comparison and discussion purposes, we are presenting the pro forma results of Formula 1 for the full years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, inclusive of acquisition accounting adjustments. The pro forma financial information was prepared based on the historical financial information of Formula 1 and assuming the acquisition of Formula 1 took place on January 1, 2016. The pro forma adjustments have been made solely for the purpose of providing comparative pro forma financial\ndigital media and hospitality costs, partially offset by a lower circuit rights' fee under the contractual arrangements of one Event and the impact of one less Event in the year.\nII-26\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Listed below are the accounting estimates that we believe are critical to our financial statements due to the degree of uncertainty regarding the estimates or assumptions involved and the magnitude of the asset, liability, revenue or expense being reported. All of these accounting estimates and assumptions, as well as the resulting impact to our financial statements, have been discussed with our audit committee.\nOther operating expense includes engineering, design and development costs consisting primarily of compensation and related costs to develop chipsets and new products and services. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, other operating expense increased 9% and 41%, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase was driven by the continued development of SIRIUS XM's streaming product and connected vehicle services. The prior year increase was driven by the development of SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and additional costs associated with the development of SIRIUS XM's audio and video streaming products.\nThe term Braves Group\u201d does not represent a separate legal entity, rather it represents those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to that group. The Braves Group is primarily comprised of Braves Holdings, which indirectly owns the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball Club ( ANLBC,\u201d the Braves,\u201d or the Atlanta Braves\u201d) and certain assets and liabilities associated with ANLBC's stadium and mixed use development project (the Development Project\u201d) and corporate cash. As of December 31, 2018, the Braves Group has cash and cash equivalents of approximately $107 million, which includes $40 million of subsidiary cash. Additionally, as discussed below, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group. See note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering.\nSIRIUS XM has agreements with every major automaker ( OEMs\u201d) to offer satellite radio in their vehicles, through which it acquires the majority of its subscribers. SIRIUS XM also acquires subscribers through marketing to owners and lessees of previously owned vehicles that include factory-installed satellite radios that are not currently subscribing to SIRIUS XM's services. SIRIUS XM distributes its radios primarily through automakers, retailers and its website. Satellite radio services are also offered to customers of certain rental car companies.\n\nII-8\nSIRIUS XM's satellites have been designed to last fifteen-years. SIRIUS XM's in-orbit satellites may experience component failures which could adversely affect their useful lives. SIRIUS XM monitors the operating condition of its in-orbit satellites.

As of December 31, 2018, the Formula One Group (formerly the Liberty Media Group) is primarily comprised of all of the businesses, assets and liabilities of Liberty other than those specifically attributed to the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Braves Group, including Liberty's interests in Formula 1 and Live Nation, Liberty's 1.375% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023 and related financial instruments, Liberty's 1% Cash Convertible Notes due 2023, Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2046 and Liberty's 2.25% Exchangeable Senior Debentures due 2048. Following the creation of the tracking stocks and the closing of the Series C Liberty Braves common stock rights offering, the Formula One Group retains an intergroup interest in the Braves Group of approximately 15.1%, valued at $226 million, as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Formula One Group had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $160 million, which includes $30 million of subsidiary cash.\nOverview\n (2) Amounts (i) are based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2018, (ii) assume the interest rates on our variable rate debt remain constant at the December 31, 2018 rates and (iii) assume that our existing debt is repaid at maturity. \nOperating income. Our consolidated operating income increased $117 million and decreased $340 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Operating losses decreased $114 million and operating income increased $73 million for Braves Group and Liberty SiriusXM Group, respectively, and operating losses increased $70 million for Formula One Group during 2018 as compared to the prior year. The decrease in corporate and other operating losses for Formula One Group for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by costs related to the acquisition of Formula 1 recognized during the year ended December 31, 2017. Formula One Group operating income decreased $483 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year, largely due to the favorable one-time net $511 million Vivendi lawsuit settlement during the first quarter of 2016, as discussed in note 17 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Liberty SiriusXM Group operating income increased $195 million and Braves Group operating loss increased $52 million during 2017 as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nTo the extent the Company recognizes any taxable gains from the sale of assets we may incur tax expense and be required to make tax payments, thereby reducing any cash proceeds. Additionally, the Company has a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM which has significant cash flows provided by operating activities, although due to SIRIUS XM being a separate public company and the significant noncontrolling interest, we do not have ready access to its cash. Cash held by Formula 1 is accessible by Liberty, except when certain restricted payment tests imposed by the Senior Loan Facility at Formula 1 are not met. As of December 31, 2018, Liberty had $750 million available under a $1.35 billion margin loan due 2020 and $600 million available under the Live Nation Margin Loan. Certain tax consequences may reduce the net amount of cash that Liberty is able to utilize for corporate purposes. Liberty believes that it currently has appropriate legal structures in place to repatriate foreign cash as tax efficiently as possible and meet the business needs of the Company.\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, finance and related personnel costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased $3 million and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase in 2018 as compared to 2017 was primarily driven by higher marketing costs in conjunction with the 2018 MLB playoffs and higher expenses related to the Development Project. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to costs incurred with the new stadium and the write-off of certain contractual rights related to international players.\nUseful Life of Broadcast/Transmission System. SIRIUS XM's satellite system includes the costs of satellite construction, launch vehicles, launch insurance, capitalized interest, spare satellites, terrestrial repeater network and satellite uplink facilities. SIRIUS XM monitors its satellites for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable.\n \u00b7 During 2017, in connection with the initial analysis of the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act\u201d), as discussed in note 11 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded a discrete net tax benefit, primarily driven by the corporate tax rate reduction. \nThe following are potential sources of liquidity: available cash balances, cash generated by the operating activities of our privately-owned subsidiaries (to the extent such cash exceeds the working capital needs of the subsidiaries and is not otherwise restricted), proceeds from net asset sales, monetization of our public investment portfolio, debt and equity issuances, available borrowing capacity under margin loans, and dividend and interest receipts.\nLiberty's primary uses of cash during the year ended December 31, 2018 (excluding cash used by SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings) were $466 million of Series C Liberty SiriusXM common stock repurchases and $414 million of investments in equity method affiliates and debt and equity securities. These uses were funded by borrowings of debt and cash on hand.\nIncome taxes. Our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was an expense of 17%, benefit of 129% and expense of 35%, respectively. Our effective tax rate for all three years was impacted for the following reasons:\nFormula 1's uses of cash are expected to be debt service payments, as well as continued investment in its business. Liberty expects Formula 1 to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand and cash provided by operations.\nWe acquired a controlling interest in SIRIUS XM on January 18, 2013 and applied purchase accounting and consolidated the results of SIRIUS XM from that date. The results presented for SIRIUS XM below include the impacts of acquisition accounting adjustments in all periods presented. Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, there is an approximate 27% noncontrolling interest in SIRIUS XM, and the net earnings of SIRIUS XM attributable to such noncontrolling interest is eliminated through the noncontrolling interest line item in the consolidated statement of\n \u00b7 unfavorable changes in legislation. \nAs of December 31, 2018, the intangible assets not subject to amortization for each of our significant reporting units were as follows (amounts in millions):\nOther costs of Formula 1 revenue include hospitality costs, which are principally related to catering and other aspects of the production and delivery of the Paddock Club, and circuit rights' fees payable under various agreements with race promoters to acquire certain commercial rights at Events, including the right to sell advertising, hospitality and support race opportunities. Other costs include annual Federation Internationale de l'Automobile regulatory fees, advertising and sponsorship commissions and those incurred in the provision and sale of freight, travel and logistical services, and GP3 cars, parts and maintenance services, television production and post-production services, advertising production services and digital and social media activities. These costs are largely variable in nature and relate directly to revenue opportunities. Other costs of Formula 1 revenue increased $58 million and $12 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase is primarily due to increased technical, logistics and travel, hospitality and Formula 2 and GP3 costs associated with the changes in the World Championship calendar, increased costs associated with sale of the new Formula 2 chassis and components to the competing Formula 2 teams during the first season of the latest three year Formula 2 cycle, costs associated with increased fan engagement activities, technical and digital media development and delivery and higher freight and hospitality costs. The prior year increase is due to increasing fan engagement activities, filming in Ultra High definition and higher freight,\nOther Formula 1 revenue is generated from miscellaneous and ancillary sources primarily related to administering the shipment of cars and equipment to and from events outside of Europe, revenue from the sale of tickets to the Formula One Paddock Club at most Events, support races at Events (either from the direct operation of the and GP3 series (the latter of which will be replaced in 2019 by the series) or from the licensing of other third party series or individual race events), various television production and post-production activities, digital and social media services and other ancillary operations.\n (1) Amounts are stated at the face amount at maturity of our debt instruments and may differ from the amounts stated in our consolidated balance sheet to the extent debt instruments (i) were issued at a discount or premium or (ii) have elements which are reported at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet. Amounts include capital lease obligations. Amounts do not assume additional borrowings or refinancings of existing debt. \n \u00b7 significant new or enhanced distribution arrangements; \nConsolidated Adjusted OIBDA increased $184 million and $720 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2018 as compared to the prior year was due to increases of $120 million and $86 million in Liberty SiriusXM Group and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA, respectively, partially offset by a $22 million decrease in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA. The increase in Adjusted OIBDA in 2017 as compared to the prior year was due to increases of $442 million in Formula One Group Adjusted OIBDA, Liberty SiriusXM Group Adjusted OIBDA of $256 million and Braves Group Adjusted OIBDA of $22 million. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\nNet earnings. We had net earnings of $865 million, $1,890 million and $924 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in net earnings was the result of the above-described fluctuations in our revenue, expenses and other gains and losses.\n \u00b7 investments in infrastructure, such as satellites, equipment or radio spectrum; and \n \u00b7 During 2016, our effective tax rate was equal to the federal tax rate of 35% due to the offsetting impact of state income taxes and federal tax credits claimed by SIRIUS XM. \nA tracking stock is a type of common stock that the issuing company intends to reflect or track\u201d the economic performance of a particular business or group,\u201d rather than the economic performance of the company as a whole. While the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Liberty Braves Group (the Braves Group\u201d) and Formula One Group have separate collections of businesses, assets and liabilities attributed to them, no group is a separate legal entity and therefore cannot own assets, issue securities or enter into legally binding agreements. Therefore, the Liberty SiriusXM Group, Braves Group and Formula One Group do not represent separate legal entities, but rather represent those businesses, assets and liabilities that have been attributed to each respective group. Holders of tracking stock have no direct claim to the group's stock or assets and therefore, do not own, by virtue of their ownership of a Liberty tracking stock, any equity or voting interest in a company, such as SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 or Live Nation, in which Liberty holds an interest and that is attributed to a Liberty tracking stock group, such as the Liberty SiriusXM Group or the Formula One Group. Holders of tracking stock\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets. Depreciation and amortization was relatively flat during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to pro forma depreciation and amortization in the corresponding period in the prior year. Pro forma depreciation and amortization increased $48 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year. The increase was driven by an increase in amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of Formula 1 by Liberty.\nStock-based compensation decreased $36 million and increased $37 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The decrease in 2018 as compared to 2017 is due to vesting of outstanding awards in 2017, the start of a new plan period in 2018 and decreases in the fair value of the underlying awards. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 is due to an increase in the value of Braves Holdings and vesting of outstanding awards.\nII-25\nTeam payments decreased by $6 million and $47 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The decreases were attributable to reductions in the variable elements of the Prize Fund which are calculated based on Formula 1's revenue and costs.\n \u00b7 the effectiveness of integration of acquired businesses and assets into its operations; \nRevenue. Our consolidated revenue increased $446 million and $2,318 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The 2018 increase was driven by revenue growth at SIRIUS XM, Braves Holdings and Formula 1 of $346 million, $56 million and $44 million, respectively. The 2017 increase was primarily driven by $1,783 million of Formula 1 revenue, as a result of the Company's acquisition of Formula 1 on January 23, 2017, and revenue growth at SIRIUS XM of $411 million. Additionally, Braves Holdings revenue increased $124 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the prior year. See Results of Operations-Businesses\u201d below for a more complete discussion of the results of operations of SIRIUS XM, Formula 1 and Braves Holdings.\n \u00b7 Programming and Content includes costs to acquire, create, promote and produce content. Programming and content costs increased 5% and 8% during 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven primarily by increased personnel-related costs and higher music licensing costs. The prior year increase was due to the addition of video content rights, the payment for which started during the third quarter of 2016, as well as increased talent and personnel related costs. \nThe prior year decrease was due to one less Event during 2017 compared to 2016 and legacy contractual terms of one Event, which provided a one time significant decrease in race promotion fees after the 2016 season through the remaining term of that contract. These decreases in race promotion revenue were partially offset by the impact of other contractual increases. Broadcasting revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the same period in the prior year due to the impact of certain contractual rate increases, partially offset by the net adverse impact of weaker prevailing foreign currency exchange rates used to translate a small number of fees that were not denominated in U.S. Dollars. Advertising and sponsorship revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to\n \u00b7 potential loss of subscribers due to economic conditions and competition from other entertainment providers; \nII-11\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOther, net. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to a $48 million decrease in losses on early extinguishment of debt and a $17 million increase in gains on transactions, primarily driven by the sale of the residential portion of Braves Holdings' mixed-use complex. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to a $19 million increase in interest and dividend income and a $12 million increase in gains on transactions, partially offset by a $24 million increase in losses on early extinguishment of debt, primarily related to the redemption of certain debt at SIRIUS XM. The loss in 2016 was primarily due to a $24 million loss on extinguishment of SIRIUS XM's redemption of its 5.875% Senior Notes due 2020 during the\nBraves Holdings. Braves Holdings is our wholly owned subsidiary that indirectly owns and operates the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball club and six minor league baseball clubs (the Gwinnett Stripers, the Mississippi Braves, the Rome Braves, the Danville Braves, the GCL Braves and the Dominican Summer League). Braves Holdings had exclusive operating rights to Turner Field, the home stadium of the Atlanta Braves, until December 31, 2016 pursuant to an Operating Agreement with the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority. Effective for the 2017 season, the Braves relocated to a new ballpark in Cobb County, a suburb of Atlanta. The facility is leased from Cobb County and Cobb-Marietta Coliseum and Exhibit Hall Authority and offers a range of activities and eateries for fans. Braves Holdings and its affiliates participated in the construction of the new stadium and are participating in the construction of an adjacent mixed-use development project, which we refer to as the Development Project.\n\nThe Atlanta Braves have entered into long-term employment contracts with certain of their players and coaches whereby such individuals' compensation is guaranteed. Amounts due under guaranteed contracts as of December 31, 2018 aggregated $165 million. See the table below for more detail. In addition to the foregoing amounts, certain players and coaches may earn incentive compensation under the terms of their employment contracts.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n \u00b7 Other includes costs associated with the operation and maintenance of SIRIUS XM's terrestrial repeater networks; satellites; satellite telemetry, tracking and control systems; satellite uplink facilities; studios; and delivery of SIRIUS XM's streaming service and connected vehicle services as well as costs from the sale of satellite radios, components and accessories and provisions for inventory allowance attributable to products purchased for resale in SIRIUS XM's direct to consumer distribution channels. Other costs of subscriber services increased 8% and decreased 19% during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. The current year increase was primarily driven by higher wireless costs associated with SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services and higher streaming costs, partially offset by lower direct satellite radio sales to consumers. The prior year decrease was driven by lower wireless costs associated with SIRIUS XM's connected vehicle services, a reduction in terrestrial repeater costs as a result of the elimination of duplicative repeater sites, and lower sales to distributors and consumers, partially offset by increased streaming costs and the incremental costs associated with the sale of connected vehicle devices since the acquisition of Automatic. \nChanges in unrealized gains (losses) on debt measured at fair value are due to market factors primarily driven by changes in the fair value of the underlying shares into which the debt is exchangeable.\nShare of earnings (losses) of affiliates. The following table presents our share of earnings (losses) of affiliates:\nSIRIUS XM operates three in-orbit XM satellites, XM-3, XM-4 and XM-5. SIRIUS XM estimates that its XM-3 and XM-4 satellites launched in 2005 and 2006, respectively, will reach the end of their depreciable lives in 2020 and 2021, respectively. The XM-5 satellite that was launched in 2010, is used as an in-orbit spare for the Sirius and XM systems and is expected to reach the end of its depreciable life in 2025.\nWe recorded $192 million, $230 million and $150 million of stock compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in stock compensation expense in 2018 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to decreases of $36 million and $8 million at Braves Holdings and Formula 1, respectively, partially offset by increases of $9 million at SIRIUS XM. The increase in stock compensation expense in 2017 as compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases of $37 million at Braves Holdings, $23 million at Formula 1 and $15 million at SIRIUS XM.\nComponents of Other Income (Expense) are presented in the table below.\nare also not represented by separate boards of directors. Instead, holders of tracking stock are stockholders of the parent corporation, with a single board of directors and subject to all of the risks and liabilities of the parent corporation.\nII-16\nII-15\n\nBraves Group\nII-23\nII-13\nResults of Operations-Consolidated\nStock-based compensation. Stock-based compensation includes compensation related to (1) options and stock appreciation rights for shares of our common stock that are granted to certain of our officers and employees, (2) phantom stock appreciation rights granted to officers and employees of certain of our subsidiaries pursuant to private equity plans and (3) amortization of restricted stock grants.\nLiberty SiriusXM Group\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include personnel costs, legal, professional and other advisory fees, bad debt expense, rental expense, information technology costs, non-Event-related travel costs, insurance premiums, maintenance and utility costs and other general office administration costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $29 million and $35 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding periods in the prior year. The current year increase was primarily driven by higher marketing and research costs and an increase in bad debt expense. The increases in pro forma selling, general and administrative expense during 2017 were primarily driven by higher personnel, property, marketing and research costs and advisory fees, all due to the acquisition by Liberty of Formula 1, partially offset by an improvement in foreign exchange related gains and lower bad debt expense during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the corresponding prior year period.\nRevenue includes amounts generated from Braves Holdings' baseball and development operations. Baseball revenue is derived from three primary sources: ballpark operations (ticket sales, concessions, corporate sales, suites and premium seat fees), local and national broadcast rights, licensing and other shared Major League Baseball ( MLB\u201d) revenue streams. Development revenue is derived from the mixed-use facilities and primarily includes rental income. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, revenue increased $56 million and $124 million, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior years. Baseball revenue per game increased in 2018 due to ticket sales and concession revenue primarily due to increases in attendance driven by team performance, including post season revenue from the 2018 MLB playoffs. Development revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the prior year as Braves Holdings had just begun renting the mixed-use facilities in 2017. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the move to the new stadium which increased the number of tickets sold, the average ticket price and concession revenue. Additionally, the new mixed-use development added revenue that Braves Holdings did not have in the previous year.\nBraves Holdings' uses of cash are expected to be expenditures related to the mixed-use development and new spring training facility. Liberty expects Braves Holdings to fund its projected uses of cash with borrowings under its existing debt instruments, cash provided by operations and through the issuance of new construction loans for Phase II. See Item 1. Business - (c) Narrative Description of Business - Braves Holdings, LLC - Mixed-use development.\nII-22\nII-12\nSIRIUS XM's uses of cash are expected to be operating expenses, capital expenditures, including the construction of replacement satellites, working capital requirements, interest payments, taxes and scheduled maturities of outstanding debt. Liberty expects SIRIUS XM to fund its projected uses of cash with cash on hand, cash provided by operations and borrowings under the existing credit facility.\nConsolidated Operating Results\nSIRIUS XM operates two in-orbit Sirius satellites, FM-5 and FM-6. SIRIUS XM estimates that its FM-5 and FM-6 satellites, launched in 2009 and 2013, respectively, will operate effectively through the end of their depreciable lives in 2024 and 2028, respectively.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Aggregate Contractual Obligations\nInterest expense. Consolidated interest expense increased $15 million and $229 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increase for 2018 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in the average amount of corporate and subsidiary debt outstanding during the current period for Liberty SiriusXM Group and the capitalization of interest related to construction of the stadium and mixed-use facilities during the prior period for Braves Group, partially offset by decreases in interest expense for the Formula One Group due to decreases in the average amount of corporate and subsidiary debt outstanding. The increase in 2017 as compared to the prior year was primarily due to approximately $167 million of interest expense attributable to debt held at Formula 1, which we began consolidating on January 23, 2017 when we acquired Formula 1. The remaining increase in 2017 was due to an increase in the average amount of corporate, SIRIUS XM and other subsidiary debt outstanding.\n \u00b7 competition for both listeners and advertisers, including providers of radio and other audio services; \nII-7\n \u00b7 the operational performance of its satellites; \n\nSelling, general and administrative expense includes costs of marketing, advertising, media and production, including promotional events and sponsorships; cooperative marketing; compensation and related personnel costs; facilities costs, finance, legal, human resources and information technology costs. Selling, general and administrative expense increased 9% and 6% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, as compared to the corresponding prior year periods. The increases for both years were due to additional subscriber communications, retention programs and acquisition campaigns as well as higher personnel-related costs. Additional increases during the year ended December 31, 2018 were driven by higher information technology costs, a one-time charge for sales and use taxes and expenses associated with the Pandora acquisition. The increases during the year ended December 31, 2017 were partially offset by the timing of certain OEM marketing campaigns, lower legal costs, litigation reserves and consulting costs.\nThe increase for the year ended December 31, 2018 was driven by an increase in race promotion fees due to contractual increases in fees for certain Events and increased economics from contractual arrangements at one Event (which was fully offset by a decrease in advertising and sponsorship revenue, as discussed below). In addition, broadcasting revenue increased during the current period as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates used to translate Great Britain Pound and Euro-denominated contracts into U.S. Dollars and the impact of certain contractual rate increases, partially offset by the early termination of one contract with a failing broadcast rights holder. Advertising and sponsorship revenue decreased during the current period as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year due to revised contractual arrangements at one Event and non-renewal of another small sponsorship arrangement, partially offset by revenue from new contracts and increases in existing contracts.\n", "item_7_tables": "Table 174: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

discussion and analysis:\n\n- Revenue increased in 2018 and 2017 primarily due to growth at SiriusXM, the acquisition of Formula 1 in 2017, and revenue growth at the Braves Holdings. \n\n- Operating income increased in 2018 but decreased in 2017. The decrease in 2017 was largely due to a one-time lawsuit settlement gain in 2016.\n\n- Net earnings increased in 2018 compared to 2017 but decreased from 2016 to 2017, driven by fluctuations in revenue, expenses, and other gains/losses.\n\n- Adjusted OIBDA, which excludes certain costs like stock compensation, increased in both 2018 and 2017, with growth at SiriusXM, Formula 1, and the Braves Holdings.\n\n- SiriusXM revenue grew in 2018 and 2017 due to increases in subscribers and subscription rates. Expenses also rose but operating income still increased.\n\n- Formula 1 revenue increased in 2018 due to higher race promotion fees but decreased in 2017 due to fewer events. Operating losses increased in 2018 but decreased in 2017.\n\n- Braves Holdings revenue increased in 2018 and 2017 due to the new stadium. Operating losses decreased in 2018 but increased in 2017 due to higher expenses.\n\n- Cash provided by operations increased in 2018 but decreased in 2017. Main uses of cash were debt repayments, stock repurchases, and investments.\n\nIn summary, revenue and earnings grew over the past two years, driven by SiriusXM growth and the Formula 1 acquisition, despite higher expenditures. Operating cash flows also increased in 2018 after declining in 2017."}
