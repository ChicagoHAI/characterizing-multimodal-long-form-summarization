MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOverview\nGriffin Industrial Realty, Inc. ( Griffin\u201d) is a real estate business principally engaged in developing, managing and leasing industrial/warehouse properties, and to a lesser extent, office/flex properties. Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin's core development and leasing strategy. Griffin seeks to add to its property portfolio through the acquisition and development of land or the purchase of buildings. Prior to May 13, 2015, Griffin was known as Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc. On May 13, 2015, Griffin changed its name to better reflect its ongoing real estate business and focus on industrial/warehouse properties after the sale in fiscal 2014 of the landscape nursery business that Griffin had operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. ( Imperial\u201d). Effective January 8, 2014, Griffin, Imperial and Monrovia Connecticut LLC ( Monrovia\u201d) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby Imperial's inventory and certain of its assets were sold to Monrovia for approximately $0.7 million in cash, before transaction and severance costs, and a non-interest bearing note receivable (which Griffin subsequently collected) of $4.25 million (the Imperial Sale\u201d).\nThe notes to Griffin's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Griffin's consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, because of the relative magnitude of Griffin's real estate assets, accounting methods and estimates related to those assets are critical to the preparation of Griffin's consolidated financial statements. Griffin uses accounting policies and methods under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The following are the critical accounting estimates and methods used by Griffin:\nIncome taxes: In accounting for income taxes under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d management estimates future taxable income from operations, the sale of appreciated assets, the remaining years before the expiration of loss credit carryforwards, future reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that Griffin will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets.\nImpairment of long-lived assets: Griffin reviews annually, as well as when conditions may indicate, its long-lived assets to determine if there are any indications of impairment, such as a prolonged vacancy in one of Griffin's rental properties. If indications of impairment are present, Griffin evaluates the carrying value of the assets in relation to undiscounted cash flows or the estimated fair value of the underlying assets. Development costs that have been capitalized are reviewed periodically for future recoverability.\nRevenue and gain recognition: Revenue includes rental revenue from Griffin's industrial and commercial properties and proceeds from property sales. Rental revenue is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term in accordance with the FASB ASC 840, Leases.\u201d Gains on property sales are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 360-20 Property, Plant and Equipment-Real Estate Sales\u201d based on the specific terms of each sale. When the percentage of completion method is used to account for a sale of real estate, costs included in determining the percentage of completion include the costs of the land sold, allocated master planning costs, selling and transaction costs and estimated future costs related to the land sold.\nStock based compensation: Griffin determines stock based compensation based on the estimated fair values of stock options as determined on their grant dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In determining the estimated fair values of stock options issued, Griffin makes assumptions on expected volatility, risk free interest rates, expected option terms and dividend yields.\nDerivative instruments: Griffin evaluates each interest rate swap agreement to determine if it qualifies as an effective cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of each interest rate swap agreement that management determines to be an effective cash flow hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined based on observable market participant data, such as yield curves, as of the fair value measurement date.\nSummary\nIn the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 ( fiscal 2016\u201d), Griffin had net income of approximately $0.6 million as compared to net income of approximately $0.4 million in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 ( fiscal 2015\u201d). The slightly higher net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 principally reflects an increase of approximately $1.3 million in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.8 million in interest expense and an increase of approximately $0.3 million in income taxes in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe approximately $1.3 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects an increase of approximately $2.0 million in profit from leasing activities (which Griffin defines as rental revenue less operating expenses of rental properties) and an increase of approximately $0.7 million in gain on property sales (revenue from property sales less costs related to property sales), partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expense and general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.1 million and approximately $0.3 million, respectively. The increase in profit from leasing activities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was driven by an increase in rental revenue from more space being leased in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015. The higher gain on property sales in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects the gain of approximately $3.2 million from the sale of undeveloped Griffin Center land that closed in fiscal 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects a full year of depreciation expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to a partial year in fiscal 2015, on 5220 Jaindl Boulevard ( 5220 Jaindl\u201d), an approximately 280,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania that was completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter and depreciation expense on tenant improvements related to new leases being higher in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects higher expenses related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan.\nThe higher interest expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects less interest capitalized in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015 and the higher amount of mortgage loans outstanding in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The higher income tax expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 reflects the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and an increase in income tax expense related to the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016 and a reduction in the valuation of certain state deferred tax assets.\nResults of Operations\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nTotal revenue increased to approximately $30.9 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $28.1 million in fiscal 2015, reflecting an increase of approximately $1.9 million in rental revenue and approximately $0.9 million in revenue from property sales. Rental revenue increased to approximately $26.5 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $24.6 million in fiscal 2015 principally reflecting: (a) an increase of approximately $1.9 million from leasing previously vacant space; and (b) an increase of approximately $1.6 million from leasing space in 5220 Jaindl, which was completed and placed in service at the start of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter; partially offset by (c) a decrease of approximately $1.5 million from leases that expired; and (d) a decrease of approximately $0.2 million of rental revenue from lower expense reimbursements from tenants and other changes.\nA summary of the total square footage and leased square footage of the buildings in Griffin's real estate portfolio is as follows:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,297,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,066,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,045,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,706,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total square footage as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, reflects the construction in fiscal 2016 of 5210 Jaindl Boulevard ( 5210 Jaindl\u201d), an approximately 252,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building which is the second of the two buildings built on an approximately 50 acre parcel of land known as Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. 5210 Jaindl was completed in the 2016 third quarter and Griffin entered into two leases for that building, resulting in 5210 Jaindl being fully leased as of November 30, 2016. Both of the new leases at 5210 Jaindl will become effective upon completion of tenant improvements, which are expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2017. As a result of leasing 5210 Jaindl, Griffin now has five fully leased industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley aggregating approximately 1,183,000 square feet.\nThe net increase of approximately 360,000 square feet leased as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, reflects the approximately 252,000 square feet leased at 5210 Jaindl and several new leases aggregating approximately 240,000 square feet in other buildings, partially offset by several leases aggregating approximately 132,000 square feet that expired. Included in the approximately 240,000 square feet of new leasing in fiscal 2016 are a lease of approximately 101,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch Drive ( 4270 Fritch\u201d), one of Griffin's other industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley, a full building lease of 25 International Drive ( 25 International\u201d), an approximately 57,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in New England Tradeport ( NE Tradeport\u201d), Griffin's industrial park in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut, a full building lease of an approximately 31,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Bloomfield, Connecticut, and a lease of approximately 16,000 square feet in a single story office building in Griffin Center. The new lease of 25 International replaced a lease that expired earlier in the year. The tenant of the expired lease had, in fiscal 2014, entered into a ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow Road ( 758 Rainbow\u201d), an approximately 138,000 square foot building in NE Tradeport, while remaining in 25 International during its period of transition to the larger facility.\nAlso in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Griffin entered into a new three year lease of its production nursery in Quincy, Florida (the Florida Farm\u201d). The Florida Farm had been leased to a nursery grower since fiscal 2009, but that lease ended in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. The new lease contains an option for the tenant to purchase the Florida Farm for a purchase price between $3.4 million and $3.9 million depending upon the date of sale.\nAll of Griffin's Connecticut industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings are in the north submarket of Hartford. The real estate market for industrial/warehouse space in the Hartford, Connecticut area has improved over the last two years. A national real estate services company reported that the overall vacancy rate in the greater Hartford industrial market decreased from 12.3% at the end of 2014 to 9.2% at the end of 2016, with approximately 1.0 million square feet of net absorption in 2016. The Hartford office/flex market remained weak in 2016, with a national real estate services company reporting that the overall vacancy rate has remained at approximately 16% over the past two years, with vacancy in the north submarket of Hartford at approximately 21% over the past two years. Griffin's office/flex space was approximately 13% of Griffin's total square footage as of November 30, 2016. Griffin expects that its office/flex buildings will continue to become a smaller percentage of its total real estate portfolio as Griffin expects to focus on the growth of its industrial/warehouse building portfolio either through acquisition of fully or partially leased buildings, development of buildings on land currently owned or to be acquired or both. The real estate market for industrial/warehouse space in the Lehigh Valley has experienced strong growth and leasing activity during the past two years. The vacancy rate of Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse properties as reported by a national real estate services company was 5.2% at the end of the 2016, with a net absorption of approximately 7.6 million square feet in 2016. There is no guarantee that an active or strong real estate market or an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants will result in leasing space that was vacant as of November 30, 2016.\nGriffin's revenue from property sales increased to approximately $4.4 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed one property sale of approximately 29 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center (the Griffin Center Land Sale\u201d) for approximately $3.8 million in cash and a pretax gain of approximately $3.2 million. In fiscal 2016, in addition to the Griffin Center Land Sale, Griffin recognized revenue of approximately $0.6 million and a gain of approximately $0.4 million from the sale of approximately 90 acres of undeveloped land in Windsor, Connecticut (the Windsor Land Sale\u201d) that closed in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2013 ( fiscal 2013\u201d). Under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin is required to construct roadways to connect the land sold to existing town roadways. Accordingly, because of Griffin's continuing involvement with the land that was sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method. From the closing of the Windsor Land Sale in fiscal 2013 through November 30, 2016, Griffin has recognized approximately $8.8 million of\nrevenue from the Windsor Land Sale, reflecting approximately 99% of the total revenue to be recognized from such sale. The balance of the revenue from the Windsor Land Sale, approximately $0.1 million, will be recognized as the remaining costs, expected to be less than $0.1 million, of the required roadway construction are incurred, which is expected to be in fiscal 2017. While management has used its best estimates, based on industry knowledge and experience, in projecting the total costs of the required roadways being constructed, increases or decreases in future costs as compared with current estimated amounts would reduce or increase the gain recognized in future periods.\nThe approximately $3.5 million of revenue from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflected: (a) approximately $2.5 million from the recognition of revenue related to the Windsor Land Sale; (b) approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia; and (c) $0.4 million from the retention of a deposit (the Florida Farm Deposit\u201d) related to the sale of the Florida Farm, which did not close. Griffin received the Florida Farm Deposit in fiscal 2015 from the tenant that leased the Florida Farm at that time in connection with the tenant giving notice to Griffin that it was exercising its option under the lease to purchase the Florida Farm. The tenant subsequently notified Griffin that it would not close on the purchase and Griffin retained the Florida Farm Deposit and entered into an agreement with the tenant to extend its lease through April 30, 2016. Property sales occur periodically, and changes in revenue from year to year from those transactions may not be indicative of any trends in Griffin's real estate business.\nOperating expenses of rental properties decreased to approximately $8.2 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $8.4 million in fiscal 2015. The slight decrease of approximately $0.2 million in operating expenses of rental properties in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects decreases of approximately $0.4 million in snow removal expenses, due to less severe winter weather in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015, and approximately $0.3 million in utility expenses, partially offset by operating expense increases of approximately $0.3 million at 5220 Jaindl, which was in service for the entire year in fiscal 2016 versus three months in fiscal 2015, approximately $0.1 million of operating expenses at 5210 Jaindl, which was placed in service in fiscal 2016, and approximately $0.1 million for real estate taxes.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $1.1 million in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects increases in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.6 million related to 5220 Jaindl, which was in service for the entire year in fiscal 2016 versus three months in fiscal 2015, approximately $0.2 million related to 5210 Jaindl, which was placed in service in fiscal 2016, and approximately $0.5 million for tenant improvements related to new leases, offset by lower depreciation expense of approximately $0.2 million due to assets becoming fully depreciated.\nGriffin's general and administrative expenses increased to approximately $7.4 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $7.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.3 million in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects an increase of approximately $0.2 million related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan and approximately $0.1 million for an increase in incentive compensation expense. The expense increase related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan reflects the effect of higher stock market performance on participant balances in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, that resulted in a greater increase in Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan liability in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in incentive compensation expense reflects Griffin's improved results in fiscal 2016 with regards to profit from leasing activities and gain on property sales as measured under Griffin's incentive compensation plan.\nGriffin's interest expense increased to approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.8 million in interest expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects approximately $0.5 million less interest capitalized in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015 and an increase in interest expense of approximately $0.4 million due to the increase in the amount of nonrecourse mortgage loans in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The lower amount of capitalized interest in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects the higher amount of construction activity in fiscal 2015 than fiscal 2016. The increase in nonrecourse mortgage loans in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects borrowings completed in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter that were outstanding for the entire year in fiscal 2016, a new borrowing in fiscal 2016 on 5210 Jaindl, and adding a previously unleveraged NE Tradeport building to a mortgage on several other NE Tradeport buildings in fiscal 2016.\nGriffin's income tax provision increased to approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.3 million reflects approximately $0.2 million as a result of the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015 and approximately $0.1 million related to decreases in the valuation of certain state income tax benefits in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, Griffin's income tax provision included a charge of approximately $0.2 million for the reduction of the expected realization rate of tax benefits from Connecticut state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a change in Connecticut tax law, effective for Griffin beginning in fiscal 2016, that limits the future usage of loss carryforwards to 50% of taxable income. In fiscal 2015, Griffin's income tax provision included a charge of approximately $0.1 million for the reduction of the expected realization rate of tax benefits from certain state net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences as a result of changes in the expected utilization of such benefits. Griffin's effective income tax rate increased to 56.1% in fiscal 2016 from 47.2% in fiscal 2015. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects the effect in fiscal 2016 of a higher charge related to the reduction of certain state tax benefits.\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nTotal revenue increased to approximately $28.1 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $24.2 million in fiscal 2014, reflecting an increase of approximately $4.1 million in rental revenue, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in revenue from property sales. Rental revenue increased to approximately $24.6 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $20.5 million in fiscal 2014 principally due to an increase in space leased in Griffin's buildings. The increase in rental revenue principally reflected: (a) an increase of approximately $2.9 million of rental revenue from leasing previously vacant space; (b) approximately $1.4 million of rental revenue from leasing space in two Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings that were placed in service in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015; (c) an increase of approximately $0.4 million of rental revenue in connection with agreements to terminate leases before their scheduled termination dates; and (d) an increase in rental revenue of approximately $0.3 million from all other leases; partially offset by (e) a decrease of approximately $0.9 million of rental revenue from leases that expired and were not renewed.\nA summary of the square footage of the buildings in Griffin's real estate portfolio is as follows:\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,045,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,706,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,764,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,317,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in total square footage as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 reflected 5220 Jaindl, the approximately 280,000 square foot industrial building completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter. 5220 Jaindl, located in the Lehigh Valley, was the first of two industrial buildings constructed on Lehigh Valley Tradeport II, the approximately 50 acre parcel of undeveloped land acquired mostly in fiscal 2013.\nThe net increase of approximately 389,000 square feet in space leased as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 reflects leasing the entire approximately 280,000 square feet of 5220 Jaindl and several new leases in other buildings aggregating approximately 191,000 square feet of previously vacant space, partially offset by several leases aggregating approximately 52,000 square feet that expired and were not renewed and a lease of approximately 31,000 square feet that was terminated prior to its scheduled expiration date for which Griffin received a payment of approximately $0.2 million. The leasing of 5220 Jaindl reflected a five year lease for approximately 196,000 square feet that became effective at the start of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter. In November 2015, the tenant in 5220 Jaindl exercised its option to lease the balance of the building. Rental revenue on the additional space started in fiscal 2016. Most of the approximately 191,000 square feet of previously vacant space that was leased in fiscal 2015 was industrial/warehouse space in NE Tradeport. Griffin also extended several leases aggregating approximately 397,000 square feet that included approximately 326,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space in NE Tradeport and approximately 71,000 square feet of office/flex space in Griffin Center and Griffin Center South. Subsequent to November 30, 2015, Griffin leased approximately 102,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch. Had that lease been completed as of November 30, 2015, the percentage of square footage leased in Griffin's buildings as of that date would have been 92%.\nActivity by prospective tenants where Griffin's Connecticut properties are located (the north submarket of Hartford) was muted in fiscal 2014; however, there was an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants, mostly for\nindustrial/warehouse space, in the latter part of fiscal 2014 that continued through fiscal 2015. Leasing activity in the Lehigh Valley in fiscal 2015 was somewhat slower than the previous year; however, the reported overall vacancy rate there continued to remain low in fiscal 2015.\nRevenue from property sales decreased to approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2014. Revenue from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflects: (a) the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale; (b) approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia; and (c) $0.4 million from the Florida Farm Deposit (see below). Property sales occur periodically, and changes in revenue from year to year from those transactions may not be indicative of any trends in Griffin's real estate business.\nUnder the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin is required to construct roadways that will connect the land sold to existing town roadways. Accordingly, because of Griffin's continuing involvement with the land that was sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Through November 30, 2015, Griffin had recognized approximately $8.3 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale.\nIn the fiscal 2015 third quarter, Griffin received the Florida Farm Deposit from the tenant that leased the Florida Farm in connection with the tenant giving notice to Griffin at that time that it was exercising its option under the lease to purchase the Florida Farm. The tenant subsequently notified Griffin that it would not close on the purchase of the Florida Farm. Griffin retained the Florida Farm Deposit and entered into an agreement with the tenant to extend the lease of the Florida Farm through April 30, 2016.\nOperating expenses of rental properties increased to approximately $8.4 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $7.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating expenses of rental properties of approximately $0.6 million was due to a full year of operating expenses of 4270 Fritch in fiscal 2015 as compared to a partial year of such expenses in fiscal 2014, as that building was placed in service in the fiscal 2014 third quarter, and operating expenses of 5220 Jaindl, which was placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter. Operating expenses of all other rental properties were essentially unchanged in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $6.7 million in fiscal 2014. The increase of approximately $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects approximately $0.4 million related to 4270 Fritch, approximately $0.2 million related to 5220 Jaindl and an increase of approximately $0.3 million related to building improvements and tenant improvements in Griffin's other properties.\nGriffin's general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged at approximately $7.1 million in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. Increases of approximately $0.3 million of incentive compensation expense and approximately $0.2 million in expenses in real estate taxes and other expenses related to Griffin's undeveloped land, which are included in general and administrative expenses, were essentially offset by decreases of approximately $0.2 million in expenses related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, approximately $0.2 million in audit fee expenses and approximately $0.1 million in all other general and administrative expenses. The lower expense related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan reflects lower stock market performance in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, that resulted in a lower increase on participant balances in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nGriffin's interest expense increased to approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2014. An increase in interest expense of approximately $0.5 million as a result of new mortgage loans in fiscal 2015 was partially offset by decreases in interest expense of approximately $0.2 million due to a higher amount of interest capitalized in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and approximately $0.1 million from refinancing a mortgage loan on three NE Tradeport buildings at a lower interest rate in fiscal 2015. The increase in the amount of interest capitalized in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 principally reflects an increase in construction activities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, including the construction of 5220 Jaindl, which was completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter.\nInvestment income decreased to approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $0.3 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease of approximately $0.1 million principally reflects lower interest income from the amortization\nof the discount on the note receivable from Monrovia related to the Imperial Sale that closed in January 2014. The note receivable from Monrovia was fully paid on June 1, 2015.\nIn fiscal 2014, Griffin reported an approximately $0.3 million gain from the sale of 500,000 shares of its common stock in Centaur Media for cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. Griffin did not sell any of its Centaur Media common stock in fiscal 2015. Griffin holds 1,952,462 shares of Centaur Media common stock and has not sold any Centaur Media common stock subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014. Management expects that it will continue to sell its Centaur Media common stock when it believes that sales terms are favorable. Also in fiscal 2014, Griffin incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $0.1 million related to the refinancing of two mortgage loans.\nGriffin's effective income tax rate was 47.2% in fiscal 2015 as compared to 8.3% in fiscal 2014. The fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate reflects the federal statutory rate of 35% and state income taxes, including adjustments to the expected realization rate that certain state tax benefits will provide to Griffin in future years. To the extent that actual results differ from current projections, the projected realization rate would be different than the rate presently being used. In fiscal 2014 there was an income tax provision as compared to a pretax loss because the effect of reductions to certain state income tax benefits exceeded the federal income tax benefit, resulting in an overall income tax provision. The reductions to certain state income tax benefits were based on management's projections of the expected realization rate that those state tax benefits will provide to Griffin.\nIncome from discontinued operations of approximately $0.1 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2014 reflected approximately $0.3 million, net of tax, for the effect of the termination of Griffin's postretirement benefits program and reclassification of actuarial gains previously reflected in other comprehensive income into net income, partially offset by approximately $0.2 million, net of tax, for the loss from the growing operations of the landscape nursery business through the date of the Imperial Sale. As substantially all of the former participants in Griffin's postretirement benefits program had been employed in the growing operations of the landscape nursery business that was reported as a discontinued operation, the reclassification of the actuarial gains is mostly included in the results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2014.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nGriffin does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $7.2 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $13.0 million in fiscal 2015. The approximately $5.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects a decrease of approximately $6.8 million of cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.1 million in cash generated from the increase in net income as adjusted for noncash expenses and credits and gain on sale of properties in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, which principally reflects the increase in profit from leasing activities in fiscal 2016, driven by the increase in rental revenue.\nThe decrease in cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects fiscal 2016 having an approximately $0.7 million decrease in cash from the change in deferred revenue as compared to an approximately $4.9 million increase in cash from the change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 having an approximately $0.1 million increase in cash from the change in other assets as compared to an approximately $1.1 million increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015. The change in deferred revenue of approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 principally reflects the recognition of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 principally reflects approximately $6.4 million of cash received from the tenant in 758 Rainbow for building and tenant improvements that is being recognized as additional rental revenue over the lease term, offset by the reduction of deferred revenue from the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The cash received by Griffin from the tenant in fiscal 2015 was related to building and tenant improvements in connection with a ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015 principally reflected approximately $0.9 million from a reduction in lease receivables.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately $13.0 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $5.4 million in fiscal 2014. The approximately $7.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, principally reflects: (a) an increase of approximately $4.6 million of cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014; and (b) an increase of approximately $3.0 million in cash generated from continuing operations, including adjustments to reconcile income (loss) from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations. The increase in cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, principally reflects approximately $4.9 million of cash from an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 as compared to approximately $3.0 million of cash in fiscal 2014 and approximately $1.1 million of cash from a change in other assets in fiscal 2015 as compared to an approximately $0.6 million decrease in cash in fiscal 2014. The change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 includes cash of approximately $6.4 million received from the tenant in 758 Rainbow for building and tenant improvements that is being recognized as additional rental revenue over the lease term, offset principally by the reduction of deferred revenue from the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015 principally reflects approximately $0.9 million from a reduction in lease receivables and approximately $0.4 million from a reduction in escrows related to Griffin's mortgage loans.\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $16.6 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $29.7 million in fiscal 2015 and approximately $3.9 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects cash payments of approximately $15.7 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $0.9 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses. The cash spent on deferred leasing costs and other in fiscal 2016 principally reflects lease commissions paid to real estate brokers for new leases. The approximately $3.5 million of proceeds, net of transaction expenses, received from the Griffin Center Land Sale were placed in escrow for potential acquisition of a replacement property in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2016 reflect the following:\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew building construction (including site work)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant and building improvements related to leasing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5.4 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment costs and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash payments in fiscal 2016 for new building construction reflect the construction, on speculation, of 5210 Jaindl, which was started in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and completed in fiscal 2016. Through November 30, 2016, Griffin has made total cash payments of approximately $12.0 million for the direct site work and building shell for 5210 Jaindl. Cash payments in fiscal 2016 for tenant and building improvements principally reflect tenant improvement work related to leases signed in the latter part of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. The cash spent on development costs and infrastructure improvements in fiscal 2016 principally reflects road improvements related to the Windsor Land Sale.\nThe net cash used in investing activities of approximately $29.7 million in fiscal 2015 reflects cash payments of approximately $31.2 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $1.0 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses, partially offset by $1.5 million of cash received from the second and final payment under the note receivable from Monrovia and approximately $1.0 million of cash proceeds from property sales.\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2015 reflect the following:\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew building construction (including site work)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant and building improvements related to leasing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.4 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment costs and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2015 cash payments for new building construction, including site work, principally reflected the construction, on speculation, of 5220 Jaindl and the start of site work for 5210 Jaindl. The fiscal 2015 cash payments for tenant and building improvements related to leasing include approximately $7.8 million for improvements in connection with the ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow and approximately $2.9 million of improvements at 5220 Jaindl.\nThe cash payments for development costs and infrastructure improvements primarily reflected ongoing road construction and other offsite improvements required under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale.\nProceeds from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflect approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia and approximately $0.4 million from the deposit retained on the sale of the Florida Farm that did not close.\nThe net cash used in investing activities of approximately $3.9 million in fiscal 2014 reflects cash payments of approximately $15.6 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $1.2 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses, substantially offset by: (a) cash proceeds of approximately $8.9 million from the Windsor Land Sale that were returned from escrow; (b) cash proceeds of $2.75 million received from the first payment under the note receivable from Monrovia; (c) cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million from sales of Centaur Media common stock; (d) cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million, net of expenses, from property sales; and (e) cash proceeds of approximately $0.2 million from the Imperial Sale. At the closing of the Windsor Land Sale in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter, the proceeds of approximately $8.9 million were placed in escrow for a potential acquisition of a replacement property in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As Griffin did not acquire a replacement property, the cash proceeds were returned to Griffin in fiscal 2014.\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2014 reflect the following:\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew building construction (including site work)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment costs and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant and building improvements related to leasing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.8 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal 2014 cash payments for new building construction principally reflected the completion of construction of 4270 Fritch. Cash payments for development costs and infrastructure improvements in fiscal 2014 included approximately $2.0 million for site work on a residential project and approximately $1.0 million for road construction required under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $15.8 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $18.0 million in fiscal 2015 and approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects $45.5 million of proceeds from new mortgage debt (see below) and $0.6 million of mortgage proceeds released from escrow, partially offset by: (a) approximately $24.8 million of principal payments on mortgage loans; (b) approximately $3.4 million paid for the repurchase of common stock (see below); (c) a payment of approximately $1.5 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2016; and (d) approximately $0.6 million of payments for debt issuance costs. The principal payments on mortgage loans include approximately $21.1 million for the repayment of two mortgage loans that were refinanced (see below), approximately $2.7 million of recurring principal payments and a $1.0 million principal repayment from mortgage proceeds that had been held in escrow.\nThe net cash of approximately $18.0 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected net proceeds of approximately $40.4 million from three mortgage loans (see below) and approximately $0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (a) approximately $20.1 million of payments of principal on Griffin's mortgage loans; (b) a payment of approximately $1.0 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2015; (c) approximately $0.8 million of payments for debt issuance costs related to the mortgage loans completed in fiscal 2015; and (d) approximately $0.6 million of mortgage proceeds placed in escrow. The principal payments on mortgage loans included approximately $17.9 million for the repayment of a mortgage loan that was refinanced (see below) and approximately $2.2 million of recurring principal payments.\nThe net cash of approximately $1.4 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2014 reflected proceeds of approximately $5.5 million from a mortgage loan and approximately $0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (a) approximately $2.0 million for recurring payments of principal on Griffin's mortgage loans; (b) a payment of approximately $1.0 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2014; (c) $1.0 million of mortgage proceeds placed in escrow; and (d) approximately $0.1 million of payments for debt issuance costs.\nOn November 17, 2016, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage (the 2016 Webster Mortgage\u201d) for approximately $26.7 million. The 2016 Webster Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage with Webster Bank, N.A. ( Webster\u201d) which was due on September 1, 2025 and was collateralized by 5220 Jaindl (see below). The 2016 Webster Mortgage is collateralized by the approximately 280,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building, 5220 Jaindl, along with 5210 Jaindl, the adjacent approximately 252,000 square foot industrial building. Griffin received net proceeds of $13.0 million (before transaction costs), net of approximately $13.7 million used to refinance the existing mortgage with Webster. The 2016 Webster Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2016 Webster Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.70%. At the time the 2016 Webster Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Webster that, combined with two existing swap agreements with Webster, effectively fixes the rate of the 2016 Webster Mortgage at 3.79% over the mortgage loan's ten year term.\nOn September 1, 2015, Griffin closed on a $14.1 million nonrecourse mortgage loan (the Webster Mortgage Loan\u201d) with Webster. The Webster Mortgage Loan was collateralized by 5220 Jaindl. At closing, Griffin received cash proceeds from the Webster Mortgage Loan (before transaction costs) of $11.5 million. Subsequent to the closing of this loan, the tenant that was leasing approximately 196,000 square feet in 5220 Jaindl exercised its option to lease the balance of the building and Webster advanced the balance of the mortgage loan proceeds ($2.6 million) to Griffin on December 10, 2015. The Webster Mortgage Loan had a floating interest rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.65%, but Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Webster Bank at closing to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.77% over the loan term on the loan proceeds received at closing. At the time Griffin received the additional proceeds of $2.6 million, Griffin entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with Webster to effectively fix the interest rate on those loan proceeds at 3.67% for the balance of the term of the loan.\nOn April 26, 2016, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage (the 2016 PUB Mortgage\u201d) with People's United Bank, N.A. ( PUB\u201d) and received mortgage proceeds of $14.35 million, before transaction costs. The 2016 PUB Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage (the 2009 PUB Mortgage\u201d) with PUB that was due on August 1, 2019 and was collateralized by four of Griffin's NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings totaling approximately 240,000 square feet (14, 15, 16 and 40 International Drive). The 2009 PUB Mortgage had a balance of approximately $7.4 million at the time of the refinancing and a floating interest rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 3.08%. Griffin had entered into an interest rate swap agreement with PUB to effectively fix the rate on the 2009 PUB Mortgage at 6.58% for the term of that loan. The 2016 PUB Mortgage is collateralized by the same four properties as the 2009 PUB Mortgage along with another approximately 98,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building (35 International Drive) in NE Tradeport. At the closing of the 2016 PUB Mortgage, Griffin used a portion of the proceeds to repay the 2009 PUB Mortgage. The 2016 PUB Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2016 PUB Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.0%. At the time the 2016 PUB Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with PUB that, combined with the existing interest rate swap agreement with PUB, effectively fixes the interest rate of the 2016 PUB Mortgage at 4.17% over the loan term. The terms of the 2016 PUB Mortgage require that if either the tenant that leases approximately 58,000 square feet in 40 International Drive or the tenant that leases approximately 40,000 square feet in 14 International Drive does not extend its respective lease when it expires in fiscal 2021, a subsidiary of Griffin will enter into a master lease of the vacated space. The master lease would be guaranteed by Griffin and be in effect until either the space is re-leased to a new tenant or the due date of the 2016 PUB Mortgage Loan, whichever occurs first.\nOn December 31, 2014, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage loan (the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage\u201d) on 4275 Fritch Drive ( 4275 Fritch\u201d) with First Niagara Bank, which was subsequently acquired by KeyBank. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage loan on 4275 Fritch and added 4270 Fritch to the collateral. Griffin received mortgage proceeds of approximately $10.9 million (before transaction costs) in addition to approximately $8.9 million used to refinance the existing mortgage on 4275 Fritch. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage is collateralized by 4270 Fritch, an approximately 303,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building, and 4275 Fritch, an adjacent approximately 228,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building. At the time of the mortgage closing, approximately 201,000 square feet of 4270 Fritch was leased. On December 11, 2015, Griffin received additional mortgage proceeds of $1.85 million (the KeyBank Earn-Out\u201d) when the remaining vacant space of approximately 102,000 square feet was leased. Griffin agreed that it would enter into a master lease with its subsidiaries that own 4270 Fritch and 4275 Fritch in order to maintain a minimum net rent equal to the debt service on the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage. The master lease would be co-terminus with the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly\nprincipal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.95%. At the time the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, combined with an existing interest rate swap agreement, effectively fixed the rate of the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage at 4.43% over the mortgage loan's ten year term. At the time the KeyBank Earn-Out was received, Griffin entered into another interest rate swap agreement for a notional principal amount of $1.85 million to fix the interest rate on the KeyBank Earn-Out at 3.88%. The combination of the three interest rate swap agreements effectively fixes the interest rate on the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage at 4.39% over the remainder of the mortgage loan's ten year term.\nOn July 29, 2015, a subsidiary of Griffin closed on a new $18.0 million nonrecourse mortgage loan (the 40|86 Mortgage Loan\u201d) with 40|86 Mortgage Capital, Inc. The 40|86 Mortgage Loan is collateralized by three industrial buildings in NE Tradeport (75 International Drive, 754 and 758 Rainbow Road) aggregating approximately 392,000 square feet, has a fixed interest rate of 4.33% and a fifteen year term, with payments based on a thirty year amortization schedule. At closing, Griffin received cash proceeds from the 40|86 Mortgage Loan (before financing costs) of approximately $14.9 million, which were used in refinancing the maturing mortgage that had a principal balance of approximately $17.9 million and an interest rate of 5.73%. The remaining approximately $3.1 million of mortgage proceeds were deposited into escrow. As per the terms of the 40|86 Mortgage Loan, $2.5 million of the escrowed proceeds were released to Griffin in fiscal 2015 when the tenant that was leasing approximately 88,000 square feet on a month-to-month basis in 754 Rainbow entered into a long-term lease for that space and the remaining $0.6 million of escrowed proceeds were released to Griffin in fiscal 2016 when tenant improvements for the full building tenant in 758 Rainbow was completed.\nOn July 22, 2016, Griffin entered into a two-year extension to its revolving credit line with Webster (the Webster Credit Line\u201d) that was scheduled to expire on August 1, 2016. The terms of the extension increased the amount of the credit line from $12.5 million to $15.0 million and Griffin has the option to further extend the credit line for an additional year provided there is no default at the time such extension is requested. The interest rate on the credit line extension remained at the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.75% and the collateral for the Webster Credit Line, Griffin's eight single-story office/flex buildings aggregating approximately 217,000 square feet in Griffin Center South, an approximately 48,000 square foot single-story office building in Griffin Center, and an approximately 18,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Griffin Center South also remained the same. There have been no borrowings under the Webster Credit Line since its inception, however, the Webster Credit Line does secure certain unused standby letters of credit aggregating approximately $1.8 million that are related to Griffin's development activities.\nOn March 31, 2016, Griffin's Board of Directors authorized a program under which Griffin may repurchase up to $5.0 million in outstanding shares of its common stock over a twelve month period in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not obligate Griffin to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at management's discretion. In fiscal 2016, Griffin repurchased 105,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $3.4 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, Griffin repurchased an additional 19,173 shares of its common stock for approximately $0.6 million, resulting in approximately $1.0 million available for additional stock repurchases under the current repurchase program.\nGriffin's payments (including principal and interest) under contractual obligations as of November 30, 2016 are as follows:\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue Within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue From\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue From\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue in More\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThan 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n147.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n92.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevolving Line of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase Obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n154.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n97.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 35: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nIncludes obligations principally related to the development of Griffin's real estate assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 36: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nReflects the liability for Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan.

The buyer may extend the option period up to three years upon payment of additional option fees. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, the buyer paid Griffin to extend the option period. The land subject to the Option Agreement does not have any of the approvals that would be required for the buyer's planned use of the land. A closing on the land sale contemplated by the Option Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including the buyer securing contracts under a competitive bidding process that would require changes in the use of the land and obtaining local and state approvals for that planned use. There is no guarantee that the sale of undeveloped land as contemplated under the Option Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nOn March 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase (the East Allen Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire an approximately 31 acre site in East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania for development of an industrial/warehouse building. Subsequently, Griffin exercised its right to terminate the East Allen Purchase Agreement based on its due diligence findings. After the East Allen Purchase Agreement was terminated, Griffin has continued negotiations with the seller to reach a new agreement. Completion of a new purchase agreement is uncertain at this time.\nOn May 4, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase, as amended (the Macungie Purchase Agreement\u201d), to acquire, for a purchase price of $1.8 million, an approximately 14 acre site in Upper Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania for development of an approximately 134,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building. A closing on the land acquisition contemplated by the Macungie Purchase Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including Griffin obtaining all governmental approvals for its planned development of the land that would be acquired. There is no guarantee that the land acquisition as contemplated under the Macungie Purchase Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nOn December 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an agreement to sell approximately 67 acres of its undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing for approximately $10.25 million. Completion of this transaction is subject to a number of factors, including the buyer obtaining all necessary final permits from governmental authorities for development plans of the site it would acquire and the buyer receiving municipal and state economic development incentives it deems adequate. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nOn January 20, 2017, Griffin agreed to terms on a nonrecourse mortgage loan of up to $12.0 million on two NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 275,000 square feet. Completion of this proposed new mortgage loan is subject to a number of contingencies, including the entry into a definitive loan agreement. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nIn the near-term, Griffin plans to continue to invest in its real estate business, including the construction of additional buildings on its undeveloped land, expenditures for tenant improvements as new leases are signed,\ninfrastructure improvements required for future development of its real estate holdings and the potential acquisition of additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels in New England, the Mid-Atlantic states and other areas to expand the industrial/warehouse portion of its real estate portfolio. Real estate acquisitions may or may not occur based on many factors, including real estate pricing. Griffin may commence speculative construction projects on its undeveloped land that is either currently owned or acquired in the future if it believes market conditions are favorable for such development. Griffin may also construct a build-to-suit facility on its undeveloped land if lease terms are favorable.\nAs of November 30, 2016, Griffin had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24.7 million. Management believes that its cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2016, cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity under its $15.0 million revolving credit agreement with Webster will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, the continued investment in real estate assets, completion of the acquisition of undeveloped land in Upper Macungie Township, the repurchase of its common stock under the stock repurchase program currently in place, and the payment of dividends on its common stock, when and if declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next twelve months. Griffin may also continue to seek additional financing secured by nonrecourse mortgage loans on its properties. Griffin's real estate portfolio currently includes four Connecticut buildings aggregating approximately 314,000 square feet that are not mortgaged, however, Griffin has agreed to terms for a nonrecourse mortgage loan on two of those buildings that combined are approximately 275,000 square feet. Completion of this proposed new mortgage loan is subject to a number of contingencies, including the entry into a definitive loan agreement. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nForward-Looking Information\nThe above information in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, Griffin's expectations regarding the leasing of currently vacant space, the acquisition of additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels, the commencement of speculative construction, the ability to obtain mortgage financing on Griffin's unleveraged properties, completion of the acquisition of land in Upper Macungie Township, completion of a new agreement to acquire land in East Allen Township, completion of the sale of approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury, completion of the sale of approximately 67 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing, completion of a mortgage loan on two NE Tradeport buildings aggregating approximately 275,000 square feet, Griffin's anticipated future liquidity, and other statements with the words believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d expects\u201d or similar expressions. Although Griffin believes that its plans, intentions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. The forward-looking statements made herein are based on assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by Griffin as of the date hereof, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of Griffin. Griffin's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report.", "item_7_truncated": "The net cash used in investing activities of approximately $3.9 million in fiscal 2014 reflects cash payments of approximately $15.6 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $1.2 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses, substantially offset by: (a) cash proceeds of approximately $8.9 million from the Windsor Land Sale that were returned from escrow; (b) cash proceeds of $2.75 million received from the first payment under the note receivable from Monrovia; (c) cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million from sales of Centaur Media common stock; (d) cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million, net of expenses, from property sales; and (e) cash proceeds of approximately $0.2 million from the Imperial Sale. At the closing of the Windsor Land Sale in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter, the proceeds of approximately $8.9 million were placed in escrow for a potential acquisition of a replacement property in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As Griffin did not acquire a replacement property, the cash proceeds were returned to Griffin in fiscal 2014.\nThe net increase of approximately 360,000 square feet leased as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, reflects the approximately 252,000 square feet leased at 5210 Jaindl and several new leases aggregating approximately 240,000 square feet in other buildings, partially offset by several leases aggregating approximately 132,000 square feet that expired. Included in the approximately 240,000 square feet of new leasing in fiscal 2016 are a lease of approximately 101,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch Drive ( 4270 Fritch\u201d), one of Griffin's other industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley, a full building lease of 25 International Drive ( 25 International\u201d), an approximately 57,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in New England Tradeport ( NE Tradeport\u201d), Griffin's industrial park in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut, a full building lease of an approximately 31,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Bloomfield, Connecticut, and a lease of approximately 16,000 square feet in a single story office building in Griffin Center. The new lease of 25 International replaced a lease that expired earlier in the year. The tenant of the expired lease had, in fiscal 2014, entered into a ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow Road ( 758 Rainbow\u201d), an approximately 138,000 square foot building in NE Tradeport, while remaining in 25 International during its period of transition to the larger facility.\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue Within\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue From\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue From\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nDue in More\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nThan 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n(in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nMortgage Loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n147.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n13.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.0 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n92.9 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nRevolving Line of Credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOperating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.1 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n0.6 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nPurchase Obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n1.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n4.3 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n154.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n15.7 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n24.5 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n16.2 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n97.8 \t\t\t\t </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGriffin's effective income tax rate was 47.2% in fiscal 2015 as compared to 8.3% in fiscal 2014. The fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate reflects the federal statutory rate of 35% and state income taxes, including adjustments to the expected realization rate that certain state tax benefits will provide to Griffin in future years. To the extent that actual results differ from current projections, the projected realization rate would be different than the rate presently being used. In fiscal 2014 there was an income tax provision as compared to a pretax loss because the effect of reductions to certain state income tax benefits exceeded the federal income tax benefit, resulting in an overall income tax provision. The reductions to certain state income tax benefits were based on management's projections of the expected realization rate that those state tax benefits will provide to Griffin.\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew building construction (including site work)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n9.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant and building improvements related to leasing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n5.4 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment costs and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn September 1, 2015, Griffin closed on a $14.1 million nonrecourse mortgage loan (the Webster Mortgage Loan\u201d) with Webster. The Webster Mortgage Loan was collateralized by 5220 Jaindl. At closing, Griffin received cash proceeds from the Webster Mortgage Loan (before transaction costs) of $11.5 million. Subsequent to the closing of this loan, the tenant that was leasing approximately 196,000 square feet in 5220 Jaindl exercised its option to lease the balance of the building and Webster advanced the balance of the mortgage loan proceeds ($2.6 million) to Griffin on December 10, 2015. The Webster Mortgage Loan had a floating interest rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.65%, but Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Webster Bank at closing to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.77% over the loan term on the loan proceeds received at closing. At the time Griffin received the additional proceeds of $2.6 million, Griffin entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with Webster to effectively fix the interest rate on those loan proceeds at 3.67% for the balance of the term of the loan.\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,045,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,706,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,764,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,317,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n84%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue from property sales decreased to approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2014. Revenue from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflects: (a) the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale; (b) approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia; and (c) $0.4 million from the Florida Farm Deposit (see below). Property sales occur periodically, and changes in revenue from year to year from those transactions may not be indicative of any trends in Griffin's real estate business.\nForward-Looking Information\nof the discount on the note receivable from Monrovia related to the Imperial Sale that closed in January 2014. The note receivable from Monrovia was fully paid on June 1, 2015.\nAll of Griffin's Connecticut industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings are in the north submarket of Hartford. The real estate market for industrial/warehouse space in the Hartford, Connecticut area has improved over the last two years. A national real estate services company reported that the overall vacancy rate in the greater Hartford industrial market decreased from 12.3% at the end of 2014 to 9.2% at the end of 2016, with approximately 1.0 million square feet of net absorption in 2016. The Hartford office/flex market remained weak in 2016, with a national real estate services company reporting that the overall vacancy rate has remained at approximately 16% over the past two years, with vacancy in the north submarket of Hartford at approximately 21% over the past two years. Griffin's office/flex space was approximately 13% of Griffin's total square footage as of November 30, 2016. Griffin expects that its office/flex buildings will continue to become a smaller percentage of its total real estate portfolio as Griffin expects to focus on the growth of its industrial/warehouse building portfolio either through acquisition of fully or partially leased buildings, development of buildings on land currently owned or to be acquired or both. The real estate market for industrial/warehouse space in the Lehigh Valley has experienced strong growth and leasing activity during the past two years. The vacancy rate of Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse properties as reported by a national real estate services company was 5.2% at the end of the 2016, with a net absorption of approximately 7.6 million square feet in 2016. There is no guarantee that an active or strong real estate market or an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants will result in leasing space that was vacant as of November 30, 2016.\nTable 33: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew building construction (including site work)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n10.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment costs and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n3.0 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant and building improvements related to leasing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n1.8 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.6 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn April 26, 2016, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage (the 2016 PUB Mortgage\u201d) with People's United Bank, N.A. ( PUB\u201d) and received mortgage proceeds of $14.35 million, before transaction costs. The 2016 PUB Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage (the 2009 PUB Mortgage\u201d) with PUB that was due on August 1, 2019 and was collateralized by four of Griffin's NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings totaling approximately 240,000 square feet (14, 15, 16 and 40 International Drive). The 2009 PUB Mortgage had a balance of approximately $7.4 million at the time of the refinancing and a floating interest rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 3.08%. Griffin had entered into an interest rate swap agreement with PUB to effectively fix the rate on the 2009 PUB Mortgage at 6.58% for the term of that loan. The 2016 PUB Mortgage is collateralized by the same four properties as the 2009 PUB Mortgage along with another approximately 98,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building (35 International Drive) in NE Tradeport. At the closing of the 2016 PUB Mortgage, Griffin used a portion of the proceeds to repay the 2009 PUB Mortgage. The 2016 PUB Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2016 PUB Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.0%. At the time the 2016 PUB Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with PUB that, combined with the existing interest rate swap agreement with PUB, effectively fixes the interest rate of the 2016 PUB Mortgage at 4.17% over the loan term. The terms of the 2016 PUB Mortgage require that if either the tenant that leases approximately 58,000 square feet in 40 International Drive or the tenant that leases approximately 40,000 square feet in 14 International Drive does not extend its respective lease when it expires in fiscal 2021, a subsidiary of Griffin will enter into a master lease of the vacated space. The master lease would be guaranteed by Griffin and be in effect until either the space is re-leased to a new tenant or the due date of the 2016 PUB Mortgage Loan, whichever occurs first.\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nSquare\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nPercentage\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nFootage\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\nLeased\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,297,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,066,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n93%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nAs of November 30, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n3,045,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n2,706,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n89%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe net cash of approximately $1.4 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2014 reflected proceeds of approximately $5.5 million from a mortgage loan and approximately $0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (a) approximately $2.0 million for recurring payments of principal on Griffin's mortgage loans; (b) a payment of approximately $1.0 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2014; (c) $1.0 million of mortgage proceeds placed in escrow; and (d) approximately $0.1 million of payments for debt issuance costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $1.1 million in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects increases in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.6 million related to 5220 Jaindl, which was in service for the entire year in fiscal 2016 versus three months in fiscal 2015, approximately $0.2 million related to 5210 Jaindl, which was placed in service in fiscal 2016, and approximately $0.5 million for tenant improvements related to new leases, offset by lower depreciation expense of approximately $0.2 million due to assets becoming fully depreciated.\nGriffin does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nNew building construction (including site work)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.5 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nTenant and building improvements related to leasing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n14.4 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nDevelopment costs and infrastructure improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n2.1 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nOther\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n$\n</td> <td>\n0.2 million\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock based compensation: Griffin determines stock based compensation based on the estimated fair values of stock options as determined on their grant dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In determining the estimated fair values of stock options issued, Griffin makes assumptions on expected volatility, risk free interest rates, expected option terms and dividend yields.\ninfrastructure improvements required for future development of its real estate holdings and the potential acquisition of additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels in New England, the Mid-Atlantic states and other areas to expand the industrial/warehouse portion of its real estate portfolio. Real estate acquisitions may or may not occur based on many factors, including real estate pricing. Griffin may commence speculative construction projects on its undeveloped land that is either currently owned or acquired in the future if it believes market conditions are favorable for such development. Griffin may also construct a build-to-suit facility on its undeveloped land if lease terms are favorable.\nIncome from discontinued operations of approximately $0.1 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2014 reflected approximately $0.3 million, net of tax, for the effect of the termination of Griffin's postretirement benefits program and reclassification of actuarial gains previously reflected in other comprehensive income into net income, partially offset by approximately $0.2 million, net of tax, for the loss from the growing operations of the landscape nursery business through the date of the Imperial Sale. As substantially all of the former participants in Griffin's postretirement benefits program had been employed in the growing operations of the landscape nursery business that was reported as a discontinued operation, the reclassification of the actuarial gains is mostly included in the results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2014.\nImpairment of long-lived assets: Griffin reviews annually, as well as when conditions may indicate, its long-lived assets to determine if there are any indications of impairment, such as a prolonged vacancy in one of Griffin's rental properties. If indications of impairment are present, Griffin evaluates the carrying value of the assets in relation to undiscounted cash flows or the estimated fair value of the underlying assets. Development costs that have been capitalized are reviewed periodically for future recoverability.\nGriffin's revenue from property sales increased to approximately $4.4 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed one property sale of approximately 29 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center (the Griffin Center Land Sale\u201d) for approximately $3.8 million in cash and a pretax gain of approximately $3.2 million. In fiscal 2016, in addition to the Griffin Center Land Sale, Griffin recognized revenue of approximately $0.6 million and a gain of approximately $0.4 million from the sale of approximately 90 acres of undeveloped land in Windsor, Connecticut (the Windsor Land Sale\u201d) that closed in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2013 ( fiscal 2013\u201d). Under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin is required to construct roadways to connect the land sold to existing town roadways. Accordingly, because of Griffin's continuing involvement with the land that was sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method. From the closing of the Windsor Land Sale in fiscal 2013 through November 30, 2016, Griffin has recognized approximately $8.8 million of\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nFiscal 2014 cash payments for new building construction principally reflected the completion of construction of 4270 Fritch. Cash payments for development costs and infrastructure improvements in fiscal 2014 included approximately $2.0 million for site work on a residential project and approximately $1.0 million for road construction required under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale.\nThe notes to Griffin's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Griffin's consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, because of the relative magnitude of Griffin's real estate assets, accounting methods and estimates related to those assets are critical to the preparation of Griffin's consolidated financial statements. Griffin uses accounting policies and methods under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The following are the critical accounting estimates and methods used by Griffin:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nOn March 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase (the East Allen Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire an approximately 31 acre site in East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania for development of an industrial/warehouse building. Subsequently, Griffin exercised its right to terminate the East Allen Purchase Agreement based on its due diligence findings. After the East Allen Purchase Agreement was terminated, Griffin has continued negotiations with the seller to reach a new agreement. Completion of a new purchase agreement is uncertain at this time.\nThe approximately $3.5 million of revenue from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflected: (a) approximately $2.5 million from the recognition of revenue related to the Windsor Land Sale; (b) approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia; and (c) $0.4 million from the retention of a deposit (the Florida Farm Deposit\u201d) related to the sale of the Florida Farm, which did not close. Griffin received the Florida Farm Deposit in fiscal 2015 from the tenant that leased the Florida Farm at that time in connection with the tenant giving notice to Griffin that it was exercising its option under the lease to purchase the Florida Farm. The tenant subsequently notified Griffin that it would not close on the purchase and Griffin retained the Florida Farm Deposit and entered into an agreement with the tenant to extend its lease through April 30, 2016. Property sales occur periodically, and changes in revenue from year to year from those transactions may not be indicative of any trends in Griffin's real estate business.\n (1) Includes obligations principally related to the development of Griffin's real estate assets. \nGriffin Industrial Realty, Inc. ( Griffin\u201d) is a real estate business principally engaged in developing, managing and leasing industrial/warehouse properties, and to a lesser extent, office/flex properties. Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin's core development and leasing strategy. Griffin seeks to add to its property portfolio through the acquisition and development of land or the purchase of buildings. Prior to May 13, 2015, Griffin was known as Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc. On May 13, 2015, Griffin changed its name to better reflect its ongoing real estate business and focus on industrial/warehouse properties after the sale in fiscal 2014 of the landscape nursery business that Griffin had operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. ( Imperial\u201d). Effective January 8, 2014, Griffin, Imperial and Monrovia Connecticut LLC ( Monrovia\u201d) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby Imperial's inventory and certain of its assets were sold to Monrovia for approximately $0.7 million in cash, before transaction and severance costs, and a non-interest bearing note receivable (which Griffin subsequently collected) of $4.25 million (the Imperial Sale\u201d).\nOn July 29, 2015, a subsidiary of Griffin closed on a new $18.0 million nonrecourse mortgage loan (the 40|86 Mortgage Loan\u201d) with 40|86 Mortgage Capital, Inc. The 40|86 Mortgage Loan is collateralized by three industrial buildings in NE Tradeport (75 International Drive, 754 and 758 Rainbow Road) aggregating approximately 392,000 square feet, has a fixed interest rate of 4.33% and a fifteen year term, with payments based on a thirty year amortization schedule. At closing, Griffin received cash proceeds from the 40|86 Mortgage Loan (before financing costs) of approximately $14.9 million, which were used in refinancing the maturing mortgage that had a principal balance of approximately $17.9 million and an interest rate of 5.73%. The remaining approximately $3.1 million of mortgage proceeds were deposited into escrow. As per the terms of the 40|86 Mortgage Loan, $2.5 million of the escrowed proceeds were released to Griffin in fiscal 2015 when the tenant that was leasing approximately 88,000 square feet on a month-to-month basis in 754 Rainbow entered into a long-term lease for that space and the remaining $0.6 million of escrowed proceeds were released to Griffin in fiscal 2016 when tenant improvements for the full building tenant in 758 Rainbow was completed.\nAlso in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Griffin entered into a new three year lease of its production nursery in Quincy, Florida (the Florida Farm\u201d). The Florida Farm had been leased to a nursery grower since fiscal 2009, but that lease ended in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. The new lease contains an option for the tenant to purchase the Florida Farm for a purchase price between $3.4 million and $3.9 million depending upon the date of sale.\nRevenue and gain recognition: Revenue includes rental revenue from Griffin's industrial and commercial properties and proceeds from property sales. Rental revenue is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term in accordance with the FASB ASC 840, Leases.\u201d Gains on property sales are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 360-20 Property, Plant and Equipment-Real Estate Sales\u201d based on the specific terms of each sale. When the percentage of completion method is used to account for a sale of real estate, costs included in determining the percentage of completion include the costs of the land sold, allocated master planning costs, selling and transaction costs and estimated future costs related to the land sold.\nCash payments in fiscal 2016 for new building construction reflect the construction, on speculation, of 5210 Jaindl, which was started in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and completed in fiscal 2016. Through November 30, 2016, Griffin has made total cash payments of approximately $12.0 million for the direct site work and building shell for 5210 Jaindl. Cash payments in fiscal 2016 for tenant and building improvements principally reflect tenant improvement work related to leases signed in the latter part of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. The cash spent on development costs and infrastructure improvements in fiscal 2016 principally reflects road improvements related to the Windsor Land Sale.\nGriffin's interest expense increased to approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2014. An increase in interest expense of approximately $0.5 million as a result of new mortgage loans in fiscal 2015 was partially offset by decreases in interest expense of approximately $0.2 million due to a higher amount of interest capitalized in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and approximately $0.1 million from refinancing a mortgage loan on three NE Tradeport buildings at a lower interest rate in fiscal 2015. The increase in the amount of interest capitalized in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 principally reflects an increase in construction activities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, including the construction of 5220 Jaindl, which was completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter.\nThe increase in total square footage as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, reflects the construction in fiscal 2016 of 5210 Jaindl Boulevard ( 5210 Jaindl\u201d), an approximately 252,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building which is the second of the two buildings built on an approximately 50 acre parcel of land known as Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. 5210 Jaindl was completed in the 2016 third quarter and Griffin entered into two leases for that building, resulting in 5210 Jaindl being fully leased as of November 30, 2016. Both of the new leases at 5210 Jaindl will become effective upon completion of tenant improvements, which are expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2017. As a result of leasing 5210 Jaindl, Griffin now has five fully leased industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley aggregating approximately 1,183,000 square feet.\n\nThe net cash used in investing activities of approximately $29.7 million in fiscal 2015 reflects cash payments of approximately $31.2 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $1.0 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses, partially offset by $1.5 million of cash received from the second and final payment under the note receivable from Monrovia and approximately $1.0 million of cash proceeds from property sales.\nThe decrease in cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects fiscal 2016 having an approximately $0.7 million decrease in cash from the change in deferred revenue as compared to an approximately $4.9 million increase in cash from the change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 having an approximately $0.1 million increase in cash from the change in other assets as compared to an approximately $1.1 million increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015. The change in deferred revenue of approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 principally reflects the recognition of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 principally reflects approximately $6.4 million of cash received from the tenant in 758 Rainbow for building and tenant improvements that is being recognized as additional rental revenue over the lease term, offset by the reduction of deferred revenue from the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The cash received by Griffin from the tenant in fiscal 2015 was related to building and tenant improvements in connection with a ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015 principally reflected approximately $0.9 million from a reduction in lease receivables.\nTotal revenue increased to approximately $30.9 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $28.1 million in fiscal 2015, reflecting an increase of approximately $1.9 million in rental revenue and approximately $0.9 million in revenue from property sales. Rental revenue increased to approximately $26.5 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $24.6 million in fiscal 2015 principally reflecting: (a) an increase of approximately $1.9 million from leasing previously vacant space; and (b) an increase of approximately $1.6 million from leasing space in 5220 Jaindl, which was completed and placed in service at the start of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter; partially offset by (c) a decrease of approximately $1.5 million from leases that expired; and (d) a decrease of approximately $0.2 million of rental revenue from lower expense reimbursements from tenants and other changes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $15.8 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $18.0 million in fiscal 2015 and approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects $45.5 million of proceeds from new mortgage debt (see below) and $0.6 million of mortgage proceeds released from escrow, partially offset by: (a) approximately $24.8 million of principal payments on mortgage loans; (b) approximately $3.4 million paid for the repurchase of common stock (see below); (c) a payment of approximately $1.5 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2016; and (d) approximately $0.6 million of payments for debt issuance costs. The principal payments on mortgage loans include approximately $21.1 million for the repayment of two mortgage loans that were refinanced (see below), approximately $2.7 million of recurring principal payments and a $1.0 million principal repayment from mortgage proceeds that had been held in escrow.\nInvestment income decreased to approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $0.3 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease of approximately $0.1 million principally reflects lower interest income from the amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $6.7 million in fiscal 2014. The increase of approximately $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects approximately $0.4 million related to 4270 Fritch, approximately $0.2 million related to 5220 Jaindl and an increase of approximately $0.3 million related to building improvements and tenant improvements in Griffin's other properties.\nThe higher interest expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects less interest capitalized in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015 and the higher amount of mortgage loans outstanding in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The higher income tax expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 reflects the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and an increase in income tax expense related to the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016 and a reduction in the valuation of certain state deferred tax assets.\nIncome taxes: In accounting for income taxes under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d management estimates future taxable income from operations, the sale of appreciated assets, the remaining years before the expiration of loss credit carryforwards, future reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that Griffin will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets.\nActivity by prospective tenants where Griffin's Connecticut properties are located (the north submarket of Hartford) was muted in fiscal 2014; however, there was an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants, mostly for\nIn the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 ( fiscal 2016\u201d), Griffin had net income of approximately $0.6 million as compared to net income of approximately $0.4 million in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 ( fiscal 2015\u201d). The slightly higher net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 principally reflects an increase of approximately $1.3 million in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.8 million in interest expense and an increase of approximately $0.3 million in income taxes in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\n\nOperating expenses of rental properties decreased to approximately $8.2 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $8.4 million in fiscal 2015. The slight decrease of approximately $0.2 million in operating expenses of rental properties in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects decreases of approximately $0.4 million in snow removal expenses, due to less severe winter weather in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015, and approximately $0.3 million in utility expenses, partially offset by operating expense increases of approximately $0.3 million at 5220 Jaindl, which was in service for the entire year in fiscal 2016 versus three months in fiscal 2015, approximately $0.1 million of operating expenses at 5210 Jaindl, which was placed in service in fiscal 2016, and approximately $0.1 million for real estate taxes.\nDerivative instruments: Griffin evaluates each interest rate swap agreement to determine if it qualifies as an effective cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of each interest rate swap agreement that management determines to be an effective cash flow hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined based on observable market participant data, such as yield curves, as of the fair value measurement date.\nGriffin's general and administrative expenses increased to approximately $7.4 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $7.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.3 million in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects an increase of approximately $0.2 million related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan and approximately $0.1 million for an increase in incentive compensation expense. The expense increase related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan reflects the effect of higher stock market performance on participant balances in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, that resulted in a greater increase in Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan liability in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in incentive compensation expense reflects Griffin's improved results in fiscal 2016 with regards to profit from leasing activities and gain on property sales as measured under Griffin's incentive compensation plan.\nThe approximately $1.3 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects an increase of approximately $2.0 million in profit from leasing activities (which Griffin defines as rental revenue less operating expenses of rental properties) and an increase of approximately $0.7 million in gain on property sales (revenue from property sales less costs related to property sales), partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expense and general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.1 million and approximately $0.3 million, respectively. The increase in profit from leasing activities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was driven by an increase in rental revenue from more space being leased in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015. The higher gain on property sales in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects the gain of approximately $3.2 million from the sale of undeveloped Griffin Center land that closed in fiscal 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects a full year of depreciation expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to a partial year in fiscal 2015, on 5220 Jaindl Boulevard ( 5220 Jaindl\u201d), an approximately 280,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania that was completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter and depreciation expense on tenant improvements related to new leases being higher in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects higher expenses related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan.\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2014 reflect the following:\nThe net increase of approximately 389,000 square feet in space leased as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 reflects leasing the entire approximately 280,000 square feet of 5220 Jaindl and several new leases in other buildings aggregating approximately 191,000 square feet of previously vacant space, partially offset by several leases aggregating approximately 52,000 square feet that expired and were not renewed and a lease of approximately 31,000 square feet that was terminated prior to its scheduled expiration date for which Griffin received a payment of approximately $0.2 million. The leasing of 5220 Jaindl reflected a five year lease for approximately 196,000 square feet that became effective at the start of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter. In November 2015, the tenant in 5220 Jaindl exercised its option to lease the balance of the building. Rental revenue on the additional space started in fiscal 2016. Most of the approximately 191,000 square feet of previously vacant space that was leased in fiscal 2015 was industrial/warehouse space in NE Tradeport. Griffin also extended several leases aggregating approximately 397,000 square feet that included approximately 326,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space in NE Tradeport and approximately 71,000 square feet of office/flex space in Griffin Center and Griffin Center South. Subsequent to November 30, 2015, Griffin leased approximately 102,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch. Had that lease been completed as of November 30, 2015, the percentage of square footage leased in Griffin's buildings as of that date would have been 92%.\n\nUnder the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin is required to construct roadways that will connect the land sold to existing town roadways. Accordingly, because of Griffin's continuing involvement with the land that was sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Through November 30, 2015, Griffin had recognized approximately $8.3 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale.\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2015 reflect the following:\nThe above information in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, Griffin's expectations regarding the leasing of currently vacant space, the acquisition of additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels, the commencement of speculative construction, the ability to obtain mortgage financing on Griffin's unleveraged properties, completion of the acquisition of land in Upper Macungie Township, completion of a new agreement to acquire land in East Allen Township, completion of the sale of approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury, completion of the sale of approximately 67 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing, completion of a mortgage loan on two NE Tradeport buildings aggregating approximately 275,000 square feet, Griffin's anticipated future liquidity, and other statements with the words believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d expects\u201d or similar expressions. Although Griffin believes that its plans, intentions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. The forward-looking statements made herein are based on assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by Griffin as of the date hereof, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of Griffin. Griffin's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n (2) Reflects the liability for Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The timing on the payment of participant balances in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan is not determinable. \n\nGriffin's payments (including principal and interest) under contractual obligations as of November 30, 2016 are as follows:\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2016 reflect the following:\nProceeds from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflect approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia and approximately $0.4 million from the deposit retained on the sale of the Florida Farm that did not close.\nIn fiscal 2014, Griffin reported an approximately $0.3 million gain from the sale of 500,000 shares of its common stock in Centaur Media for cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. Griffin did not sell any of its Centaur Media common stock in fiscal 2015. Griffin holds 1,952,462 shares of Centaur Media common stock and has not sold any Centaur Media common stock subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014. Management expects that it will continue to sell its Centaur Media common stock when it believes that sales terms are favorable. Also in fiscal 2014, Griffin incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $0.1 million related to the refinancing of two mortgage loans.\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $16.6 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $29.7 million in fiscal 2015 and approximately $3.9 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects cash payments of approximately $15.7 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $0.9 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses. The cash spent on deferred leasing costs and other in fiscal 2016 principally reflects lease commissions paid to real estate brokers for new leases. The approximately $3.5 million of proceeds, net of transaction expenses, received from the Griffin Center Land Sale were placed in escrow for potential acquisition of a replacement property in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nTotal revenue increased to approximately $28.1 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $24.2 million in fiscal 2014, reflecting an increase of approximately $4.1 million in rental revenue, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in revenue from property sales. Rental revenue increased to approximately $24.6 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $20.5 million in fiscal 2014 principally due to an increase in space leased in Griffin's buildings. The increase in rental revenue principally reflected: (a) an increase of approximately $2.9 million of rental revenue from leasing previously vacant space; (b) approximately $1.4 million of rental revenue from leasing space in two Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings that were placed in service in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015; (c) an increase of approximately $0.4 million of rental revenue in connection with agreements to terminate leases before their scheduled termination dates; and (d) an increase in rental revenue of approximately $0.3 million from all other leases; partially offset by (e) a decrease of approximately $0.9 million of rental revenue from leases that expired and were not renewed.\n\nGriffin's general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged at approximately $7.1 million in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. Increases of approximately $0.3 million of incentive compensation expense and approximately $0.2 million in expenses in real estate taxes and other expenses related to Griffin's undeveloped land, which are included in general and administrative expenses, were essentially offset by decreases of approximately $0.2 million in expenses related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, approximately $0.2 million in audit fee expenses and approximately $0.1 million in all other general and administrative expenses. The lower expense related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan reflects lower stock market performance in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, that resulted in a lower increase on participant balances in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nOn March 31, 2016, Griffin's Board of Directors authorized a program under which Griffin may repurchase up to $5.0 million in outstanding shares of its common stock over a twelve month period in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not obligate Griffin to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at management's discretion. In fiscal 2016, Griffin repurchased 105,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $3.4 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, Griffin repurchased an additional 19,173 shares of its common stock for approximately $0.6 million, resulting in approximately $1.0 million available for additional stock repurchases under the current repurchase program.\nIn the fiscal 2015 third quarter, Griffin received the Florida Farm Deposit from the tenant that leased the Florida Farm in connection with the tenant giving notice to Griffin at that time that it was exercising its option under the lease to purchase the Florida Farm. The tenant subsequently notified Griffin that it would not close on the purchase of the Florida Farm. Griffin retained the Florida Farm Deposit and entered into an agreement with the tenant to extend the lease of the Florida Farm through April 30, 2016.\nThe net cash of approximately $18.0 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected net proceeds of approximately $40.4 million from three mortgage loans (see below) and approximately $0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (a) approximately $20.1 million of payments of principal on Griffin's mortgage loans; (b) a payment of approximately $1.0 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2015; (c) approximately $0.8 million of payments for debt issuance costs related to the mortgage loans completed in fiscal 2015; and (d) approximately $0.6 million of mortgage proceeds placed in escrow. The principal payments on mortgage loans included approximately $17.9 million for the repayment of a mortgage loan that was refinanced (see below) and approximately $2.2 million of recurring principal payments.\nAs of November 30, 2016, Griffin had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24.7 million. Management believes that its cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2016, cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity under its $15.0 million revolving credit agreement with Webster will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, the continued investment in real estate assets, completion of the acquisition of undeveloped land in Upper Macungie Township, the repurchase of its common stock under the stock repurchase program currently in place, and the payment of dividends on its common stock, when and if declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next twelve months. Griffin may also continue to seek additional financing secured by nonrecourse mortgage loans on its properties. Griffin's real estate portfolio currently includes four Connecticut buildings aggregating approximately 314,000 square feet that are not mortgaged, however, Griffin has agreed to terms for a nonrecourse mortgage loan on two of those buildings that combined are approximately 275,000 square feet. Completion of this proposed new mortgage loan is subject to a number of contingencies, including the entry into a definitive loan agreement. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nOverview\nindustrial/warehouse space, in the latter part of fiscal 2014 that continued through fiscal 2015. Leasing activity in the Lehigh Valley in fiscal 2015 was somewhat slower than the previous year; however, the reported overall vacancy rate there continued to remain low in fiscal 2015.\nThe cash payments for development costs and infrastructure improvements primarily reflected ongoing road construction and other offsite improvements required under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately $13.0 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $5.4 million in fiscal 2014. The approximately $7.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, principally reflects: (a) an increase of approximately $4.6 million of cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014; and (b) an increase of approximately $3.0 million in cash generated from continuing operations, including adjustments to reconcile income (loss) from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations. The increase in cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, principally reflects approximately $4.9 million of cash from an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 as compared to approximately $3.0 million of cash in fiscal 2014 and approximately $1.1 million of cash from a change in other assets in fiscal 2015 as compared to an approximately $0.6 million decrease in cash in fiscal 2014. The change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 includes cash of approximately $6.4 million received from the tenant in 758 Rainbow for building and tenant improvements that is being recognized as additional rental revenue over the lease term, offset principally by the reduction of deferred revenue from the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015 principally reflects approximately $0.9 million from a reduction in lease receivables and approximately $0.4 million from a reduction in escrows related to Griffin's mortgage loans.\nGriffin's interest expense increased to approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.8 million in interest expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects approximately $0.5 million less interest capitalized in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015 and an increase in interest expense of approximately $0.4 million due to the increase in the amount of nonrecourse mortgage loans in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The lower amount of capitalized interest in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects the higher amount of construction activity in fiscal 2015 than fiscal 2016. The increase in nonrecourse mortgage loans in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects borrowings completed in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter that were outstanding for the entire year in fiscal 2016, a new borrowing in fiscal 2016 on 5210 Jaindl, and adding a previously unleveraged NE Tradeport building to a mortgage on several other NE Tradeport buildings in fiscal 2016.\nprincipal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.95%. At the time the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, combined with an existing interest rate swap agreement, effectively fixed the rate of the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage at 4.43% over the mortgage loan's ten year term. At the time the KeyBank Earn-Out was received, Griffin entered into another interest rate swap agreement for a notional principal amount of $1.85 million to fix the interest rate on the KeyBank Earn-Out at 3.88%. The combination of the three interest rate swap agreements effectively fixes the interest rate on the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage at 4.39% over the remainder of the mortgage loan's ten year term.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $7.2 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $13.0 million in fiscal 2015. The approximately $5.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects a decrease of approximately $6.8 million of cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.1 million in cash generated from the increase in net income as adjusted for noncash expenses and credits and gain on sale of properties in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, which principally reflects the increase in profit from leasing activities in fiscal 2016, driven by the increase in rental revenue.\nA summary of the total square footage and leased square footage of the buildings in Griffin's real estate portfolio is as follows:\nOn November 17, 2016, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage (the 2016 Webster Mortgage\u201d) for approximately $26.7 million. The 2016 Webster Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage with Webster Bank, N.A. ( Webster\u201d) which was due on September 1, 2025 and was collateralized by 5220 Jaindl (see below). The 2016 Webster Mortgage is collateralized by the approximately 280,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building, 5220 Jaindl, along with 5210 Jaindl, the adjacent approximately 252,000 square foot industrial building. Griffin received net proceeds of $13.0 million (before transaction costs), net of approximately $13.7 million used to refinance the existing mortgage with Webster. The 2016 Webster Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2016 Webster Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.70%. At the time the 2016 Webster Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Webster that, combined with two existing swap agreements with Webster, effectively fixes the rate of the 2016 Webster Mortgage at 3.79% over the mortgage loan's ten year term.\nOn January 20, 2017, Griffin agreed to terms on a nonrecourse mortgage loan of up to $12.0 million on two NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 275,000 square feet. Completion of this proposed new mortgage loan is subject to a number of contingencies, including the entry into a definitive loan agreement. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nIn the near-term, Griffin plans to continue to invest in its real estate business, including the construction of additional buildings on its undeveloped land, expenditures for tenant improvements as new leases are signed,\nrevenue from the Windsor Land Sale, reflecting approximately 99% of the total revenue to be recognized from such sale. The balance of the revenue from the Windsor Land Sale, approximately $0.1 million, will be recognized as the remaining costs, expected to be less than $0.1 million, of the required roadway construction are incurred, which is expected to be in fiscal 2017. While management has used its best estimates, based on industry knowledge and experience, in projecting the total costs of the required roadways being constructed, increases or decreases in future costs as compared with current estimated amounts would reduce or increase the gain recognized in future periods.\nOn January 25, 2016, Griffin entered into an Option Purchase Agreement (the Option Agreement\u201d) whereby Griffin granted the buyer an exclusive option, in exchange for a nominal fee, to purchase approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury for approximately $7.7 million. The buyer may extend the option period up to three years upon payment of additional option fees. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, the buyer paid Griffin to extend the option period. The land subject to the Option Agreement does not have any of the approvals that would be required for the buyer's planned use of the land. A closing on the land sale contemplated by the Option Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including the buyer securing contracts under a competitive bidding process that would require changes in the use of the land and obtaining local and state approvals for that planned use. There is no guarantee that the sale of undeveloped land as contemplated under the Option Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nGriffin's income tax provision increased to approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.3 million reflects approximately $0.2 million as a result of the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015 and approximately $0.1 million related to decreases in the valuation of certain state income tax benefits in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, Griffin's income tax provision included a charge of approximately $0.2 million for the reduction of the expected realization rate of tax benefits from Connecticut state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a change in Connecticut tax law, effective for Griffin beginning in fiscal 2016, that limits the future usage of loss carryforwards to 50% of taxable income. In fiscal 2015, Griffin's income tax provision included a charge of approximately $0.1 million for the reduction of the expected realization rate of tax benefits from certain state net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences as a result of changes in the expected utilization of such benefits. Griffin's effective income tax rate increased to 56.1% in fiscal 2016 from 47.2% in fiscal 2015. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects the effect in fiscal 2016 of a higher charge related to the reduction of certain state tax benefits.\nOn May 4, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase, as amended (the Macungie Purchase Agreement\u201d), to acquire, for a purchase price of $1.8 million, an approximately 14 acre site in Upper Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania for development of an approximately 134,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building. A closing on the land acquisition contemplated by the Macungie Purchase Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including Griffin obtaining all governmental approvals for its planned development of the land that would be acquired. There is no guarantee that the land acquisition as contemplated under the Macungie Purchase Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nOn December 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an agreement to sell approximately 67 acres of its undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing for approximately $10.25 million. Completion of this transaction is subject to a number of factors, including the buyer obtaining all necessary final permits from governmental authorities for development plans of the site it would acquire and the buyer receiving municipal and state economic development incentives it deems adequate. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nResults of Operations\nThe increase in total square footage as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 reflected 5220 Jaindl, the approximately 280,000 square foot industrial building completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter. 5220 Jaindl, located in the Lehigh Valley, was the first of two industrial buildings constructed on Lehigh Valley Tradeport II, the approximately 50 acre parcel of undeveloped land acquired mostly in fiscal 2013.\nA summary of the square footage of the buildings in Griffin's real estate portfolio is as follows:\nOn December 31, 2014, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage loan (the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage\u201d) on 4275 Fritch Drive ( 4275 Fritch\u201d) with First Niagara Bank, which was subsequently acquired by KeyBank. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage loan on 4275 Fritch and added 4270 Fritch to the collateral. Griffin received mortgage proceeds of approximately $10.9 million (before transaction costs) in addition to approximately $8.9 million used to refinance the existing mortgage on 4275 Fritch. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage is collateralized by 4270 Fritch, an approximately 303,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building, and 4275 Fritch, an adjacent approximately 228,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building. At the time of the mortgage closing, approximately 201,000 square feet of 4270 Fritch was leased. On December 11, 2015, Griffin received additional mortgage proceeds of $1.85 million (the KeyBank Earn-Out\u201d) when the remaining vacant space of approximately 102,000 square feet was leased. Griffin agreed that it would enter into a master lease with its subsidiaries that own 4270 Fritch and 4275 Fritch in order to maintain a minimum net rent equal to the debt service on the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage. The master lease would be co-terminus with the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly\nOperating expenses of rental properties increased to approximately $8.4 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $7.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating expenses of rental properties of approximately $0.6 million was due to a full year of operating expenses of 4270 Fritch in fiscal 2015 as compared to a partial year of such expenses in fiscal 2014, as that building was placed in service in the fiscal 2014 third quarter, and operating expenses of 5220 Jaindl, which was placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter. Operating expenses of all other rental properties were essentially unchanged in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOn July 22, 2016, Griffin entered into a two-year extension to its revolving credit line with Webster (the Webster Credit Line\u201d) that was scheduled to expire on August 1, 2016. The terms of the extension increased the amount of the credit line from $12.5 million to $15.0 million and Griffin has the option to further extend the credit line for an additional year provided there is no default at the time such extension is requested. The interest rate on the credit line extension remained at the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.75% and the collateral for the Webster Credit Line, Griffin's eight single-story office/flex buildings aggregating approximately 217,000 square feet in Griffin Center South, an approximately 48,000 square foot single-story office building in Griffin Center, and an approximately 18,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Griffin Center South also remained the same. There have been no borrowings under the Webster Credit Line since its inception, however, the Webster Credit Line does secure certain unused standby letters of credit aggregating approximately $1.8 million that are related to Griffin's development activities.\nSummary\nFiscal 2015 cash payments for new building construction, including site work, principally reflected the construction, on speculation, of 5220 Jaindl and the start of site work for 5210 Jaindl. The fiscal 2015 cash payments for tenant and building improvements related to leasing include approximately $7.8 million for improvements in connection with the ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow and approximately $2.9 million of improvements at 5220 Jaindl.", "item_7_text": "The net cash used in investing activities of approximately $3.9 million in fiscal 2014 reflects cash payments of approximately $15.6 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $1.2 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses, substantially offset by: (a) cash proceeds of approximately $8.9 million from the Windsor Land Sale that were returned from escrow; (b) cash proceeds of $2.75 million received from the first payment under the note receivable from Monrovia; (c) cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million from sales of Centaur Media common stock; (d) cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million, net of expenses, from property sales; and (e) cash proceeds of approximately $0.2 million from the Imperial Sale. At the closing of the Windsor Land Sale in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter, the proceeds of approximately $8.9 million were placed in escrow for a potential acquisition of a replacement property in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. As Griffin did not acquire a replacement property, the cash proceeds were returned to Griffin in fiscal 2014.\nThe net increase of approximately 360,000 square feet leased as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, reflects the approximately 252,000 square feet leased at 5210 Jaindl and several new leases aggregating approximately 240,000 square feet in other buildings, partially offset by several leases aggregating approximately 132,000 square feet that expired. Included in the approximately 240,000 square feet of new leasing in fiscal 2016 are a lease of approximately 101,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch Drive ( 4270 Fritch\u201d), one of Griffin's other industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley, a full building lease of 25 International Drive ( 25 International\u201d), an approximately 57,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in New England Tradeport ( NE Tradeport\u201d), Griffin's industrial park in Windsor and East Granby, Connecticut, a full building lease of an approximately 31,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Bloomfield, Connecticut, and a lease of approximately 16,000 square feet in a single story office building in Griffin Center. The new lease of 25 International replaced a lease that expired earlier in the year. The tenant of the expired lease had, in fiscal 2014, entered into a ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow Road ( 758 Rainbow\u201d), an approximately 138,000 square foot building in NE Tradeport, while remaining in 25 International during its period of transition to the larger facility.\nGriffin's effective income tax rate was 47.2% in fiscal 2015 as compared to 8.3% in fiscal 2014. The fiscal 2015 effective income tax rate reflects the federal statutory rate of 35% and state income taxes, including adjustments to the expected realization rate that certain state tax benefits will provide to Griffin in future years. To the extent that actual results differ from current projections, the projected realization rate would be different than the rate presently being used. In fiscal 2014 there was an income tax provision as compared to a pretax loss because the effect of reductions to certain state income tax benefits exceeded the federal income tax benefit, resulting in an overall income tax provision. The reductions to certain state income tax benefits were based on management's projections of the expected realization rate that those state tax benefits will provide to Griffin.\nOn September 1, 2015, Griffin closed on a $14.1 million nonrecourse mortgage loan (the Webster Mortgage Loan\u201d) with Webster. The Webster Mortgage Loan was collateralized by 5220 Jaindl. At closing, Griffin received cash proceeds from the Webster Mortgage Loan (before transaction costs) of $11.5 million. Subsequent to the closing of this loan, the tenant that was leasing approximately 196,000 square feet in 5220 Jaindl exercised its option to lease the balance of the building and Webster advanced the balance of the mortgage loan proceeds ($2.6 million) to Griffin on December 10, 2015. The Webster Mortgage Loan had a floating interest rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.65%, but Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Webster Bank at closing to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.77% over the loan term on the loan proceeds received at closing. At the time Griffin received the additional proceeds of $2.6 million, Griffin entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with Webster to effectively fix the interest rate on those loan proceeds at 3.67% for the balance of the term of the loan.\nRevenue from property sales decreased to approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2014. Revenue from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflects: (a) the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale; (b) approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia; and (c) $0.4 million from the Florida Farm Deposit (see below). Property sales occur periodically, and changes in revenue from year to year from those transactions may not be indicative of any trends in Griffin's real estate business.\nForward-Looking Information\nof the discount on the note receivable from Monrovia related to the Imperial Sale that closed in January 2014. The note receivable from Monrovia was fully paid on June 1, 2015.\nAll of Griffin's Connecticut industrial/warehouse and office/flex buildings are in the north submarket of Hartford. The real estate market for industrial/warehouse space in the Hartford, Connecticut area has improved over the last two years. A national real estate services company reported that the overall vacancy rate in the greater Hartford industrial market decreased from 12.3% at the end of 2014 to 9.2% at the end of 2016, with approximately 1.0 million square feet of net absorption in 2016. The Hartford office/flex market remained weak in 2016, with a national real estate services company reporting that the overall vacancy rate has remained at approximately 16% over the past two years, with vacancy in the north submarket of Hartford at approximately 21% over the past two years. Griffin's office/flex space was approximately 13% of Griffin's total square footage as of November 30, 2016. Griffin expects that its office/flex buildings will continue to become a smaller percentage of its total real estate portfolio as Griffin expects to focus on the growth of its industrial/warehouse building portfolio either through acquisition of fully or partially leased buildings, development of buildings on land currently owned or to be acquired or both. The real estate market for industrial/warehouse space in the Lehigh Valley has experienced strong growth and leasing activity during the past two years. The vacancy rate of Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse properties as reported by a national real estate services company was 5.2% at the end of the 2016, with a net absorption of approximately 7.6 million square feet in 2016. There is no guarantee that an active or strong real estate market or an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants will result in leasing space that was vacant as of November 30, 2016.\nOn April 26, 2016, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage (the 2016 PUB Mortgage\u201d) with People's United Bank, N.A. ( PUB\u201d) and received mortgage proceeds of $14.35 million, before transaction costs. The 2016 PUB Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage (the 2009 PUB Mortgage\u201d) with PUB that was due on August 1, 2019 and was collateralized by four of Griffin's NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings totaling approximately 240,000 square feet (14, 15, 16 and 40 International Drive). The 2009 PUB Mortgage had a balance of approximately $7.4 million at the time of the refinancing and a floating interest rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 3.08%. Griffin had entered into an interest rate swap agreement with PUB to effectively fix the rate on the 2009 PUB Mortgage at 6.58% for the term of that loan. The 2016 PUB Mortgage is collateralized by the same four properties as the 2009 PUB Mortgage along with another approximately 98,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building (35 International Drive) in NE Tradeport. At the closing of the 2016 PUB Mortgage, Griffin used a portion of the proceeds to repay the 2009 PUB Mortgage. The 2016 PUB Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2016 PUB Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.0%. At the time the 2016 PUB Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into a second interest rate swap agreement with PUB that, combined with the existing interest rate swap agreement with PUB, effectively fixes the interest rate of the 2016 PUB Mortgage at 4.17% over the loan term. The terms of the 2016 PUB Mortgage require that if either the tenant that leases approximately 58,000 square feet in 40 International Drive or the tenant that leases approximately 40,000 square feet in 14 International Drive does not extend its respective lease when it expires in fiscal 2021, a subsidiary of Griffin will enter into a master lease of the vacated space. The master lease would be guaranteed by Griffin and be in effect until either the space is re-leased to a new tenant or the due date of the 2016 PUB Mortgage Loan, whichever occurs first.\nThe net cash of approximately $1.4 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2014 reflected proceeds of approximately $5.5 million from a mortgage loan and approximately $0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (a) approximately $2.0 million for recurring payments of principal on Griffin's mortgage loans; (b) a payment of approximately $1.0 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2013 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2014; (c) $1.0 million of mortgage proceeds placed in escrow; and (d) approximately $0.1 million of payments for debt issuance costs.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to approximately $8.8 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $1.1 million in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects increases in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately $0.6 million related to 5220 Jaindl, which was in service for the entire year in fiscal 2016 versus three months in fiscal 2015, approximately $0.2 million related to 5210 Jaindl, which was placed in service in fiscal 2016, and approximately $0.5 million for tenant improvements related to new leases, offset by lower depreciation expense of approximately $0.2 million due to assets becoming fully depreciated.\nGriffin does not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nStock based compensation: Griffin determines stock based compensation based on the estimated fair values of stock options as determined on their grant dates using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. In determining the estimated fair values of stock options issued, Griffin makes assumptions on expected volatility, risk free interest rates, expected option terms and dividend yields.\ninfrastructure improvements required for future development of its real estate holdings and the potential acquisition of additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels in New England, the Mid-Atlantic states and other areas to expand the industrial/warehouse portion of its real estate portfolio. Real estate acquisitions may or may not occur based on many factors, including real estate pricing. Griffin may commence speculative construction projects on its undeveloped land that is either currently owned or acquired in the future if it believes market conditions are favorable for such development. Griffin may also construct a build-to-suit facility on its undeveloped land if lease terms are favorable.\nIncome from discontinued operations of approximately $0.1 million, net of tax, in fiscal 2014 reflected approximately $0.3 million, net of tax, for the effect of the termination of Griffin's postretirement benefits program and reclassification of actuarial gains previously reflected in other comprehensive income into net income, partially offset by approximately $0.2 million, net of tax, for the loss from the growing operations of the landscape nursery business through the date of the Imperial Sale. As substantially all of the former participants in Griffin's postretirement benefits program had been employed in the growing operations of the landscape nursery business that was reported as a discontinued operation, the reclassification of the actuarial gains is mostly included in the results of discontinued operations in fiscal 2014.\nImpairment of long-lived assets: Griffin reviews annually, as well as when conditions may indicate, its long-lived assets to determine if there are any indications of impairment, such as a prolonged vacancy in one of Griffin's rental properties. If indications of impairment are present, Griffin evaluates the carrying value of the assets in relation to undiscounted cash flows or the estimated fair value of the underlying assets. Development costs that have been capitalized are reviewed periodically for future recoverability.\nGriffin's revenue from property sales increased to approximately $4.4 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016, Griffin completed one property sale of approximately 29 acres of undeveloped land in Griffin Center (the Griffin Center Land Sale\u201d) for approximately $3.8 million in cash and a pretax gain of approximately $3.2 million. In fiscal 2016, in addition to the Griffin Center Land Sale, Griffin recognized revenue of approximately $0.6 million and a gain of approximately $0.4 million from the sale of approximately 90 acres of undeveloped land in Windsor, Connecticut (the Windsor Land Sale\u201d) that closed in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2013 ( fiscal 2013\u201d). Under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin is required to construct roadways to connect the land sold to existing town roadways. Accordingly, because of Griffin's continuing involvement with the land that was sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method. From the closing of the Windsor Land Sale in fiscal 2013 through November 30, 2016, Griffin has recognized approximately $8.8 million of\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nFiscal 2014 cash payments for new building construction principally reflected the completion of construction of 4270 Fritch. Cash payments for development costs and infrastructure improvements in fiscal 2014 included approximately $2.0 million for site work on a residential project and approximately $1.0 million for road construction required under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale.\nThe notes to Griffin's consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report contain a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of Griffin's consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, because of the relative magnitude of Griffin's real estate assets, accounting methods and estimates related to those assets are critical to the preparation of Griffin's consolidated financial statements. Griffin uses accounting policies and methods under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The following are the critical accounting estimates and methods used by Griffin:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFiscal 2016 Compared to Fiscal 2015\nOn March 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase (the East Allen Purchase Agreement\u201d) to acquire an approximately 31 acre site in East Allen Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania for development of an industrial/warehouse building. Subsequently, Griffin exercised its right to terminate the East Allen Purchase Agreement based on its due diligence findings. After the East Allen Purchase Agreement was terminated, Griffin has continued negotiations with the seller to reach a new agreement. Completion of a new purchase agreement is uncertain at this time.\nThe approximately $3.5 million of revenue from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflected: (a) approximately $2.5 million from the recognition of revenue related to the Windsor Land Sale; (b) approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia; and (c) $0.4 million from the retention of a deposit (the Florida Farm Deposit\u201d) related to the sale of the Florida Farm, which did not close. Griffin received the Florida Farm Deposit in fiscal 2015 from the tenant that leased the Florida Farm at that time in connection with the tenant giving notice to Griffin that it was exercising its option under the lease to purchase the Florida Farm. The tenant subsequently notified Griffin that it would not close on the purchase and Griffin retained the Florida Farm Deposit and entered into an agreement with the tenant to extend its lease through April 30, 2016. Property sales occur periodically, and changes in revenue from year to year from those transactions may not be indicative of any trends in Griffin's real estate business.\n (1) Includes obligations principally related to the development of Griffin's real estate assets. \nGriffin Industrial Realty, Inc. ( Griffin\u201d) is a real estate business principally engaged in developing, managing and leasing industrial/warehouse properties, and to a lesser extent, office/flex properties. Periodically, Griffin may sell certain portions of its undeveloped land that it has owned for an extended time period and the use of which is not consistent with Griffin's core development and leasing strategy. Griffin seeks to add to its property portfolio through the acquisition and development of land or the purchase of buildings. Prior to May 13, 2015, Griffin was known as Griffin Land & Nurseries, Inc. On May 13, 2015, Griffin changed its name to better reflect its ongoing real estate business and focus on industrial/warehouse properties after the sale in fiscal 2014 of the landscape nursery business that Griffin had operated through its wholly owned subsidiary, Imperial Nurseries, Inc. ( Imperial\u201d). Effective January 8, 2014, Griffin, Imperial and Monrovia Connecticut LLC ( Monrovia\u201d) entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby Imperial's inventory and certain of its assets were sold to Monrovia for approximately $0.7 million in cash, before transaction and severance costs, and a non-interest bearing note receivable (which Griffin subsequently collected) of $4.25 million (the Imperial Sale\u201d).\nOn July 29, 2015, a subsidiary of Griffin closed on a new $18.0 million nonrecourse mortgage loan (the 40|86 Mortgage Loan\u201d) with 40|86 Mortgage Capital, Inc. The 40|86 Mortgage Loan is collateralized by three industrial buildings in NE Tradeport (75 International Drive, 754 and 758 Rainbow Road) aggregating approximately 392,000 square feet, has a fixed interest rate of 4.33% and a fifteen year term, with payments based on a thirty year amortization schedule. At closing, Griffin received cash proceeds from the 40|86 Mortgage Loan (before financing costs) of approximately $14.9 million, which were used in refinancing the maturing mortgage that had a principal balance of approximately $17.9 million and an interest rate of 5.73%. The remaining approximately $3.1 million of mortgage proceeds were deposited into escrow. As per the terms of the 40|86 Mortgage Loan, $2.5 million of the escrowed proceeds were released to Griffin in fiscal 2015 when the tenant that was leasing approximately 88,000 square feet on a month-to-month basis in 754 Rainbow entered into a long-term lease for that space and the remaining $0.6 million of escrowed proceeds were released to Griffin in fiscal 2016 when tenant improvements for the full building tenant in 758 Rainbow was completed.\nAlso in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Griffin entered into a new three year lease of its production nursery in Quincy, Florida (the Florida Farm\u201d). The Florida Farm had been leased to a nursery grower since fiscal 2009, but that lease ended in the fiscal 2016 second quarter. The new lease contains an option for the tenant to purchase the Florida Farm for a purchase price between $3.4 million and $3.9 million depending upon the date of sale.\nRevenue and gain recognition: Revenue includes rental revenue from Griffin's industrial and commercial properties and proceeds from property sales. Rental revenue is accounted for on a straight-line basis over the applicable lease term in accordance with the FASB ASC 840, Leases.\u201d Gains on property sales are recognized in accordance with FASB ASC 360-20 Property, Plant and Equipment-Real Estate Sales\u201d based on the specific terms of each sale. When the percentage of completion method is used to account for a sale of real estate, costs included in determining the percentage of completion include the costs of the land sold, allocated master planning costs, selling and transaction costs and estimated future costs related to the land sold.\nCash payments in fiscal 2016 for new building construction reflect the construction, on speculation, of 5210 Jaindl, which was started in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and completed in fiscal 2016. Through November 30, 2016, Griffin has made total cash payments of approximately $12.0 million for the direct site work and building shell for 5210 Jaindl. Cash payments in fiscal 2016 for tenant and building improvements principally reflect tenant improvement work related to leases signed in the latter part of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016. The cash spent on development costs and infrastructure improvements in fiscal 2016 principally reflects road improvements related to the Windsor Land Sale.\nGriffin's interest expense increased to approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2014. An increase in interest expense of approximately $0.5 million as a result of new mortgage loans in fiscal 2015 was partially offset by decreases in interest expense of approximately $0.2 million due to a higher amount of interest capitalized in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 and approximately $0.1 million from refinancing a mortgage loan on three NE Tradeport buildings at a lower interest rate in fiscal 2015. The increase in the amount of interest capitalized in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 principally reflects an increase in construction activities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, including the construction of 5220 Jaindl, which was completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter.\nThe increase in total square footage as of November 30, 2016, as compared to November 30, 2015, reflects the construction in fiscal 2016 of 5210 Jaindl Boulevard ( 5210 Jaindl\u201d), an approximately 252,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building which is the second of the two buildings built on an approximately 50 acre parcel of land known as Lehigh Valley Tradeport II. 5210 Jaindl was completed in the 2016 third quarter and Griffin entered into two leases for that building, resulting in 5210 Jaindl being fully leased as of November 30, 2016. Both of the new leases at 5210 Jaindl will become effective upon completion of tenant improvements, which are expected to be completed in the first half of fiscal 2017. As a result of leasing 5210 Jaindl, Griffin now has five fully leased industrial/warehouse buildings in the Lehigh Valley aggregating approximately 1,183,000 square feet.\n\nThe net cash used in investing activities of approximately $29.7 million in fiscal 2015 reflects cash payments of approximately $31.2 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $1.0 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses, partially offset by $1.5 million of cash received from the second and final payment under the note receivable from Monrovia and approximately $1.0 million of cash proceeds from property sales.\nThe decrease in cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects fiscal 2016 having an approximately $0.7 million decrease in cash from the change in deferred revenue as compared to an approximately $4.9 million increase in cash from the change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016 having an approximately $0.1 million increase in cash from the change in other assets as compared to an approximately $1.1 million increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015. The change in deferred revenue of approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 principally reflects the recognition of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 principally reflects approximately $6.4 million of cash received from the tenant in 758 Rainbow for building and tenant improvements that is being recognized as additional rental revenue over the lease term, offset by the reduction of deferred revenue from the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The cash received by Griffin from the tenant in fiscal 2015 was related to building and tenant improvements in connection with a ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow that commenced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. The increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015 principally reflected approximately $0.9 million from a reduction in lease receivables.\nTotal revenue increased to approximately $30.9 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $28.1 million in fiscal 2015, reflecting an increase of approximately $1.9 million in rental revenue and approximately $0.9 million in revenue from property sales. Rental revenue increased to approximately $26.5 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $24.6 million in fiscal 2015 principally reflecting: (a) an increase of approximately $1.9 million from leasing previously vacant space; and (b) an increase of approximately $1.6 million from leasing space in 5220 Jaindl, which was completed and placed in service at the start of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter; partially offset by (c) a decrease of approximately $1.5 million from leases that expired; and (d) a decrease of approximately $0.2 million of rental revenue from lower expense reimbursements from tenants and other changes.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was approximately $15.8 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $18.0 million in fiscal 2015 and approximately $1.4 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects $45.5 million of proceeds from new mortgage debt (see below) and $0.6 million of mortgage proceeds released from escrow, partially offset by: (a) approximately $24.8 million of principal payments on mortgage loans; (b) approximately $3.4 million paid for the repurchase of common stock (see below); (c) a payment of approximately $1.5 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2016; and (d) approximately $0.6 million of payments for debt issuance costs. The principal payments on mortgage loans include approximately $21.1 million for the repayment of two mortgage loans that were refinanced (see below), approximately $2.7 million of recurring principal payments and a $1.0 million principal repayment from mortgage proceeds that had been held in escrow.\nInvestment income decreased to approximately $0.2 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $0.3 million in fiscal 2014. The decrease of approximately $0.1 million principally reflects lower interest income from the amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to approximately $7.7 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $6.7 million in fiscal 2014. The increase of approximately $1.0 million in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 reflects approximately $0.4 million related to 4270 Fritch, approximately $0.2 million related to 5220 Jaindl and an increase of approximately $0.3 million related to building improvements and tenant improvements in Griffin's other properties.\nThe higher interest expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects less interest capitalized in fiscal 2016 than in fiscal 2015 and the higher amount of mortgage loans outstanding in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The higher income tax expense in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 reflects the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, and an increase in income tax expense related to the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016 and a reduction in the valuation of certain state deferred tax assets.\nIncome taxes: In accounting for income taxes under Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 740, Income Taxes,\u201d management estimates future taxable income from operations, the sale of appreciated assets, the remaining years before the expiration of loss credit carryforwards, future reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies in determining if it is more likely than not that Griffin will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets.\nActivity by prospective tenants where Griffin's Connecticut properties are located (the north submarket of Hartford) was muted in fiscal 2014; however, there was an increase in inquiries from prospective tenants, mostly for\nIn the fiscal year ended November 30, 2016 ( fiscal 2016\u201d), Griffin had net income of approximately $0.6 million as compared to net income of approximately $0.4 million in the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015 ( fiscal 2015\u201d). The slightly higher net income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 principally reflects an increase of approximately $1.3 million in operating income in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 partially offset by an increase of approximately $0.8 million in interest expense and an increase of approximately $0.3 million in income taxes in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015.\n\nOperating expenses of rental properties decreased to approximately $8.2 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $8.4 million in fiscal 2015. The slight decrease of approximately $0.2 million in operating expenses of rental properties in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects decreases of approximately $0.4 million in snow removal expenses, due to less severe winter weather in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015, and approximately $0.3 million in utility expenses, partially offset by operating expense increases of approximately $0.3 million at 5220 Jaindl, which was in service for the entire year in fiscal 2016 versus three months in fiscal 2015, approximately $0.1 million of operating expenses at 5210 Jaindl, which was placed in service in fiscal 2016, and approximately $0.1 million for real estate taxes.\nDerivative instruments: Griffin evaluates each interest rate swap agreement to determine if it qualifies as an effective cash flow hedge. Changes in the fair value of each interest rate swap agreement that management determines to be an effective cash flow hedge are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income. The fair value of each interest rate swap agreement is determined based on observable market participant data, such as yield curves, as of the fair value measurement date.\nGriffin's general and administrative expenses increased to approximately $7.4 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $7.1 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.3 million in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects an increase of approximately $0.2 million related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan and approximately $0.1 million for an increase in incentive compensation expense. The expense increase related to the non-qualified deferred compensation plan reflects the effect of higher stock market performance on participant balances in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, that resulted in a greater increase in Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan liability in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in incentive compensation expense reflects Griffin's improved results in fiscal 2016 with regards to profit from leasing activities and gain on property sales as measured under Griffin's incentive compensation plan.\nThe approximately $1.3 million increase in operating income in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects an increase of approximately $2.0 million in profit from leasing activities (which Griffin defines as rental revenue less operating expenses of rental properties) and an increase of approximately $0.7 million in gain on property sales (revenue from property sales less costs related to property sales), partially offset by increases in depreciation and amortization expense and general and administrative expenses of approximately $1.1 million and approximately $0.3 million, respectively. The increase in profit from leasing activities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, was driven by an increase in rental revenue from more space being leased in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015. The higher gain on property sales in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects the gain of approximately $3.2 million from the sale of undeveloped Griffin Center land that closed in fiscal 2016. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects a full year of depreciation expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to a partial year in fiscal 2015, on 5220 Jaindl Boulevard ( 5220 Jaindl\u201d), an approximately 280,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania that was completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter and depreciation expense on tenant improvements related to new leases being higher in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015. The increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects higher expenses related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan.\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2014 reflect the following:\nThe net increase of approximately 389,000 square feet in space leased as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 reflects leasing the entire approximately 280,000 square feet of 5220 Jaindl and several new leases in other buildings aggregating approximately 191,000 square feet of previously vacant space, partially offset by several leases aggregating approximately 52,000 square feet that expired and were not renewed and a lease of approximately 31,000 square feet that was terminated prior to its scheduled expiration date for which Griffin received a payment of approximately $0.2 million. The leasing of 5220 Jaindl reflected a five year lease for approximately 196,000 square feet that became effective at the start of the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter. In November 2015, the tenant in 5220 Jaindl exercised its option to lease the balance of the building. Rental revenue on the additional space started in fiscal 2016. Most of the approximately 191,000 square feet of previously vacant space that was leased in fiscal 2015 was industrial/warehouse space in NE Tradeport. Griffin also extended several leases aggregating approximately 397,000 square feet that included approximately 326,000 square feet of industrial/warehouse space in NE Tradeport and approximately 71,000 square feet of office/flex space in Griffin Center and Griffin Center South. Subsequent to November 30, 2015, Griffin leased approximately 102,000 square feet in 4270 Fritch. Had that lease been completed as of November 30, 2015, the percentage of square footage leased in Griffin's buildings as of that date would have been 92%.\n\nUnder the terms of the Windsor Land Sale, Griffin is required to construct roadways that will connect the land sold to existing town roadways. Accordingly, because of Griffin's continuing involvement with the land that was sold, the Windsor Land Sale is being accounted for under the percentage of completion method. Through November 30, 2015, Griffin had recognized approximately $8.3 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale.\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2015 reflect the following:\nThe above information in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, Griffin's expectations regarding the leasing of currently vacant space, the acquisition of additional properties and/or undeveloped land parcels, the commencement of speculative construction, the ability to obtain mortgage financing on Griffin's unleveraged properties, completion of the acquisition of land in Upper Macungie Township, completion of a new agreement to acquire land in East Allen Township, completion of the sale of approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury, completion of the sale of approximately 67 acres of undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing, completion of a mortgage loan on two NE Tradeport buildings aggregating approximately 275,000 square feet, Griffin's anticipated future liquidity, and other statements with the words believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d expects\u201d or similar expressions. Although Griffin believes that its plans, intentions and expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, it can give no assurance that such plans, intentions or expectations will be achieved. The forward-looking statements made herein are based on assumptions and estimates that, while considered reasonable by Griffin as of the date hereof, are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive and regulatory uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond the control of Griffin. Griffin's actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those set forth under the heading Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report.\n (2) Reflects the liability for Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan. The timing on the payment of participant balances in the non-qualified deferred compensation plan is not determinable. \n\nGriffin's payments (including principal and interest) under contractual obligations as of November 30, 2016 are as follows:\nCash payments for additions to real estate assets in fiscal 2016 reflect the following:\nProceeds from property sales in fiscal 2015 reflect approximately $0.6 million from the sale of land that had been part of the Connecticut farm used by Imperial but not part of the long-term lease to Monrovia and approximately $0.4 million from the deposit retained on the sale of the Florida Farm that did not close.\nIn fiscal 2014, Griffin reported an approximately $0.3 million gain from the sale of 500,000 shares of its common stock in Centaur Media for cash proceeds of approximately $0.6 million. Griffin did not sell any of its Centaur Media common stock in fiscal 2015. Griffin holds 1,952,462 shares of Centaur Media common stock and has not sold any Centaur Media common stock subsequent to the end of fiscal 2014. Management expects that it will continue to sell its Centaur Media common stock when it believes that sales terms are favorable. Also in fiscal 2014, Griffin incurred a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $0.1 million related to the refinancing of two mortgage loans.\nFiscal 2015 Compared to Fiscal 2014\nNet cash used in investing activities was approximately $16.6 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $29.7 million in fiscal 2015 and approximately $3.9 million in fiscal 2014. The net cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2016 reflects cash payments of approximately $15.7 million for additions to real estate assets and approximately $0.9 million for deferred leasing costs and other uses. The cash spent on deferred leasing costs and other in fiscal 2016 principally reflects lease commissions paid to real estate brokers for new leases. The approximately $3.5 million of proceeds, net of transaction expenses, received from the Griffin Center Land Sale were placed in escrow for potential acquisition of a replacement property in a like-kind exchange under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.\nTotal revenue increased to approximately $28.1 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $24.2 million in fiscal 2014, reflecting an increase of approximately $4.1 million in rental revenue, partially offset by a decrease of approximately $0.2 million in revenue from property sales. Rental revenue increased to approximately $24.6 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $20.5 million in fiscal 2014 principally due to an increase in space leased in Griffin's buildings. The increase in rental revenue principally reflected: (a) an increase of approximately $2.9 million of rental revenue from leasing previously vacant space; (b) approximately $1.4 million of rental revenue from leasing space in two Lehigh Valley industrial/warehouse buildings that were placed in service in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015; (c) an increase of approximately $0.4 million of rental revenue in connection with agreements to terminate leases before their scheduled termination dates; and (d) an increase in rental revenue of approximately $0.3 million from all other leases; partially offset by (e) a decrease of approximately $0.9 million of rental revenue from leases that expired and were not renewed.\n\nGriffin's general and administrative expenses were essentially unchanged at approximately $7.1 million in both fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. Increases of approximately $0.3 million of incentive compensation expense and approximately $0.2 million in expenses in real estate taxes and other expenses related to Griffin's undeveloped land, which are included in general and administrative expenses, were essentially offset by decreases of approximately $0.2 million in expenses related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan, approximately $0.2 million in audit fee expenses and approximately $0.1 million in all other general and administrative expenses. The lower expense related to Griffin's non-qualified deferred compensation plan reflects lower stock market performance in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, that resulted in a lower increase on participant balances in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nOn March 31, 2016, Griffin's Board of Directors authorized a program under which Griffin may repurchase up to $5.0 million in outstanding shares of its common stock over a twelve month period in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase program does not obligate Griffin to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at management's discretion. In fiscal 2016, Griffin repurchased 105,000 shares of its common stock for approximately $3.4 million. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, Griffin repurchased an additional 19,173 shares of its common stock for approximately $0.6 million, resulting in approximately $1.0 million available for additional stock repurchases under the current repurchase program.\nIn the fiscal 2015 third quarter, Griffin received the Florida Farm Deposit from the tenant that leased the Florida Farm in connection with the tenant giving notice to Griffin at that time that it was exercising its option under the lease to purchase the Florida Farm. The tenant subsequently notified Griffin that it would not close on the purchase of the Florida Farm. Griffin retained the Florida Farm Deposit and entered into an agreement with the tenant to extend the lease of the Florida Farm through April 30, 2016.\nThe net cash of approximately $18.0 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2015 reflected net proceeds of approximately $40.4 million from three mortgage loans (see below) and approximately $0.1 million received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by: (a) approximately $20.1 million of payments of principal on Griffin's mortgage loans; (b) a payment of approximately $1.0 million for a dividend on Griffin's common stock that was declared in the fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and paid in fiscal 2015; (c) approximately $0.8 million of payments for debt issuance costs related to the mortgage loans completed in fiscal 2015; and (d) approximately $0.6 million of mortgage proceeds placed in escrow. The principal payments on mortgage loans included approximately $17.9 million for the repayment of a mortgage loan that was refinanced (see below) and approximately $2.2 million of recurring principal payments.\nAs of November 30, 2016, Griffin had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $24.7 million. Management believes that its cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2016, cash generated from operations, and borrowing capacity under its $15.0 million revolving credit agreement with Webster will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements, the continued investment in real estate assets, completion of the acquisition of undeveloped land in Upper Macungie Township, the repurchase of its common stock under the stock repurchase program currently in place, and the payment of dividends on its common stock, when and if declared by the Board of Directors, for at least the next twelve months. Griffin may also continue to seek additional financing secured by nonrecourse mortgage loans on its properties. Griffin's real estate portfolio currently includes four Connecticut buildings aggregating approximately 314,000 square feet that are not mortgaged, however, Griffin has agreed to terms for a nonrecourse mortgage loan on two of those buildings that combined are approximately 275,000 square feet. Completion of this proposed new mortgage loan is subject to a number of contingencies, including the entry into a definitive loan agreement. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nOverview\nindustrial/warehouse space, in the latter part of fiscal 2014 that continued through fiscal 2015. Leasing activity in the Lehigh Valley in fiscal 2015 was somewhat slower than the previous year; however, the reported overall vacancy rate there continued to remain low in fiscal 2015.\nThe cash payments for development costs and infrastructure improvements primarily reflected ongoing road construction and other offsite improvements required under the terms of the Windsor Land Sale.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately $13.0 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $5.4 million in fiscal 2014. The approximately $7.6 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, principally reflects: (a) an increase of approximately $4.6 million of cash generated from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014; and (b) an increase of approximately $3.0 million in cash generated from continuing operations, including adjustments to reconcile income (loss) from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations. The increase in cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2015, as compared to fiscal 2014, principally reflects approximately $4.9 million of cash from an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 as compared to approximately $3.0 million of cash in fiscal 2014 and approximately $1.1 million of cash from a change in other assets in fiscal 2015 as compared to an approximately $0.6 million decrease in cash in fiscal 2014. The change in deferred revenue in fiscal 2015 includes cash of approximately $6.4 million received from the tenant in 758 Rainbow for building and tenant improvements that is being recognized as additional rental revenue over the lease term, offset principally by the reduction of deferred revenue from the recognition of approximately $2.5 million of revenue from the Windsor Land Sale. The increase in cash from the change in other assets in fiscal 2015 principally reflects approximately $0.9 million from a reduction in lease receivables and approximately $0.4 million from a reduction in escrows related to Griffin's mortgage loans.\nGriffin's interest expense increased to approximately $4.5 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $3.7 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.8 million in interest expense in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects approximately $0.5 million less interest capitalized in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015 and an increase in interest expense of approximately $0.4 million due to the increase in the amount of nonrecourse mortgage loans in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015. The lower amount of capitalized interest in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects the higher amount of construction activity in fiscal 2015 than fiscal 2016. The increase in nonrecourse mortgage loans in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, reflects borrowings completed in the fiscal 2015 fourth quarter that were outstanding for the entire year in fiscal 2016, a new borrowing in fiscal 2016 on 5210 Jaindl, and adding a previously unleveraged NE Tradeport building to a mortgage on several other NE Tradeport buildings in fiscal 2016.\nprincipal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.95%. At the time the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement that, combined with an existing interest rate swap agreement, effectively fixed the rate of the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage at 4.43% over the mortgage loan's ten year term. At the time the KeyBank Earn-Out was received, Griffin entered into another interest rate swap agreement for a notional principal amount of $1.85 million to fix the interest rate on the KeyBank Earn-Out at 3.88%. The combination of the three interest rate swap agreements effectively fixes the interest rate on the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage at 4.39% over the remainder of the mortgage loan's ten year term.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was approximately $7.2 million in fiscal 2016 as compared to approximately $13.0 million in fiscal 2015. The approximately $5.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects a decrease of approximately $6.8 million of cash from changes in assets and liabilities in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, partially offset by an increase of approximately $1.1 million in cash generated from the increase in net income as adjusted for noncash expenses and credits and gain on sale of properties in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015, which principally reflects the increase in profit from leasing activities in fiscal 2016, driven by the increase in rental revenue.\nA summary of the total square footage and leased square footage of the buildings in Griffin's real estate portfolio is as follows:\nOn November 17, 2016, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage (the 2016 Webster Mortgage\u201d) for approximately $26.7 million. The 2016 Webster Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage with Webster Bank, N.A. ( Webster\u201d) which was due on September 1, 2025 and was collateralized by 5220 Jaindl (see below). The 2016 Webster Mortgage is collateralized by the approximately 280,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building, 5220 Jaindl, along with 5210 Jaindl, the adjacent approximately 252,000 square foot industrial building. Griffin received net proceeds of $13.0 million (before transaction costs), net of approximately $13.7 million used to refinance the existing mortgage with Webster. The 2016 Webster Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly principal payments based on a twenty-five year amortization schedule. The interest rate for the 2016 Webster Mortgage is a floating rate of the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.70%. At the time the 2016 Webster Mortgage closed, Griffin entered into an interest rate swap agreement with Webster that, combined with two existing swap agreements with Webster, effectively fixes the rate of the 2016 Webster Mortgage at 3.79% over the mortgage loan's ten year term.\nOn January 20, 2017, Griffin agreed to terms on a nonrecourse mortgage loan of up to $12.0 million on two NE Tradeport industrial/warehouse buildings aggregating approximately 275,000 square feet. Completion of this proposed new mortgage loan is subject to a number of contingencies, including the entry into a definitive loan agreement. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nIn the near-term, Griffin plans to continue to invest in its real estate business, including the construction of additional buildings on its undeveloped land, expenditures for tenant improvements as new leases are signed,\nrevenue from the Windsor Land Sale, reflecting approximately 99% of the total revenue to be recognized from such sale. The balance of the revenue from the Windsor Land Sale, approximately $0.1 million, will be recognized as the remaining costs, expected to be less than $0.1 million, of the required roadway construction are incurred, which is expected to be in fiscal 2017. While management has used its best estimates, based on industry knowledge and experience, in projecting the total costs of the required roadways being constructed, increases or decreases in future costs as compared with current estimated amounts would reduce or increase the gain recognized in future periods.\nOn January 25, 2016, Griffin entered into an Option Purchase Agreement (the Option Agreement\u201d) whereby Griffin granted the buyer an exclusive option, in exchange for a nominal fee, to purchase approximately 280 acres of undeveloped land in Simsbury for approximately $7.7 million. The buyer may extend the option period up to three years upon payment of additional option fees. Subsequent to November 30, 2016, the buyer paid Griffin to extend the option period. The land subject to the Option Agreement does not have any of the approvals that would be required for the buyer's planned use of the land. A closing on the land sale contemplated by the Option Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including the buyer securing contracts under a competitive bidding process that would require changes in the use of the land and obtaining local and state approvals for that planned use. There is no guarantee that the sale of undeveloped land as contemplated under the Option Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nGriffin's income tax provision increased to approximately $0.7 million in fiscal 2016 from approximately $0.4 million in fiscal 2015. The increase of approximately $0.3 million reflects approximately $0.2 million as a result of the higher pretax income in fiscal 2016 than fiscal 2015 and approximately $0.1 million related to decreases in the valuation of certain state income tax benefits in fiscal 2016. In fiscal 2016, Griffin's income tax provision included a charge of approximately $0.2 million for the reduction of the expected realization rate of tax benefits from Connecticut state net operating loss carryforwards as a result of a change in Connecticut tax law, effective for Griffin beginning in fiscal 2016, that limits the future usage of loss carryforwards to 50% of taxable income. In fiscal 2015, Griffin's income tax provision included a charge of approximately $0.1 million for the reduction of the expected realization rate of tax benefits from certain state net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences as a result of changes in the expected utilization of such benefits. Griffin's effective income tax rate increased to 56.1% in fiscal 2016 from 47.2% in fiscal 2015. The higher effective tax rate in fiscal 2016, as compared to fiscal 2015, principally reflects the effect in fiscal 2016 of a higher charge related to the reduction of certain state tax benefits.\nOn May 4, 2016, Griffin entered into an Agreement of Sale and Purchase, as amended (the Macungie Purchase Agreement\u201d), to acquire, for a purchase price of $1.8 million, an approximately 14 acre site in Upper Macungie Township, Lehigh County, Pennsylvania for development of an approximately 134,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building. A closing on the land acquisition contemplated by the Macungie Purchase Agreement is subject to several significant contingencies, including Griffin obtaining all governmental approvals for its planned development of the land that would be acquired. There is no guarantee that the land acquisition as contemplated under the Macungie Purchase Agreement will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nOn December 23, 2016, Griffin entered into an agreement to sell approximately 67 acres of its undeveloped land in Phoenix Crossing for approximately $10.25 million. Completion of this transaction is subject to a number of factors, including the buyer obtaining all necessary final permits from governmental authorities for development plans of the site it would acquire and the buyer receiving municipal and state economic development incentives it deems adequate. There is no guarantee that this transaction will be completed under its current terms, or at all.\nResults of Operations\nThe increase in total square footage as of November 30, 2015 as compared to November 30, 2014 reflected 5220 Jaindl, the approximately 280,000 square foot industrial building completed and placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter. 5220 Jaindl, located in the Lehigh Valley, was the first of two industrial buildings constructed on Lehigh Valley Tradeport II, the approximately 50 acre parcel of undeveloped land acquired mostly in fiscal 2013.\nA summary of the square footage of the buildings in Griffin's real estate portfolio is as follows:\nOn December 31, 2014, Griffin closed on a nonrecourse mortgage loan (the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage\u201d) on 4275 Fritch Drive ( 4275 Fritch\u201d) with First Niagara Bank, which was subsequently acquired by KeyBank. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage refinanced an existing mortgage loan on 4275 Fritch and added 4270 Fritch to the collateral. Griffin received mortgage proceeds of approximately $10.9 million (before transaction costs) in addition to approximately $8.9 million used to refinance the existing mortgage on 4275 Fritch. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage is collateralized by 4270 Fritch, an approximately 303,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building, and 4275 Fritch, an adjacent approximately 228,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building. At the time of the mortgage closing, approximately 201,000 square feet of 4270 Fritch was leased. On December 11, 2015, Griffin received additional mortgage proceeds of $1.85 million (the KeyBank Earn-Out\u201d) when the remaining vacant space of approximately 102,000 square feet was leased. Griffin agreed that it would enter into a master lease with its subsidiaries that own 4270 Fritch and 4275 Fritch in order to maintain a minimum net rent equal to the debt service on the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage. The master lease would be co-terminus with the 2025 KeyBank Mortgage. The 2025 KeyBank Mortgage has a ten year term with monthly\nOperating expenses of rental properties increased to approximately $8.4 million in fiscal 2015 from approximately $7.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase in operating expenses of rental properties of approximately $0.6 million was due to a full year of operating expenses of 4270 Fritch in fiscal 2015 as compared to a partial year of such expenses in fiscal 2014, as that building was placed in service in the fiscal 2014 third quarter, and operating expenses of 5220 Jaindl, which was placed in service at the end of the fiscal 2015 third quarter. Operating expenses of all other rental properties were essentially unchanged in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOn July 22, 2016, Griffin entered into a two-year extension to its revolving credit line with Webster (the Webster Credit Line\u201d) that was scheduled to expire on August 1, 2016. The terms of the extension increased the amount of the credit line from $12.5 million to $15.0 million and Griffin has the option to further extend the credit line for an additional year provided there is no default at the time such extension is requested. The interest rate on the credit line extension remained at the one month LIBOR rate plus 2.75% and the collateral for the Webster Credit Line, Griffin's eight single-story office/flex buildings aggregating approximately 217,000 square feet in Griffin Center South, an approximately 48,000 square foot single-story office building in Griffin Center, and an approximately 18,000 square foot industrial/warehouse building in Griffin Center South also remained the same. There have been no borrowings under the Webster Credit Line since its inception, however, the Webster Credit Line does secure certain unused standby letters of credit aggregating approximately $1.8 million that are related to Griffin's development activities.\nSummary\nFiscal 2015 cash payments for new building construction, including site work, principally reflected the construction, on speculation, of 5220 Jaindl and the start of site work for 5210 Jaindl. The fiscal 2015 cash payments for tenant and building improvements related to leasing include approximately $7.8 million for improvements in connection with the ten year full building lease of 758 Rainbow and approximately $2.9 million of improvements at 5220 Jaindl.", "item_7_tables": "Table 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

It also develops and sells land periodically. \n\n- Revenue was $30.9 million in fiscal 2016, up from $28.1 million in fiscal 2015, due to higher rental revenue from leasing vacant space and property sales. Net income was $0.6 million in fiscal 2016 versus $0.4 million in fiscal 2015.\n\n- As of November 30, 2016, Griffin's real estate portfolio was 93% leased, up from 89% leased as of November 30, 2015. Total square footage increased due to completion of a new 252,000 square foot industrial building. \n\n- Griffin invested $15.7 million in real estate assets in fiscal 2016, down from $31.2 million in fiscal 2015, reflecting completion of major construction projects. Main projects were two industrial buildings in Pennsylvania.\n\n- Cash from operations was $7.2 million in fiscal 2016, down from $13 million in fiscal 2015, mostly due to timing differences in working capital. \n\n- Griffin has $24.7 million of cash on hand as of November 30, 2016 and an undrawn $15 million revolving credit line. It expects this liquidity to be sufficient for the next 12 months.\n\n- Near term plans include investing in existing properties, starting construction on land holdings, and acquiring additional properties. Completion of acquisitions in progress is uncertain."}
