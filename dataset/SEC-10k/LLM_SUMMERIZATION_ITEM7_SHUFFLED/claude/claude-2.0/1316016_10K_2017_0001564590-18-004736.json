Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this report. See also the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a leader in the design, development and marketing of advanced high-speed communications integrated circuits, or ICs, for Ethernet connectivity in the data center, enterprise infrastructure and access markets. Our Ethernet solutions provide a critical interface between the high-speed analog signals transported over wired infrastructure and the digital information used in computing and networking equipment. Our products are designed to cost-effectively deliver leading-edge data speeds for use in the latest generation of communications infrastructure to alleviate network bandwidth bottlenecks caused by the exponential growth of global Internet Protocol, or IP, traffic. Many of our semiconductor solutions have established benchmarks in the industry in terms of performance, power consumption and density. Our innovative solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings, position themselves to gain market share and drive the ongoing equipment infrastructure upgrade cycles in the data center, enterprise infrastructure and access markets.\nWe are a fabless semiconductor company. We have shipped more than 10 million ports to customers across three semiconductor process generations, and are currently in mass production in 28nm process node. 28nm and other silicon process geometries, such as 40nm and 90nm, refer to the size of the process node in nanometers for a particular semiconductor manufacturing process. Our end customers include Aruba (acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in 2015), Brocade, Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Intel, Juniper, Oracle and Ruckus (acquired by Brocade in 2016). For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue was $103.4 million, $86.7 million and $80.8 million, respectively, our net loss was $5.4 million, $0.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and our non-GAAP net income (loss) was $(2.7) million, $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. See Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\nWe derive revenue from our products, which include our 10GBASE-T physical layer devices, or PHYs, custom ASICs for Intel and our recently developed AQrate product line. We currently generate revenue from the sale of our products directly to IC suppliers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and original design manufacturers, or ODMs. We market and sell our products through our direct sales force.\nWe shipped our first products in 2009. Historically, a substantial majority of our revenue has been generated from our largest customer, Intel, including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of this customer in the data center server market, in particular the server portion of that market in support of our relationship with Intel. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Intel accounted for 60%, 68% and 78% and Cisco accounted for 28%, 21% and 13% of our revenue, respectively. Our 10 largest customers collectively accounted for 97%, 98% and 98% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we acquire new customers and sell additional products to our existing customers. While we intend to expand our customer base over time, the markets we serve tend to be highly concentrated, and we expect that a large portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future. As the markets expand, the market share of our largest customers may not increase proportionally or may decrease as competition enters into the market. This has in the past materially impacted our revenues and our market share, and it may continue to do so in the future until the diversification of our customer base lessens the impact of this significant customer concentration.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nPricing and Product Cost. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the ICs we provide to our customers. We believe the primary driver of gross margin is the average selling prices, or ASPs, negotiated between us and our customers relative to volume, material costs and manufacturing yield. Typically, our selling prices are contractually set for multiple quarters and our prototype selling prices are higher than our selling prices at volume production. In certain cases, we have agreed in advance to modest price reductions, generally over a period of time ranging from 18 months to five years, once the specified product begins to ship in volume. However, our customers may change their purchase orders and demand forecasts at any time with limited notice, which can sometimes lead to price renegotiations. Although these price renegotiations can sometimes result in ASPs of our products fluctuating over the shorter term, we expect ASPs generally to decline over the longer term as our products mature. These declines often coincide with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly and testing costs, which offset some or all of the margin reduction that results from lower ASPs. Since we rely on third-party wafer foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our ICs, we maintain a close relationship with our suppliers to improve quality, increase yields and lower manufacturing costs. In addition, our customers may seek to renegotiate product pricing under the contracts or purchase orders we have with them based on volume or other factors, which could drive fluctuations in ASPs.\nDesign Wins with New and Existing Customers. Our existing and prospective customers tend to be multinational enterprises with large annual purchases of ICs that are continuously developing new products for existing and new application areas. Our solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings and position themselves to gain market share and drive the next upgrade cycles in data center and enterprise infrastructure. We have programs in place to help our existing customers use our solutions throughout their product portfolio, and we work closely with our existing and prospective customers to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. Because of our extended sales cycle, our revenue in future years is highly dependent on design wins we are awarded today. Further, because we expect our revenue relating to our mature products to decline in the future, we consider design wins critical to our future success and anticipate being increasingly dependent on revenue from newer design wins for our newer products.\nCustomer Demand and Product Life Cycles. Once customers design our ICs into their products, we closely monitor all phases of the product life cycle, including the initial design phase, prototype production, volume production and inventories. For example, during the periods presented, we had several products progressing through their product life cycles. In the data center market, the majority of our revenue for the periods presented was derived from our 10GBASE-T custom ASIC product, which we refer to as Twinville. In late 2015, we introduced and began to record revenue from our Sageville and Coppervale products. We anticipate that our Twinville product will transition to these two newer ASIC products over time, although the timing and rate of such transition will depend on our customers' adoption of these products and the demand for our customers' products. In the enterprise infrastructure market, during the periods presented, we developed our 5GBASE-T and 2.5GBASE-T AQrate product. We first shipped our AQrate products into the enterprise infrastructure market in the fourth quarter of 2014. We began shipping AQrate products in volume in 2015 and 2016. We also started to ship our multiple lines of products into the access market in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect the revenue from our AQrate products, and therefore the percentage of our total revenue attributable to the enterprise infrastructure and access markets, to increase from the current levels.\nWe also carefully monitor changes in customer demand and end-market demand, including seasonality, cyclicality and the competitive landscape. Our customers share their development schedules with us, including the projected launch dates of their product offerings. Once our customers are in production, they generally will provide nine to 12-month forecasts of expected demand, which gives us an indication of future demand. However, our customers may change their purchase orders and demand forecasts at any time with limited notice. In light of our significant customer concentration, our revenue is likely to be materially and disproportionally, due in part to fluctuating end-market demand, impacted by the purchasing decisions of our largest customers.\nSeasonality\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation as we begin to serve many markets and end-markets which historically experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year which may result in slower growth and lower sales as compared to other quarters.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our products. We sell our products direct to our customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors, and do not currently have a material amount of revenue sold to distributors during the sales process. We offer a limited number of customer rebates and accrue an estimate of such rebates at the time revenue is recognized. Such rebates were not material in any of the periods presented, and the differences between the actual amount of such rebates and our estimates also were not material. Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. There are no circumstances where revenue is recognized prior to delivery. Customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. We evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. With respect to collectability, we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers' financial condition. We defer revenue if any revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\nOur success and future revenue depend on our ability to achieve design wins and to convince our current and prospective customers to design our products into their product offerings. In addition, our revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors including customer demand and product life cycles, product cost and product mix sold during the period.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we first began to ship into the enterprise infrastructure market and began shipping in volume in 2015. Due to the introduction of our AQrate products, we anticipate that revenue from the enterprise infrastructure market will grow at a greater rate than revenue from the data center market over the next two years. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we started to sample our first access market products. We believe that the access market will represent a significant portion of our revenue in the near future.\nWe anticipate that our revenue will fluctuate based on a variety of factors including the amount and timing of customer and end-market demand, product life cycles, average selling price which declines as our product reaches maturity, production schedule, and product mix sold during the period. In addition, we may introduce new products at lower average selling price than our existing products with the intent of increasing the market demand for our products, which may cause a fluctuation in our revenues during the period in which these new products are introduced.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue consists of costs of materials, primarily wafers processed by third-party foundries, costs associated with packaging, assembly and testing paid to our third-party contract manufacturers, and personnel and other costs associated with our manufacturing operations. Our cost of revenue also includes allocation of overhead and facility costs, depreciation of production equipment, inventory write-downs and amortization of production mask costs. As we introduce new products, the cost of revenue will fluctuate depending on yield, volume and production cost of these products.\nGross Margin\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including product mix, ASPs, material costs, production costs that are themselves dependent upon improvements to yield, production efficiencies, elimination or addition to production processes as required by our end customers and timing of such improvements, and increasing manufacturing overhead to support the greater number of products and markets we serve.\nWe expect our gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in ASPs due to new product introductions, existing product transitions to high-volume manufacturing, product maturation and fluctuations in manufacturing costs.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, and a collaboration and development charge. Personnel costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs of facilities, information technology, depreciation and amortization. Although our operating expenses may fluctuate, we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time.\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Research and Development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, pre-production engineering mask costs, software license and intellectual property expenses, design tools and prototype-related expenses, facility costs, supplies and depreciation expense. We expense research and development costs as incurred. In addition, we enter into development agreements with some of our customers that provide fees that partially offset development costs. Such fees are recognized upon completion of the contract deliverables or milestones, and acceptance by the customer if required. We believe that continued investment in our products and services is important for our future growth and acquisition of new customers and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase on an absolute basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional and consulting fees and allocated overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our sales and marketing personnel and grow our international operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, professional and consulting fees, legal and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our operations and incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Collaboration and Development Charge. Collaboration and development charge in the first quarter of 2015 represents the fair value of a fully vested convertible preferred stock warrant exercisable for 975,616 shares of Series H convertible preferred stock, which was exercised in full on May 5, 2017. This warrant was issued to GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc., or GLOBALFOUNDRIES, at an exercise price of $0.10 per share in connection with a letter agreement to collaborate on the development of products that we plan to have manufactured by GLOBALFOUNDRIES upon qualification. As a result of the exercise of this warrant, we will not incur further such charges associated with this agreement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on our previously outstanding debt, change in fair value of convertible preferred stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about our debt and the repayment of such debt.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO, convertible preferred stock warrants were classified as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding change recorded as other income (expense). Upon the exercise of the warrants, the liability was reclassified to convertible preferred stock at their then fair value. In November 2017, upon the completion of the IPO, the warrants were converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the liability was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) at their then fair value, and will no longer be subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 1 and 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information.\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists primarily of state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of our deferred tax assets is uncertain, including net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, and tax credits\nrelated primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had NOL carryforwards of approximately $176.6 million and $102.4 million for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, respectively, and had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6.9 million and $7.9 million for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2025 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and begin to expire in 2018 for state income tax purposes. The U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2026 and the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.\nInternal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar California rules place a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than 50% in ownership). Generally, after a control change, a corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitations. Due to these provisions, utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. We completed Section 382 analysis and determined ownership changes occurred in July 2005, November 2009 and August 2017, which resulted in reductions to our U.S. federal and California net operating losses of $34.9 million and $24.1 million, respectively, and U.S. federal research and development credits by $1.8 million.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Act, was signed into legislation, making the most significant changes to the U.S. tax system since 1986. The Act, among other changes, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, implements a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries are in a cumulative deficit. Therefore, the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries has minimal impact on us. Due to the Act, we have remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. We recorded a provisional decrease related to our deferred tax assets and liabilities of $15.7 million with a corresponding adjustment to our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act including (a) provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (including related accounting policy elections) and (b) state tax implications of the Act. In addition, we are refining our calculations for certain estimated amounts above including the provisional amounts recorded for our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance. As our deferred tax asset is offset by a full valuation allowance, this change in rates had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented.

The increase in enterprise infrastructure market revenue was primarily due to $18.4 million in higher unit sales, offset by $4.4 million attributable to lower ASPs as products sold were transitioning to volume production. The decrease in data center market revenue was primarily due to $10.4 million in lower unit sales due to fluctuating customer demand, partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million attributable to higher ASP due to product mix. In particular, the decline in data center revenue was a result of our largest customer having concentrated its purchases in 2015 in order to build up inventory in that period, and selling that accumulated inventory during 2016. In addition, data center market revenue included the recognition of deferred revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.6 million as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as the deferred revenue was fully recognized by December 31, 2016.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nTable 177: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7,447\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12pts\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue decreased by $7.4 million, or 18% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015.

alternative minimum tax that was reduced by available credits. Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was (61)% compared to (2)% for the year ended December 31, 2015 mainly due to a smaller loss before income tax balance. The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions and in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, offset by the impact of higher state taxes and research and development credit.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from product sales, proceeds from our convertible preferred stock and debt financings and our IPO in November 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $56.4 million. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations to support our growth.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flows from product sales, and funds available for borrowing under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the longer term, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. In the event that we need to borrow funds or issue additional equity, we cannot assure you that any such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, any future borrowings may result in additional restrictions on our business and any issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to investors. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, it would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 183: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,509\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,138\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (11,512\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54,043\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (8,431\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,174\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,104\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (20,853\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5,397\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nWe have historically used cash in operating activities primarily due to our net losses, adjusted for changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. In addition, cash in operating activities are adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, issuance of convertible preferred stock warrants, the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability and amortization of our debt discount.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in operating activities was approximately $11.5 million. The cash used in operating activities was primarily due to $14.1 million in net decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, of which $11.5 million were used to increase inventories for the anticipation of product demands in multiple markets, and net loss of $5.4 million, offset by non-cash expenses of $8.0 million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was approximately $12.1 million. The cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of decreased inventories of $9.6 million as product revenue increased, non-cash items totaling $5.4 million, offset by other changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.4 million, net loss of $0.4 million, and decrease in deferred revenue of $2.1 million primarily from the recognition of previously recorded deferred revenue related to a significant agreement with Intel.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we used approximately $11.5 million of cash in operating activities. The cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of increased inventories of $12.7 million to support our future product sales, our net loss of $10.0 million offset by non-cash items totaling $14.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $5.2 million due to increased product sales during 2015, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.7 million primarily from the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to a significant agreement with Intel. The cash used in operating activities was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.4 million primarily due to higher compensation and benefit accruals resulting from increased headcount and increased professional services costs, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.3 million. Non-cash items included $12.1 million for the issuance of convertible preferred stock warrants primarily related to a collaboration and development charge, $1.9 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.2 million amortization of debt discount and non-cash interest expense, and $0.8 million of stock compensation expense, offset by a $1.6 million revaluation of our convertible preferred stock warrants.\nInvesting Activities\nOur investing activities consist of available-for-sale investment activities, capital expenditures for property and equipment purchases and IP licenses. Our capital expenditures for property and equipment have primarily been for general business purposes, including machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements, software and computer equipment used internally, and production masks to manufacture our products.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we used approximately $54.0 million in investing activities, of which $48.5 million was invested in available-for-sale investments and $5.6 million for the purchases of property and equipment for general business purposes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 we used approximately $8.4 million in investing activities for the purchase of production masks, IP licenses and other property and equipment for general business purposes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we used approximately $4.2 million in investing activities for the purchase of production masks and other property and equipment for general business purposes.\nFinancing Activities\nCash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from the recently completed IPO, proceeds from our issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises borrowings under our credit facilities, and issuance of convertible preferred stock. Cash used in financing activities includes repayment of debt under our credit facilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $44.7 million of cash from financing activities, consisting of proceeds of $65.6 million proceeds from our IPO, $1.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and preferred stock warrants, offset by net repayment of our borrowings of $19.2 million and payments of $2.9 million of costs related to the IPO.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $9.1 million of cash in financing activities, consisting of $11.6 million used in repayments of our line of credit and borrowings and payments of $2.4 million on costs related to\nour IPO completed in November 2017, partially offset by $4.9 million proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and preferred stock warrants.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $43.0 million of cash from financing activities, consisting of $37.0 million of cash from the issuance of our Series H convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs, $20.2 million from our line of credit and $1.4 million from the issuance of common stock, primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options; offset by the repayment of $15.2 million on our line of credit, $0.2 million of debt issuance costs and $0.2 million of costs related to our IPO completed in November 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our outstanding balance on our line of credit ranged from $0 to $10.3 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nSet forth below is information concerning our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 184: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments due by period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,780\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,113\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, our operating lease obligations are for our U.S. headquarters and our international research facilities that expire at various dates through March 2024. Purchase obligations consist of non-cancelable agreements and purchase orders for goods and services. See Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our audited consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe primarily sell our products direct to our customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors. We offer a limited number of customer rebates and accrue an estimate of such rebates at the time revenue is recognized. Such rebates were not material in any of the periods presented, and the differences between the actual amount of such rebates and our estimates also were not material. Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is\nreasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. There are no circumstances where revenue is recognized prior to delivery. Customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. We evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. With respect to collectability, we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers' financial condition. We defer revenue if any revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\nIn 2017, a portion of our product sales was made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and rights of return. These pricing credits and right of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of the product to be sold and the amount of product that could be returned pursuant to these agreements. As a result, the fixed and determinable revenue recognition criterion has not been met at the time we deliver products to our distributors. Accordingly, product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers. The amount of deferred revenue and deferred cost related to the sales through distributors was not significant as of December 31, 2017.\nInventories\nInventories consist of processed wafers, work-in-process and finished goods and are stated at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Standard costs approximate actual costs and are based on a first-in, first-out basis. We perform detailed reviews of the net realizable value of inventories, both on hand as well as for inventories that we are committed to purchase and write down the inventory value for estimated deterioration, excess and obsolete and other factors based on management's assessment of future demand and market conditions. Once written down, inventory write-downs are not reversed until the inventory is sold or scrapped. If market conditions are less favorable, we may be required to take additional inventory write-downs, which could adversely impact our gross margin and operating results.\nConvertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\nWe account for our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants as derivative liabilities as the terms of the warrants are not fixed due to potential adjustments in the exercise price and the number of shares upon an equity financing at a lower price. The convertible preferred stock warrants are initially recorded at fair value when issued, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each period end while such instruments are outstanding and classified as liabilities. Upon the exercise of the warrants, the liability was reclassified to convertible preferred stock at their then fair value. Upon the completion of the IPO, the warrants were converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the liability was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) at their then fair value, and will no longer be subject to fair value accounting. The fair values of the convertible preferred stock warrants issued in connection with debt agreements are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized as non-cash interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the expected repayment period of the debt agreements. The fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrants issued in connection with a letter agreement to collaborate on the development of products in 2015 was recorded as an operating expense at the date of issuance.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants relate to the weighted-average assumptions from January 1, 2017 through November 3, 2017 when our convertible preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock warrants, and for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Black-Scholes\nPricing Model\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Black-Scholes Pricing Model\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.89%-2.24%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39%-2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4 - 7.9 yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3 - 9.0 yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25% - 35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25% - 50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of preferred stock:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series C-1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series F\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series G\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series H\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStock-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions is measured and recognized in the financial statements at fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of each equity award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognize the related stock-based compensation expense on the straight-line method. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.\nWe account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair value of the awards determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of such instruments is recognized as an expense over the period in which the related services are received.\nWe estimated the fair value of stock-based awards granted using the following valuation assumptions:\nTable 186: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.89%-2.40%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.46%-2.43%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.51%-2.32%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1 - 10 yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.1 - 10 yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3 - 10 yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26% - 30%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30% - 34%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41% - 42%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes the effects of stock-based compensation on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 187: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.8 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 3.1 years.\nThe intrinsic value of all outstanding options as of December 31, 2017 was $25.4 million based on the closing stock price of $11.33 as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nPrior to the IPO in November 2017, our board of directors determined the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options. The board of directors granted options to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on each grant date.\nThe common stock valuations were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The assumptions we use in the valuation model are based on future expectations combined with management judgment. Our board of directors is comprised of a majority of non-employee directors who we believe have the relevant experience and expertise to determine a fair value of our common stock on each respective grant date. In the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, our board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the common stock's fair value as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:\nTable 188: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> valuations performed by an unrelated third-party specialist;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to the common stock;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our operating and financial performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> current business conditions and projections;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our history and the introduction of new products and services;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our stage of development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the hiring of key personnel;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions at the time;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> U.S. and global capital market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt each grant date, our board of directors reviewed any recent events and their potential impact on the estimated fair value per share of the common stock. For grants of stock awards made on dates for which there was no valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common\nstock on the date of grant based upon the immediately preceding valuation and other pertinent information available to it at the time of grant.\nOur common stock valuation models have historically utilized a market approach, which bases the valuation of our common stock on multiples of revenue, operating income, net income and similar metrics of publicly traded companies we believe are similar to us in terms of size, product market, liquidity, financial leverage, revenue, profitability, growth and other factors. We also examine transactions in the same or similar assets at the measurement date. These transactions can include venture investments in private firms, or stock market trading prices of similar publicly traded companies.\nWe also allocate value to each class of stock using an Option Pricing Model, or OPM, and Probability Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM. The OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on an enterprise value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock. The common stock is modeled as a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after our convertible preferred stock is liquidated. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is difficult to predict and thus creates highly speculative forecasts. PWERM involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise. This method is particularly useful when discrete future outcomes can be predicted at a relatively high confidence level with a probability distribution. Discrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM include an initial public offering, or IPO, as well as non-IPO market based outcomes. Determining the fair value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires us to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an IPO liquidity event and non-IPO outcomes, as well as the values we expect those outcomes could yield. We apply significant judgment in developing these assumptions and estimates, primarily based upon the enterprise value we determined using the market approach, our knowledge of the business and our reasonable expectations of discrete outcomes occurring.\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our common stock, our board of directors also considered the fact that our stockholders could not freely trade our common stock in the public markets. Accordingly, we applied discounts to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock based on the expected time to liquidity. The estimated fair value of our common stock at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount partially based on the anticipated likelihood and timing of a future liquidity event.\nThe key subjective factors and assumptions used in our valuations primarily consisted of: (1) the selection of the appropriate market comparable transactions, (2) the selection of the appropriate comparable publicly traded companies, (3) the financial forecasts utilized to determine future cash balances and necessary capital requirements, (4) the probability and timing of the various possible liquidity events, (5) the estimated weighted-average cost of capital and (6) the discount for lack of marketability of our common stock.\nFollowing the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the grant date.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nA tax position can be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. It provides clarity and reduces both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements will be significant.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new guidance requires entities to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with terms of more than 12 months and additional disclosures to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) related to the recognition and reporting of revenue that establishes a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. We intend to use the modified retrospective method. Under the new standards, we do not expect an impact for revenue to our end customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors; however, we anticipate an impact on the timing for its distributor transactions. Under the new standard, we will recognize all revenue on sales to distributors upon shipment and transfer of control (known as sell-in\u201d revenue recognition), rather than deferring recognition until distributor report that they have sold the product to their customers (known as sell-through\u201d revenue recognition). This change in methodology will cause a shift in the timing of when revenue is recognized for this class of customers. We recently started providing its distributors rights that would result in a deferral of revenue under the current revenue standards. Accordingly, we anticipate deferred revenue of $0.1 million will be recorded to accumulated deficits upon adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nAdopted\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value\u201d, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). This standard will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB, issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This guidance affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The guidance is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions which include: the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeiture rate calculations. The guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230), which provides guidance for eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. We early adopted this guidance in 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not result in any adjustments.\nJOBS Act Transition Period\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted in April 2012. Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.", "item_7_truncated": "\n \u2022 the hiring of key personnel; \nTable 173: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for (benefit from) income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (117\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (285\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (170\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.6 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million in personnel-related costs as we increased our headcount to support our growth, and an increase of $0.2 million in consulting fees and third party commissions.\nTable 185: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Valuation method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Black-Scholes\nPricing Model\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Black-Scholes Pricing Model\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.89%-2.24%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.39%-2.25%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected term\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4 - 7.9 yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3 - 9.0 yrs\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25% - 35%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25% - 50%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fair value of preferred stock:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series A\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series B\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series C-1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series D\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.80\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series E\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series F\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series G\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Convertible preferred Series H\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2017, our operating lease obligations are for our U.S. headquarters and our international research facilities that expire at various dates through March 2024.

of our products. We sell our products direct to our customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors, and do not currently have a material amount of revenue sold to distributors during the sales process. We offer a limited number of customer rebates and accrue an estimate of such rebates at the time revenue is recognized. Such rebates were not material in any of the periods presented, and the differences between the actual amount of such rebates and our estimates also were not material. Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. There are no circumstances where revenue is recognized prior to delivery. Customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. We evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. With respect to collectability, we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers' financial condition. We defer revenue if any revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\nTable 175: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue by market\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Data center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 64,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,549\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8,525\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Enterprise infrastructure\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Access\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 80,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,868\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe common stock valuations were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation.

This guidance affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The guidance is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions which include: the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeiture rate calculations. The guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nOperating Expenses\nTable 180: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income (expense):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,334\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,321\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of convertible preferred\nstock warrant liability\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (544\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,135\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other income (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,864\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,725\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2,139\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> *\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSet forth below is information concerning our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 182: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (32\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome tax expense decreased by $32,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. alternative minimum tax that was reduced by available credits. Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was (61)% compared to (2)% for the year ended December 31, 2015 mainly due to a smaller loss before income tax balance. The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions and in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, offset by the impact of higher state taxes and research and development credit.\nCost of revenue decreased by $7.4 million, or 18% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to savings from yield improvements achieved through quality assurance processes with our manufacturers and cost reductions from our supply chain achieved through negotiation on production and material costs, partially offset by the higher direct operations costs of managing a greater number of products across multiple markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we used approximately $11.5 million of cash in operating activities. The cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of increased inventories of $12.7 million to support our future product sales, our net loss of $10.0 million offset by non-cash items totaling $14.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $5.2 million due to increased product sales during 2015, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.7 million primarily from the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to a significant agreement with Intel. The cash used in operating activities was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.4 million primarily due to higher compensation and benefit accruals resulting from increased headcount and increased professional services costs, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.3 million. Non-cash items included $12.1 million for the issuance of convertible preferred stock warrants primarily related to a collaboration and development charge, $1.9 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.2 million amortization of debt discount and non-cash interest expense, and $0.8 million of stock compensation expense, offset by a $1.6 million revaluation of our convertible preferred stock warrants.\nInternal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar California rules place a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than 50% in ownership). Generally, after a control change, a corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitations. Due to these provisions, utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. We completed Section 382 analysis and determined ownership changes occurred in July 2005, November 2009 and August 2017, which resulted in reductions to our U.S. federal and California net operating losses of $34.9 million and $24.1 million, respectively, and U.S. federal research and development credits by $1.8 million.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated:\n\nCash Flows\nRevenue\nResearch and development expenses increased $11.3 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $5.3 million in personnel-related costs as we continued to expand our research and development headcount, an increase of $1.1 million in design tools and prototype-related expenses and $4.8 million decrease in product development fees received from our customers in 2015, which fees offset our research and development costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Act, was signed into legislation, making the most significant changes to the U.S. tax system since 1986. The Act, among other changes, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, implements a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries are in a cumulative deficit. Therefore, the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries has minimal impact on us. Due to the Act, we have remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. We recorded a provisional decrease related to our deferred tax assets and liabilities of $15.7 million with a corresponding adjustment to our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act including (a) provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (including related accounting policy elections) and (b) state tax implications of the Act. In addition, we are refining our calculations for certain estimated amounts above including the provisional amounts recorded for our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance. As our deferred tax asset is offset by a full valuation allowance, this change in rates had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe shipped our first products in 2009. Historically, a substantial majority of our revenue has been generated from our largest customer, Intel, including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of this customer in the data center server market, in particular the server portion of that market in support of our relationship with Intel. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Intel accounted for 60%, 68% and 78% and Cisco accounted for 28%, 21% and 13% of our revenue, respectively. Our 10 largest customers collectively accounted for 97%, 98% and 98% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we acquire new customers and sell additional products to our existing customers. While we intend to expand our customer base over time, the markets we serve tend to be highly concentrated, and we expect that a large portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future. As the markets expand, the market share of our largest customers may not increase proportionally or may decrease as competition enters into the market. This has in the past materially impacted our revenues and our market share, and it may continue to do so in the future until the diversification of our customer base lessens the impact of this significant customer concentration.\nWe have historically used cash in operating activities primarily due to our net losses, adjusted for changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. In addition, cash in operating activities are adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, issuance of convertible preferred stock warrants, the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability and amortization of our debt discount.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our common stock, our board of directors also considered the fact that our stockholders could not freely trade our common stock in the public markets. Accordingly, we applied discounts to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock based on the expected time to liquidity. The estimated fair value of our common stock at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount partially based on the anticipated likelihood and timing of a future liquidity event.\nCost of revenue increased by $10.3 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to $7.7 million of product costs on higher revenue and $2.5 million increase related to product mix, offset by the sales of products previously reserved.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \nWe anticipate that our revenue will fluctuate based on a variety of factors including the amount and timing of customer and end-market demand, product life cycles, average selling price which declines as our product reaches maturity, production schedule, and product mix sold during the period. In addition, we may introduce new products at lower average selling price than our existing products with the intent of increasing the market demand for our products, which may cause a fluctuation in our revenues during the period in which these new products are introduced.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we used approximately $54.0 million in investing activities, of which $48.5 million was invested in available-for-sale investments and $5.6 million for the purchases of property and equipment for general business purposes.\n\n \u2022 U.S. and global capital market conditions. \nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair value of the awards determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of such instruments is recognized as an expense over the period in which the related services are received.\nOur common stock valuation models have historically utilized a market approach, which bases the valuation of our common stock on multiples of revenue, operating income, net income and similar metrics of publicly traded companies we believe are similar to us in terms of size, product market, liquidity, financial leverage, revenue, profitability, growth and other factors. We also examine transactions in the same or similar assets at the measurement date. These transactions can include venture investments in private firms, or stock market trading prices of similar publicly traded companies.\n</td> </tr>\nOur investing activities consist of available-for-sale investment activities, capital expenditures for property and equipment purchases and IP licenses. Our capital expenditures for property and equipment have primarily been for general business purposes, including machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements, software and computer equipment used internally, and production masks to manufacture our products.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \nWe also allocate value to each class of stock using an Option Pricing Model, or OPM, and Probability Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM. The OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on an enterprise value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock. The common stock is modeled as a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after our convertible preferred stock is liquidated. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is difficult to predict and thus creates highly speculative forecasts. PWERM involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise. This method is particularly useful when discrete future outcomes can be predicted at a relatively high confidence level with a probability distribution. Discrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM include an initial public offering, or IPO, as well as non-IPO market based outcomes. Determining the fair value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires us to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an IPO liquidity event and non-IPO outcomes, as well as the values we expect those outcomes could yield. We apply significant judgment in developing these assumptions and estimates, primarily based upon the enterprise value we determined using the market approach, our knowledge of the business and our reasonable expectations of discrete outcomes occurring.\nInvesting Activities\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO, convertible preferred stock warrants were classified as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding change recorded as other income (expense). Upon the exercise of the warrants, the liability was reclassified to convertible preferred stock at their then fair value. In November 2017, upon the completion of the IPO, the warrants were converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the liability was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) at their then fair value, and will no longer be subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 1 and 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.9 million, or 40%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases of $1.1 million for legal, consulting and audit fees, $0.8 million for personnel-related costs and $0.4 million in depreciation expense.\nAt each grant date, our board of directors reviewed any recent events and their potential impact on the estimated fair value per share of the common stock. For grants of stock awards made on dates for which there was no valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common\nInventories consist of processed wafers, work-in-process and finished goods and are stated at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Standard costs approximate actual costs and are based on a first-in, first-out basis. We perform detailed reviews of the net realizable value of inventories, both on hand as well as for inventories that we are committed to purchase and write down the inventory value for estimated deterioration, excess and obsolete and other factors based on management's assessment of future demand and market conditions. Once written down, inventory write-downs are not reversed until the inventory is sold or scrapped. If market conditions are less favorable, we may be required to take additional inventory write-downs, which could adversely impact our gross margin and operating results.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nPrior to the IPO in November 2017, our board of directors determined the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options. The board of directors granted options to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on each grant date.\n \u2022 our stage of development; \nrelated primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not.\n \u2022 Collaboration and Development Charge. Collaboration and development charge in the first quarter of 2015 represents the fair value of a fully vested convertible preferred stock warrant exercisable for 975,616 shares of Series H convertible preferred stock, which was exercised in full on May 5, 2017. This warrant was issued to GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc., or GLOBALFOUNDRIES, at an exercise price of $0.10 per share in connection with a letter agreement to collaborate on the development of products that we plan to have manufactured by GLOBALFOUNDRIES upon qualification. As a result of the exercise of this warrant, we will not incur further such charges associated with this agreement. \nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted in April 2012. Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \nGross Margin\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 we used approximately $8.4 million in investing activities for the purchase of production masks, IP licenses and other property and equipment for general business purposes.\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. It provides clarity and reduces both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements will be significant.\nGross profit increased by $13.3 million, or 34%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our gross margin increased by 12 percentage points. Adjusted for the $3.1 million and $1.6 million of the aforementioned deferred revenue recognized in each period which is non-recurring after June 2016, our adjusted gross margin would have been 47% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, resulting in 13 percentage points increase. The increase in gross margin was due to yield improvement and cost reductions from our supply chain.\nRevenue Recognition\n\nIncome Tax Expense\nPricing and Product Cost. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the ICs we provide to our customers. We believe the primary driver of gross margin is the average selling prices, or ASPs, negotiated between us and our customers relative to volume, material costs and manufacturing yield. Typically, our selling prices are contractually set for multiple quarters and our prototype selling prices are higher than our selling prices at volume production. In certain cases, we have agreed in advance to modest price reductions, generally over a period of time ranging from 18 months to five years, once the specified product begins to ship in volume. However, our customers may change their purchase orders and demand forecasts at any time with limited notice, which can sometimes lead to price renegotiations. Although these price renegotiations can sometimes result in ASPs of our products fluctuating over the shorter term, we expect ASPs generally to decline over the longer term as our products mature. These declines often coincide with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly and testing costs, which offset some or all of the margin reduction that results from lower ASPs. Since we rely on third-party wafer foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our ICs, we maintain a close relationship with our suppliers to improve quality, increase yields and lower manufacturing costs. In addition, our customers may seek to renegotiate product pricing under the contracts or purchase orders we have with them based on volume or other factors, which could drive fluctuations in ASPs.\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on our previously outstanding debt, change in fair value of convertible preferred stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about our debt and the repayment of such debt.\nCost of Revenue\nIncome tax expense consists primarily of state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of our deferred tax assets is uncertain, including net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, and tax credits\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRevenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.8 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in personnel-related costs.\n \u2022 the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; \nWe derive revenue from our products, which include our 10GBASE-T physical layer devices, or PHYs, custom ASICs for Intel and our recently developed AQrate product line. We currently generate revenue from the sale of our products directly to IC suppliers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and original design manufacturers, or ODMs. We market and sell our products through our direct sales force.\nOther Income (Expense)\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nResults of Operations\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2017, a portion of our product sales was made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and rights of return. These pricing credits and right of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of the product to be sold and the amount of product that could be returned pursuant to these agreements. As a result, the fixed and determinable revenue recognition criterion has not been met at the time we deliver products to our distributors. Accordingly, product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers. The amount of deferred revenue and deferred cost related to the sales through distributors was not significant as of December 31, 2017.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) related to the recognition and reporting of revenue that establishes a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. We intend to use the modified retrospective method. Under the new standards, we do not expect an impact for revenue to our end customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors; however, we anticipate an impact on the timing for its distributor transactions. Under the new standard, we will recognize all revenue on sales to distributors upon shipment and transfer of control (known as sell-in\u201d revenue recognition), rather than deferring recognition until distributor report that they have sold the product to their customers (known as sell-through\u201d revenue recognition). This change in methodology will cause a shift in the timing of when revenue is recognized for this class of customers. We recently started providing its distributors rights that would result in a deferral of revenue under the current revenue standards. Accordingly, we anticipate deferred revenue of $0.1 million will be recorded to accumulated deficits upon adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n \n * Percentage change not meaningful \nCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions is measured and recognized in the financial statements at fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of each equity award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognize the related stock-based compensation expense on the straight-line method. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.\nItem 7.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a research credit benefit from a foreign tax jurisdiction, offset by higher income tax related to our foreign subsidiaries and a credit not anticipated to be benefitted.\n \u2022 our operating and financial performance; \nResearch and development expenses increased $8.2 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase of $3.7 million in personnel-related costs as we continued to expand our research and development headcount, $2.2 million in design tools and prototype-related expenses, $1.3 million in depreciation and amortization related to lab equipment and licenses and $0.5 million in stock-based compensation.\n \u2022 the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to the common stock; \nOther Income (Expense)\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation as we begin to serve many markets and end-markets which historically experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year which may result in slower growth and lower sales as compared to other quarters.\nComponents of Results of Operations\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe estimated the fair value of stock-based awards granted using the following valuation assumptions:\nRevenue increased by $5.9 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $14.2 million, or 172%, attributable to an increase in enterprise infrastructure market revenue, offset by a decrease of $8.5 million in data center market revenue. The increase in enterprise infrastructure market revenue was primarily due to $18.4 million in higher unit sales, offset by $4.4 million attributable to lower ASPs as products sold were transitioning to volume production. The decrease in data center market revenue was primarily due to $10.4 million in lower unit sales due to fluctuating customer demand, partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million attributable to higher ASP due to product mix. In particular, the decline in data center revenue was a result of our largest customer having concentrated its purchases in 2015 in order to build up inventory in that period, and selling that accumulated inventory during 2016. In addition, data center market revenue included the recognition of deferred revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.6 million as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as the deferred revenue was fully recognized by December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $43.0 million of cash from financing activities, consisting of $37.0 million of cash from the issuance of our Series H convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs, $20.2 million from our line of credit and $1.4 million from the issuance of common stock, primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options; offset by the repayment of $15.2 million on our line of credit, $0.2 million of debt issuance costs and $0.2 million of costs related to our IPO completed in November 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our outstanding balance on our line of credit ranged from $0 to $10.3 million.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \n \u2022 our history and the introduction of new products and services; \nCost of revenue consists of costs of materials, primarily wafers processed by third-party foundries, costs associated with packaging, assembly and testing paid to our third-party contract manufacturers, and personnel and other costs associated with our manufacturing operations. Our cost of revenue also includes allocation of overhead and facility costs, depreciation of production equipment, inventory write-downs and amortization of production mask costs. As we introduce new products, the cost of revenue will fluctuate depending on yield, volume and production cost of these products.\n \u2022 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, professional and consulting fees, legal and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our operations and incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company. \n\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe also carefully monitor changes in customer demand and end-market demand, including seasonality, cyclicality and the competitive landscape. Our customers share their development schedules with us, including the projected launch dates of their product offerings. Once our customers are in production, they generally will provide nine to 12-month forecasts of expected demand, which gives us an indication of future demand. However, our customers may change their purchase orders and demand forecasts at any time with limited notice. In light of our significant customer concentration, our revenue is likely to be materially and disproportionally, due in part to fluctuating end-market demand, impacted by the purchasing decisions of our largest customers.\n\n \u2022 valuations performed by an unrelated third-party specialist; \nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we first began to ship into the enterprise infrastructure market and began shipping in volume in 2015. Due to the introduction of our AQrate products, we anticipate that revenue from the enterprise infrastructure market will grow at a greater rate than revenue from the data center market over the next two years. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we started to sample our first access market products. We believe that the access market will represent a significant portion of our revenue in the near future.\nstock on the date of grant based upon the immediately preceding valuation and other pertinent information available to it at the time of grant.\n\n \u2022 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional and consulting fees and allocated overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our sales and marketing personnel and grow our international operations. \nCustomer Demand and Product Life Cycles. Once customers design our ICs into their products, we closely monitor all phases of the product life cycle, including the initial design phase, prototype production, volume production and inventories. For example, during the periods presented, we had several products progressing through their product life cycles. In the data center market, the majority of our revenue for the periods presented was derived from our 10GBASE-T custom ASIC product, which we refer to as Twinville. In late 2015, we introduced and began to record revenue from our Sageville and Coppervale products. We anticipate that our Twinville product will transition to these two newer ASIC products over time, although the timing and rate of such transition will depend on our customers' adoption of these products and the demand for our customers' products. In the enterprise infrastructure market, during the periods presented, we developed our 5GBASE-T and 2.5GBASE-T AQrate product. We first shipped our AQrate products into the enterprise infrastructure market in the fourth quarter of 2014. We began shipping AQrate products in volume in 2015 and 2016. We also started to ship our multiple lines of products into the access market in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect the revenue from our AQrate products, and therefore the percentage of our total revenue attributable to the enterprise infrastructure and access markets, to increase from the current levels.\n\nOperating Activities\nWe are a fabless semiconductor company. We have shipped more than 10 million ports to customers across three semiconductor process generations, and are currently in mass production in 28nm process node. 28nm and other silicon process geometries, such as 40nm and 90nm, refer to the size of the process node in nanometers for a particular semiconductor manufacturing process. Our end customers include Aruba (acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in 2015), Brocade, Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Intel, Juniper, Oracle and Ruckus (acquired by Brocade in 2016). For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue was $103.4 million, $86.7 million and $80.8 million, respectively, our net loss was $5.4 million, $0.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and our non-GAAP net income (loss) was $(2.7) million, $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. See Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $9.1 million of cash in financing activities, consisting of $11.6 million used in repayments of our line of credit and borrowings and payments of $2.4 million on costs related to\nJOBS Act Transition Period\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.8 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 3.1 years.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAdopted\nWe account for our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants as derivative liabilities as the terms of the warrants are not fixed due to potential adjustments in the exercise price and the number of shares upon an equity financing at a lower price. The convertible preferred stock warrants are initially recorded at fair value when issued, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each period end while such instruments are outstanding and classified as liabilities. Upon the exercise of the warrants, the liability was reclassified to convertible preferred stock at their then fair value. Upon the completion of the IPO, the warrants were converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the liability was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) at their then fair value, and will no longer be subject to fair value accounting. The fair values of the convertible preferred stock warrants issued in connection with debt agreements are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized as non-cash interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the expected repayment period of the debt agreements. The fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrants issued in connection with a letter agreement to collaborate on the development of products in 2015 was recorded as an operating expense at the date of issuance.\nConvertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\n\n \u2022 any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock; and \nInventories\nIncome Tax Expense\n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions at the time; \nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants relate to the weighted-average assumptions from January 1, 2017 through November 3, 2017 when our convertible preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock warrants, and for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our audited consolidated financial statements are described below.\n \u2022 current business conditions and projections; \n \u2022 Research and Development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, pre-production engineering mask costs, software license and intellectual property expenses, design tools and prototype-related expenses, facility costs, supplies and depreciation expense. We expense research and development costs as incurred. In addition, we enter into development agreements with some of our customers that provide fees that partially offset development costs. Such fees are recognized upon completion of the contract deliverables or milestones, and acceptance by the customer if required. We believe that continued investment in our products and services is important for our future growth and acquisition of new customers and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase on an absolute basis. \nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230), which provides guidance for eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. We early adopted this guidance in 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not result in any adjustments.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flows from product sales, and funds available for borrowing under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the longer term, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. In the event that we need to borrow funds or issue additional equity, we cannot assure you that any such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, any future borrowings may result in additional restrictions on our business and any issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to investors. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, it would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.9 million, or 35%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $1.4 million due to higher headcount and marketing tradeshow costs of $0.3 million.\nOur success and future revenue depend on our ability to achieve design wins and to convince our current and prospective customers to design our products into their product offerings. In addition, our revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors including customer demand and product life cycles, product cost and product mix sold during the period.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nGross profit increased by $6.4 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our gross margin decreased by 4%. The gross margin decrease was primarily due to higher product cost related to product mix, which approximated 2.6% and the impact of $1.6 million of the aforementioned deferred revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016, which approximated 1.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe are a leader in the design, development and marketing of advanced high-speed communications integrated circuits, or ICs, for Ethernet connectivity in the data center, enterprise infrastructure and access markets. Our Ethernet solutions provide a critical interface between the high-speed analog signals transported over wired infrastructure and the digital information used in computing and networking equipment. Our products are designed to cost-effectively deliver leading-edge data speeds for use in the latest generation of communications infrastructure to alleviate network bandwidth bottlenecks caused by the exponential growth of global Internet Protocol, or IP, traffic. Many of our semiconductor solutions have established benchmarks in the industry in terms of performance, power consumption and density. Our innovative solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings, position themselves to gain market share and drive the ongoing equipment infrastructure upgrade cycles in the data center, enterprise infrastructure and access markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we used approximately $4.2 million in investing activities for the purchase of production masks and other property and equipment for general business purposes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in operating activities was approximately $11.5 million. The cash used in operating activities was primarily due to $14.1 million in net decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, of which $11.5 million were used to increase inventories for the anticipation of product demands in multiple markets, and net loss of $5.4 million, offset by non-cash expenses of $8.0 million.\nFollowing the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the grant date.\nSeasonality\n\nA tax position can be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nreasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. There are no circumstances where revenue is recognized prior to delivery. Customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. We evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. With respect to collectability, we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers' financial condition. We defer revenue if any revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\nWe primarily sell our products direct to our customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors. We offer a limited number of customer rebates and accrue an estimate of such rebates at the time revenue is recognized. Such rebates were not material in any of the periods presented, and the differences between the actual amount of such rebates and our estimates also were not material. Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for future periods.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $44.7 million of cash from financing activities, consisting of proceeds of $65.6 million proceeds from our IPO, $1.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and preferred stock warrants, offset by net repayment of our borrowings of $19.2 million and payments of $2.9 million of costs related to the IPO.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $1.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to lower interest expense of $1.6 million as the principal of debt was repaid in November 2017, offset by an increase in the fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability, a non-cash expense.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nOperating Expenses\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this report. See also the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nWe expect our gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in ASPs due to new product introductions, existing product transitions to high-volume manufacturing, product maturation and fluctuations in manufacturing costs.\nOverview\nDesign Wins with New and Existing Customers. Our existing and prospective customers tend to be multinational enterprises with large annual purchases of ICs that are continuously developing new products for existing and new application areas. Our solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings and position themselves to gain market share and drive the next upgrade cycles in data center and enterprise infrastructure. We have programs in place to help our existing customers use our solutions throughout their product portfolio, and we work closely with our existing and prospective customers to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. Because of our extended sales cycle, our revenue in future years is highly dependent on design wins we are awarded today. Further, because we expect our revenue relating to our mature products to decline in the future, we consider design wins critical to our future success and anticipate being increasingly dependent on revenue from newer design wins for our newer products.\nThe key subjective factors and assumptions used in our valuations primarily consisted of: (1) the selection of the appropriate market comparable transactions, (2) the selection of the appropriate comparable publicly traded companies, (3) the financial forecasts utilized to determine future cash balances and necessary capital requirements, (4) the probability and timing of the various possible liquidity events, (5) the estimated weighted-average cost of capital and (6) the discount for lack of marketability of our common stock.\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nCollaboration and development charge represents the fair value of a fully vested warrant to purchase 975,616 shares of Series H convertible preferred stock issued to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 2015, which was subsequently exercised in full on May 5, 2017.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from product sales, proceeds from our convertible preferred stock and debt financings and our IPO in November 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $56.4 million. Our principal use of cash is to fund our operations to support our growth.", "item_7_text": "\n \u2022 the hiring of key personnel; \nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.6 million, or 42%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $1.0 million in personnel-related costs as we increased our headcount to support our growth, and an increase of $0.2 million in consulting fees and third party commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2017, our operating lease obligations are for our U.S. headquarters and our international research facilities that expire at various dates through March 2024. Purchase obligations consist of non-cancelable agreements and purchase orders for goods and services. See Note 6 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional information.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory, which requires entities to measure most inventory at the lower of cost and net realizable value\u201d, thereby simplifying the current guidance under which an entity must measure inventory at the lower of cost or market (market in this context is defined as one of three different measures, one of which is net realizable value). This standard will be effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The new guidance requires entities to recognize assets and liabilities for leases with terms of more than 12 months and additional disclosures to better understand the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. The guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. We are evaluating the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had NOL carryforwards of approximately $176.6 million and $102.4 million for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, respectively, and had research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $6.9 million and $7.9 million for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. The NOL carryforwards begin to expire in 2025 for U.S. federal income tax purposes and begin to expire in 2018 for state income tax purposes. The U.S. federal tax credit carryforwards begin to expire in 2026 and the state tax credits carry forward indefinitely.\nRevenue increased by $16.7 million, or 19%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily attributable to $12.7 million increase in product sold to the enterprise infrastructure market and $3.0 million increase in product sales sold to the access market, a new market we entered into since the fourth quarter of 2016, and a $2.4 million increase in data center product sales as customers transitioned from 40nm products to 28nm products net of lower average selling price, offset by a $1.6 million impact on non-recurring deferred revenue recognized in data center market for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses, and a collaboration and development charge. Personnel costs are the most significant component of our operating expenses and consist of salaries, benefits, bonuses, stock-based compensation and commissions. Our operating expenses also include allocated costs of facilities, information technology, depreciation and amortization. Although our operating expenses may fluctuate, we expect our overall operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars over time.\nCash generated by financing activities includes proceeds from the recently completed IPO, proceeds from our issuance of common stock following employee stock option exercises borrowings under our credit facilities, and issuance of convertible preferred stock. Cash used in financing activities includes repayment of debt under our credit facilities.\nRevenue\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe intrinsic value of all outstanding options as of December 31, 2017 was $25.4 million based on the closing stock price of $11.33 as reported on the New York Stock Exchange.\nOther income (expense) for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $2.1 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the change in fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was approximately $12.1 million. The cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of decreased inventories of $9.6 million as product revenue increased, non-cash items totaling $5.4 million, offset by other changes in operating assets and liabilities of $0.4 million, net loss of $0.4 million, and decrease in deferred revenue of $2.1 million primarily from the recognition of previously recorded deferred revenue related to a significant agreement with Intel.\nThe following table summarizes the effects of stock-based compensation on our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\n\nour IPO completed in November 2017, partially offset by $4.9 million proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and preferred stock warrants.\nGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been, and will continue to be, affected by a variety of factors, including product mix, ASPs, material costs, production costs that are themselves dependent upon improvements to yield, production efficiencies, elimination or addition to production processes as required by our end customers and timing of such improvements, and increasing manufacturing overhead to support the greater number of products and markets we serve.\nFinancing Activities\nWe generate revenue from the sale of our products. We sell our products direct to our customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors, and do not currently have a material amount of revenue sold to distributors during the sales process. We offer a limited number of customer rebates and accrue an estimate of such rebates at the time revenue is recognized. Such rebates were not material in any of the periods presented, and the differences between the actual amount of such rebates and our estimates also were not material. Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. There are no circumstances where revenue is recognized prior to delivery. Customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. We evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. With respect to collectability, we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers' financial condition. We defer revenue if any revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\nThe common stock valuations were determined in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The assumptions we use in the valuation model are based on future expectations combined with management judgment. Our board of directors is comprised of a majority of non-employee directors who we believe have the relevant experience and expertise to determine a fair value of our common stock on each respective grant date. In the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, our board of directors, with input from management, exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the common stock's fair value as of the date of each option grant, including the following factors:\nIn March 2016, the FASB, issued ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting. This guidance affects entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. The guidance is designed to simplify several aspects of accounting for share-based payment award transactions which include: the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows, and forfeiture rate calculations. The guidance is effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n\nOperating Expenses\nSet forth below is information concerning our contractual commitments and obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nIncome tax expense decreased by $32,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to a decrease in the U.S. alternative minimum tax that was reduced by available credits. Our consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 was (61)% compared to (2)% for the year ended December 31, 2015 mainly due to a smaller loss before income tax balance. The consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016 differed from the U.S. statutory rate primarily due to the impact of changes in reserves for uncertain tax positions and in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, offset by the impact of higher state taxes and research and development credit.\nCost of revenue decreased by $7.4 million, or 18% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease was primarily related to savings from yield improvements achieved through quality assurance processes with our manufacturers and cost reductions from our supply chain achieved through negotiation on production and material costs, partially offset by the higher direct operations costs of managing a greater number of products across multiple markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we used approximately $11.5 million of cash in operating activities. The cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of increased inventories of $12.7 million to support our future product sales, our net loss of $10.0 million offset by non-cash items totaling $14.4 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $5.2 million due to increased product sales during 2015, and a decrease in deferred revenue of $2.7 million primarily from the recognition of previously deferred revenue related to a significant agreement with Intel. The cash used in operating activities was partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.4 million primarily due to higher compensation and benefit accruals resulting from increased headcount and increased professional services costs, and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of $1.3 million. Non-cash items included $12.1 million for the issuance of convertible preferred stock warrants primarily related to a collaboration and development charge, $1.9 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.2 million amortization of debt discount and non-cash interest expense, and $0.8 million of stock compensation expense, offset by a $1.6 million revaluation of our convertible preferred stock warrants.\nInternal Revenue Code Section 382 and similar California rules place a limitation on the amount of taxable income that can be offset by NOL carryforwards after a change in control (generally greater than 50% in ownership). Generally, after a control change, a corporation cannot deduct NOL carryforwards in excess of the Section 382 limitations. Due to these provisions, utilization of NOL and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations regarding their utilization against taxable income in future periods. We completed Section 382 analysis and determined ownership changes occurred in July 2005, November 2009 and August 2017, which resulted in reductions to our U.S. federal and California net operating losses of $34.9 million and $24.1 million, respectively, and U.S. federal research and development credits by $1.8 million.\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations as a percentage of revenue for each of the periods indicated:\n\nCash Flows\nRevenue\nResearch and development expenses increased $11.3 million, or 45%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $5.3 million in personnel-related costs as we continued to expand our research and development headcount, an increase of $1.1 million in design tools and prototype-related expenses and $4.8 million decrease in product development fees received from our customers in 2015, which fees offset our research and development costs.\nOther Income (Expense)\n\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Act, was signed into legislation, making the most significant changes to the U.S. tax system since 1986. The Act, among other changes, reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, implements a modified territorial tax system that includes a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of certain foreign subsidiaries, and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, our foreign subsidiaries are in a cumulative deficit. Therefore, the one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of previously untaxed accumulated earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries has minimal impact on us. Due to the Act, we have remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. We recorded a provisional decrease related to our deferred tax assets and liabilities of $15.7 million with a corresponding adjustment to our valuation allowance for the year ended December 31, 2017. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Act including (a) provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations (including related accounting policy elections) and (b) state tax implications of the Act. In addition, we are refining our calculations for certain estimated amounts above including the provisional amounts recorded for our deferred taxes and related valuation allowance. As our deferred tax asset is offset by a full valuation allowance, this change in rates had no impact on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe shipped our first products in 2009. Historically, a substantial majority of our revenue has been generated from our largest customer, Intel, including sales to contract manufacturers or ODMs at the direction of this customer in the data center server market, in particular the server portion of that market in support of our relationship with Intel. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Intel accounted for 60%, 68% and 78% and Cisco accounted for 28%, 21% and 13% of our revenue, respectively. Our 10 largest customers collectively accounted for 97%, 98% and 98% of our revenue in the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we acquire new customers and sell additional products to our existing customers. While we intend to expand our customer base over time, the markets we serve tend to be highly concentrated, and we expect that a large portion of our revenue will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future. As the markets expand, the market share of our largest customers may not increase proportionally or may decrease as competition enters into the market. This has in the past materially impacted our revenues and our market share, and it may continue to do so in the future until the diversification of our customer base lessens the impact of this significant customer concentration.\nWe have historically used cash in operating activities primarily due to our net losses, adjusted for changes in our operating assets and liabilities, particularly from accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and deferred revenue. In addition, cash in operating activities are adjusted for non-cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, issuance of convertible preferred stock warrants, the change in fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability and amortization of our debt discount.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn determining the estimated fair value of our common stock, our board of directors also considered the fact that our stockholders could not freely trade our common stock in the public markets. Accordingly, we applied discounts to reflect the lack of marketability of our common stock based on the expected time to liquidity. The estimated fair value of our common stock at each grant date reflected a non-marketability discount partially based on the anticipated likelihood and timing of a future liquidity event.\nCost of revenue increased by $10.3 million, or 30%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to $7.7 million of product costs on higher revenue and $2.5 million increase related to product mix, offset by the sales of products previously reserved.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \nWe anticipate that our revenue will fluctuate based on a variety of factors including the amount and timing of customer and end-market demand, product life cycles, average selling price which declines as our product reaches maturity, production schedule, and product mix sold during the period. In addition, we may introduce new products at lower average selling price than our existing products with the intent of increasing the market demand for our products, which may cause a fluctuation in our revenues during the period in which these new products are introduced.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we used approximately $54.0 million in investing activities, of which $48.5 million was invested in available-for-sale investments and $5.6 million for the purchases of property and equipment for general business purposes.\n\n \u2022 U.S. and global capital market conditions. \nStock-Based Compensation\n\nWe account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair value of the awards determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value of such instruments is recognized as an expense over the period in which the related services are received.\nOur common stock valuation models have historically utilized a market approach, which bases the valuation of our common stock on multiples of revenue, operating income, net income and similar metrics of publicly traded companies we believe are similar to us in terms of size, product market, liquidity, financial leverage, revenue, profitability, growth and other factors. We also examine transactions in the same or similar assets at the measurement date. These transactions can include venture investments in private firms, or stock market trading prices of similar publicly traded companies.\n</td> </tr>\nOur investing activities consist of available-for-sale investment activities, capital expenditures for property and equipment purchases and IP licenses. Our capital expenditures for property and equipment have primarily been for general business purposes, including machinery and equipment, leasehold improvements, software and computer equipment used internally, and production masks to manufacture our products.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \nWe also allocate value to each class of stock using an Option Pricing Model, or OPM, and Probability Weighted Expected Return Method, or PWERM. The OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on an enterprise value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of our convertible preferred stock. The common stock is modeled as a call option with a claim on the enterprise at an exercise price equal to the remaining value immediately after our convertible preferred stock is liquidated. The OPM is appropriate to use when the range of possible future outcomes is difficult to predict and thus creates highly speculative forecasts. PWERM involves a forward-looking analysis of the possible future outcomes of the enterprise. This method is particularly useful when discrete future outcomes can be predicted at a relatively high confidence level with a probability distribution. Discrete future outcomes considered under the PWERM include an initial public offering, or IPO, as well as non-IPO market based outcomes. Determining the fair value of the enterprise using the PWERM requires us to develop assumptions and estimates for both the probability of an IPO liquidity event and non-IPO outcomes, as well as the values we expect those outcomes could yield. We apply significant judgment in developing these assumptions and estimates, primarily based upon the enterprise value we determined using the market approach, our knowledge of the business and our reasonable expectations of discrete outcomes occurring.\nInvesting Activities\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.\nPrior to the completion of our IPO, convertible preferred stock warrants were classified as liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and remeasured to fair value at each balance sheet date with the corresponding change recorded as other income (expense). Upon the exercise of the warrants, the liability was reclassified to convertible preferred stock at their then fair value. In November 2017, upon the completion of the IPO, the warrants were converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the liability was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) at their then fair value, and will no longer be subject to fair value accounting. See Notes 1 and 5 to our audited consolidated financial statements for more information.\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $2.9 million, or 40%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases of $1.1 million for legal, consulting and audit fees, $0.8 million for personnel-related costs and $0.4 million in depreciation expense.\nAt each grant date, our board of directors reviewed any recent events and their potential impact on the estimated fair value per share of the common stock. For grants of stock awards made on dates for which there was no valuation performed by an independent valuation specialist, our board of directors determined the fair value of our common\nInventories consist of processed wafers, work-in-process and finished goods and are stated at the lower of standard cost or net realizable value. Standard costs approximate actual costs and are based on a first-in, first-out basis. We perform detailed reviews of the net realizable value of inventories, both on hand as well as for inventories that we are committed to purchase and write down the inventory value for estimated deterioration, excess and obsolete and other factors based on management's assessment of future demand and market conditions. Once written down, inventory write-downs are not reversed until the inventory is sold or scrapped. If market conditions are less favorable, we may be required to take additional inventory write-downs, which could adversely impact our gross margin and operating results.\nOur audited consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected.\nPrior to the IPO in November 2017, our board of directors determined the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock options. The board of directors granted options to be exercisable at a price per share not less than the per share fair value of our common stock underlying those options on each grant date.\n \u2022 our stage of development; \nrelated primarily to research and development. We expect to maintain this full valuation allowance until realization of the deferred tax assets becomes more likely than not.\n \u2022 Collaboration and Development Charge. Collaboration and development charge in the first quarter of 2015 represents the fair value of a fully vested convertible preferred stock warrant exercisable for 975,616 shares of Series H convertible preferred stock, which was exercised in full on May 5, 2017. This warrant was issued to GLOBALFOUNDRIES U.S. Inc., or GLOBALFOUNDRIES, at an exercise price of $0.10 per share in connection with a letter agreement to collaborate on the development of products that we plan to have manufactured by GLOBALFOUNDRIES upon qualification. As a result of the exercise of this warrant, we will not incur further such charges associated with this agreement. \nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, was enacted in April 2012. Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other public companies.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \nGross Margin\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016 we used approximately $8.4 million in investing activities for the purchase of production masks, IP licenses and other property and equipment for general business purposes.\nIn May 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Scope of Modification Accounting. It provides clarity and reduces both (1) diversity in practice and (2) cost and complexity when applying the guidance in Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, to a change to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award. The amendments provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those years and early adoption is permitted. We do not anticipate the impact of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements will be significant.\nGross profit increased by $13.3 million, or 34%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our gross margin increased by 12 percentage points. Adjusted for the $3.1 million and $1.6 million of the aforementioned deferred revenue recognized in each period which is non-recurring after June 2016, our adjusted gross margin would have been 47% and 60% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, resulting in 13 percentage points increase. The increase in gross margin was due to yield improvement and cost reductions from our supply chain.\nRevenue Recognition\n\nIncome Tax Expense\nPricing and Product Cost. Our pricing and margins depend on the volumes and the features of the ICs we provide to our customers. We believe the primary driver of gross margin is the average selling prices, or ASPs, negotiated between us and our customers relative to volume, material costs and manufacturing yield. Typically, our selling prices are contractually set for multiple quarters and our prototype selling prices are higher than our selling prices at volume production. In certain cases, we have agreed in advance to modest price reductions, generally over a period of time ranging from 18 months to five years, once the specified product begins to ship in volume. However, our customers may change their purchase orders and demand forecasts at any time with limited notice, which can sometimes lead to price renegotiations. Although these price renegotiations can sometimes result in ASPs of our products fluctuating over the shorter term, we expect ASPs generally to decline over the longer term as our products mature. These declines often coincide with improvements in manufacturing yields and lower wafer, assembly and testing costs, which offset some or all of the margin reduction that results from lower ASPs. Since we rely on third-party wafer foundries and assembly and test contractors to manufacture, assemble and test our ICs, we maintain a close relationship with our suppliers to improve quality, increase yields and lower manufacturing costs. In addition, our customers may seek to renegotiate product pricing under the contracts or purchase orders we have with them based on volume or other factors, which could drive fluctuations in ASPs.\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of interest expense on our previously outstanding debt, change in fair value of convertible preferred stock warrant liability and foreign exchange gains and losses. See Note 7 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information about our debt and the repayment of such debt.\nCost of Revenue\nIncome tax expense consists primarily of state income taxes and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct business. We have a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as the realization of the full amount of our deferred tax assets is uncertain, including net operating loss, or NOL, carryforwards, and tax credits\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRevenue\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $0.8 million, or 13%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $0.9 million in personnel-related costs.\n \u2022 the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; \nWe derive revenue from our products, which include our 10GBASE-T physical layer devices, or PHYs, custom ASICs for Intel and our recently developed AQrate product line. We currently generate revenue from the sale of our products directly to IC suppliers, original equipment manufacturers, or OEMs, and original design manufacturers, or ODMs. We market and sell our products through our direct sales force.\nOther Income (Expense)\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nResults of Operations\nCost of Revenue, Gross Profit and Gross Margin\nIncome Taxes\nIn 2017, a portion of our product sales was made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and rights of return. These pricing credits and right of return provisions prevent us from being able to reasonably estimate the final price of the product to be sold and the amount of product that could be returned pursuant to these agreements. As a result, the fixed and determinable revenue recognition criterion has not been met at the time we deliver products to our distributors. Accordingly, product revenue from sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors ship the product to their customers. The amount of deferred revenue and deferred cost related to the sales through distributors was not significant as of December 31, 2017.\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) related to the recognition and reporting of revenue that establishes a comprehensive new revenue recognition model designed to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. The guidance allows for the use of either the full or modified retrospective transition method. This new standard will be effective for us on January 1, 2018. We intend to use the modified retrospective method. Under the new standards, we do not expect an impact for revenue to our end customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors; however, we anticipate an impact on the timing for its distributor transactions. Under the new standard, we will recognize all revenue on sales to distributors upon shipment and transfer of control (known as sell-in\u201d revenue recognition), rather than deferring recognition until distributor report that they have sold the product to their customers (known as sell-through\u201d revenue recognition). This change in methodology will cause a shift in the timing of when revenue is recognized for this class of customers. We recently started providing its distributors rights that would result in a deferral of revenue under the current revenue standards. Accordingly, we anticipate deferred revenue of $0.1 million will be recorded to accumulated deficits upon adoption of this new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\n \n * Percentage change not meaningful \nCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions is measured and recognized in the financial statements at fair value. Stock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the equity award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We estimate the fair value of each equity award on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and recognize the related stock-based compensation expense on the straight-line method. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected volatility, expected term, risk-free interest rate, and expected dividends.\nItem 7.\nIncome tax expense decreased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to a research credit benefit from a foreign tax jurisdiction, offset by higher income tax related to our foreign subsidiaries and a credit not anticipated to be benefitted.\n \u2022 our operating and financial performance; \nResearch and development expenses increased $8.2 million, or 22%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase of $3.7 million in personnel-related costs as we continued to expand our research and development headcount, $2.2 million in design tools and prototype-related expenses, $1.3 million in depreciation and amortization related to lab equipment and licenses and $0.5 million in stock-based compensation.\n \u2022 the prices, rights, preferences and privileges of our preferred stock relative to the common stock; \nOther Income (Expense)\nOur revenue is subject to some seasonal variation as we begin to serve many markets and end-markets which historically experience lower sales in the first quarter of the year which may result in slower growth and lower sales as compared to other quarters.\nComponents of Results of Operations\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe estimated the fair value of stock-based awards granted using the following valuation assumptions:\nRevenue increased by $5.9 million, or 7%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase of $14.2 million, or 172%, attributable to an increase in enterprise infrastructure market revenue, offset by a decrease of $8.5 million in data center market revenue. The increase in enterprise infrastructure market revenue was primarily due to $18.4 million in higher unit sales, offset by $4.4 million attributable to lower ASPs as products sold were transitioning to volume production. The decrease in data center market revenue was primarily due to $10.4 million in lower unit sales due to fluctuating customer demand, partially offset by an increase of $3.4 million attributable to higher ASP due to product mix. In particular, the decline in data center revenue was a result of our largest customer having concentrated its purchases in 2015 in order to build up inventory in that period, and selling that accumulated inventory during 2016. In addition, data center market revenue included the recognition of deferred revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1.6 million as compared to $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as the deferred revenue was fully recognized by December 31, 2016.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we generated $43.0 million of cash from financing activities, consisting of $37.0 million of cash from the issuance of our Series H convertible preferred stock, net of issuance costs, $20.2 million from our line of credit and $1.4 million from the issuance of common stock, primarily related to the exercise of employee stock options; offset by the repayment of $15.2 million on our line of credit, $0.2 million of debt issuance costs and $0.2 million of costs related to our IPO completed in November 2017. During the year ended December 31, 2015, our outstanding balance on our line of credit ranged from $0 to $10.3 million.\n * Percentage change not meaningful \n \u2022 our history and the introduction of new products and services; \nCost of revenue consists of costs of materials, primarily wafers processed by third-party foundries, costs associated with packaging, assembly and testing paid to our third-party contract manufacturers, and personnel and other costs associated with our manufacturing operations. Our cost of revenue also includes allocation of overhead and facility costs, depreciation of production equipment, inventory write-downs and amortization of production mask costs. As we introduce new products, the cost of revenue will fluctuate depending on yield, volume and production cost of these products.\n \u2022 General and Administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel costs, professional and consulting fees, legal and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase in absolute dollars as we grow our operations and incur additional expenses associated with operating as a public company. \n\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe also carefully monitor changes in customer demand and end-market demand, including seasonality, cyclicality and the competitive landscape. Our customers share their development schedules with us, including the projected launch dates of their product offerings. Once our customers are in production, they generally will provide nine to 12-month forecasts of expected demand, which gives us an indication of future demand. However, our customers may change their purchase orders and demand forecasts at any time with limited notice. In light of our significant customer concentration, our revenue is likely to be materially and disproportionally, due in part to fluctuating end-market demand, impacted by the purchasing decisions of our largest customers.\n\n \u2022 valuations performed by an unrelated third-party specialist; \nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we first began to ship into the enterprise infrastructure market and began shipping in volume in 2015. Due to the introduction of our AQrate products, we anticipate that revenue from the enterprise infrastructure market will grow at a greater rate than revenue from the data center market over the next two years. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we started to sample our first access market products. We believe that the access market will represent a significant portion of our revenue in the near future.\nstock on the date of grant based upon the immediately preceding valuation and other pertinent information available to it at the time of grant.\n\n \u2022 Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, field application engineering support, travel costs, professional and consulting fees and allocated overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars as we increase our sales and marketing personnel and grow our international operations. \nCustomer Demand and Product Life Cycles. Once customers design our ICs into their products, we closely monitor all phases of the product life cycle, including the initial design phase, prototype production, volume production and inventories. For example, during the periods presented, we had several products progressing through their product life cycles. In the data center market, the majority of our revenue for the periods presented was derived from our 10GBASE-T custom ASIC product, which we refer to as Twinville. In late 2015, we introduced and began to record revenue from our Sageville and Coppervale products. We anticipate that our Twinville product will transition to these two newer ASIC products over time, although the timing and rate of such transition will depend on our customers' adoption of these products and the demand for our customers' products. In the enterprise infrastructure market, during the periods presented, we developed our 5GBASE-T and 2.5GBASE-T AQrate product. We first shipped our AQrate products into the enterprise infrastructure market in the fourth quarter of 2014. We began shipping AQrate products in volume in 2015 and 2016. We also started to ship our multiple lines of products into the access market in the fourth quarter of 2016. We expect the revenue from our AQrate products, and therefore the percentage of our total revenue attributable to the enterprise infrastructure and access markets, to increase from the current levels.\n\nOperating Activities\nWe are a fabless semiconductor company. We have shipped more than 10 million ports to customers across three semiconductor process generations, and are currently in mass production in 28nm process node. 28nm and other silicon process geometries, such as 40nm and 90nm, refer to the size of the process node in nanometers for a particular semiconductor manufacturing process. Our end customers include Aruba (acquired by Hewlett-Packard Enterprise in 2015), Brocade, Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard Enterprise, Huawei, Intel, Juniper, Oracle and Ruckus (acquired by Brocade in 2016). For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our revenue was $103.4 million, $86.7 million and $80.8 million, respectively, our net loss was $5.4 million, $0.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and our non-GAAP net income (loss) was $(2.7) million, $1.1 million and $1.3 million, respectively. See Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data-Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we used $9.1 million of cash in financing activities, consisting of $11.6 million used in repayments of our line of credit and borrowings and payments of $2.4 million on costs related to\nJOBS Act Transition Period\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.8 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average period of approximately 3.1 years.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAdopted\nWe account for our outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants as derivative liabilities as the terms of the warrants are not fixed due to potential adjustments in the exercise price and the number of shares upon an equity financing at a lower price. The convertible preferred stock warrants are initially recorded at fair value when issued, with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognized in other income (expense) in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss at each period end while such instruments are outstanding and classified as liabilities. Upon the exercise of the warrants, the liability was reclassified to convertible preferred stock at their then fair value. Upon the completion of the IPO, the warrants were converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock and the liability was reclassified to stockholders' equity (deficit) at their then fair value, and will no longer be subject to fair value accounting. The fair values of the convertible preferred stock warrants issued in connection with debt agreements are recorded as debt discounts and are amortized as non-cash interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations over the expected repayment period of the debt agreements. The fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrants issued in connection with a letter agreement to collaborate on the development of products in 2015 was recorded as an operating expense at the date of issuance.\nConvertible Preferred Stock Warrant Liability\n\n \u2022 any adjustment necessary to recognize a lack of marketability for our common stock; and \nInventories\nIncome Tax Expense\n \u2022 the likelihood of achieving a liquidity event for the shares of common stock underlying these stock options, such as an initial public offering or sale of the company, given prevailing market conditions at the time; \nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants relate to the weighted-average assumptions from January 1, 2017 through November 3, 2017 when our convertible preferred stock warrants were converted into common stock warrants, and for the year ended December 31, 2016 were as follows:\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe critical accounting policies requiring estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our audited consolidated financial statements are described below.\n \u2022 current business conditions and projections; \n \u2022 Research and Development. Our research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, pre-production engineering mask costs, software license and intellectual property expenses, design tools and prototype-related expenses, facility costs, supplies and depreciation expense. We expense research and development costs as incurred. In addition, we enter into development agreements with some of our customers that provide fees that partially offset development costs. Such fees are recognized upon completion of the contract deliverables or milestones, and acceptance by the customer if required. We believe that continued investment in our products and services is important for our future growth and acquisition of new customers and, as a result, we expect our research and development expenses to continue to increase on an absolute basis. \nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230), which provides guidance for eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 is effective retrospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those annual reporting periods. We early adopted this guidance in 2016, and the adoption of this guidance did not result in any adjustments.\nWe believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, our expected cash flows from product sales, and funds available for borrowing under our credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for at least the next 12 months. Over the longer term, our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our sales and marketing and research and development expenditures, and the continuing market acceptance of our solutions. In the event that we need to borrow funds or issue additional equity, we cannot assure you that any such additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, any future borrowings may result in additional restrictions on our business and any issuance of additional equity would result in dilution to investors. If we are unable to raise additional capital when we need it, it would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nSales and marketing expenses increased $1.9 million, or 35%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to an increase in personnel-related costs of $1.4 million due to higher headcount and marketing tradeshow costs of $0.3 million.\nOur success and future revenue depend on our ability to achieve design wins and to convince our current and prospective customers to design our products into their product offerings. In addition, our revenue may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors including customer demand and product life cycles, product cost and product mix sold during the period.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nGross profit increased by $6.4 million, or 12%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our gross margin decreased by 4%. The gross margin decrease was primarily due to higher product cost related to product mix, which approximated 2.6% and the impact of $1.6 million of the aforementioned deferred revenue recognized for the year ended December 31, 2016, which approximated 1.8% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nWe are a leader in the design, development and marketing of advanced high-speed communications integrated circuits, or ICs, for Ethernet connectivity in the data center, enterprise infrastructure and access markets. Our Ethernet solutions provide a critical interface between the high-speed analog signals transported over wired infrastructure and the digital information used in computing and networking equipment. Our products are designed to cost-effectively deliver leading-edge data speeds for use in the latest generation of communications infrastructure to alleviate network bandwidth bottlenecks caused by the exponential growth of global Internet Protocol, or IP, traffic. Many of our semiconductor solutions have established benchmarks in the industry in terms of performance, power consumption and density. Our innovative solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings, position themselves to gain market share and drive the ongoing equipment infrastructure upgrade cycles in the data center, enterprise infrastructure and access markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015 we used approximately $4.2 million in investing activities for the purchase of production masks and other property and equipment for general business purposes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in operating activities was approximately $11.5 million. The cash used in operating activities was primarily due to $14.1 million in net decrease from changes in operating assets and liabilities, of which $11.5 million were used to increase inventories for the anticipation of product demands in multiple markets, and net loss of $5.4 million, offset by non-cash expenses of $8.0 million.\nFollowing the IPO, the fair value of our common stock is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the NYSE on the grant date.\nSeasonality\n\nA tax position can be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date and then only in an amount more likely than not to be sustained upon review by the tax authorities. We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes.\nreasonably assured. Delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer. There are no circumstances where revenue is recognized prior to delivery. Customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. We evaluate whether the price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction. With respect to collectability, we perform credit checks for new customers and perform ongoing evaluations of our existing customers' financial condition. We defer revenue if any revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\nWe primarily sell our products direct to our customers and to our customers' manufacturing subcontractors. We offer a limited number of customer rebates and accrue an estimate of such rebates at the time revenue is recognized. Such rebates were not material in any of the periods presented, and the differences between the actual amount of such rebates and our estimates also were not material. Revenue is recognized when delivery has occurred, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, and collection of the resulting receivable is\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for the periods presented. The period-to-period comparison of results is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for future periods.\nOperating Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated $44.7 million of cash from financing activities, consisting of proceeds of $65.6 million proceeds from our IPO, $1.4 million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and preferred stock warrants, offset by net repayment of our borrowings of $19.2 million and payments of $2.9 million of costs related to the IPO.\nOther expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by $1.3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily due to lower interest expense of $1.6 million as the principal of debt was repaid in November 2017, offset by an increase in the fair value of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability, a non-cash expense.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nOperating Expenses\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the section titled Item 6. Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors\u201d and in other parts of this report. See also the section titled Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report.\nWe expect our gross margin to fluctuate on a quarterly basis as a result of changes in ASPs due to new product introductions, existing product transitions to high-volume manufacturing, product maturation and fluctuations in manufacturing costs.\nOverview\nDesign Wins with New and Existing Customers. Our existing and prospective customers tend to be multinational enterprises with large annual purchases of ICs that are continuously developing new products for existing and new application areas. Our solutions enable our customers to differentiate their product offerings and position themselves to gain market share and drive the next upgrade cycles in data center and enterprise infrastructure. We have programs in place to help our existing customers use our solutions throughout their product portfolio, and we work closely with our existing and prospective customers to understand their product roadmaps and strategies. Because of our extended sales cycle, our revenue in future years is highly dependent on design wins we are awarded today. Further, because we expect our revenue relating to our mature products to decline in the future, we consider design wins critical to our future success and anticipate being increasingly dependent on revenue from newer design wins for our newer products.\nThe key subjective factors and assumptions used in our valuations primarily consisted of: (1) the selection of the appropriate market comparable transactions, (2) the selection of the appropriate comparable publicly traded companies, (3) the financial forecasts utilized to determine future cash balances and necessary capital requirements, (4) the probability and timing of the various possible liquidity events, (5) the estimated weighted-average cost of capital and (6) the discount for lack of marketability of our common stock.\nDuring the periods presented, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCommon Stock Valuations\nCollaboration and development charge represents the fair value of a fully vested warrant to purchase 975,616 shares of Series H convertible preferred stock issued to GLOBALFOUNDRIES in 2015, which was subsequently exercised in full on May 5, 2017.\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through cash generated from product sales, proceeds from our convertible preferred stock and debt financings and our IPO in November 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments of $56.4 million.

"summary": " Here are the key points from the MD&A report:\n\n- Revenue increased 19% from 2016 to 2017, primarily due to growth in the enterprise infrastructure and access markets. Revenue increased 7% from 2015 to 2016.\n\n- Gross margin decreased 4 percentage points from 2016 to 2017 due to product mix and lower deferred revenue. Gross margin increased 12 percentage points from 2015 to 2016 due to yield improvements and cost reductions. \n\n- Operating expenses increased 22% from 2016 to 2017, primarily driven by R&D growth. Operating expenses increased 4% from 2015 to 2016.\n\n- Net loss was $5.4 million in 2017 compared to $0.4 million in 2016. Net loss was $10.0 million in 2015. \n\n- Cash used in operating activities was $11.5 million in 2017, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $12.1 million in 2016 and cash used of $11.5 million in 2015. \n\n- Cash from financing activities was $44.7 million in 2017, primarily from the IPO proceeds, compared to cash used of $9.1 million in 2016 for debt repayments. Cash from financing activities was $43.0 million in 2015, primarily from issuance of preferred stock.\n\nIn summary, the company has grown revenue but remains unprofitable, with increasing operating expenses. The IPO provided a cash infusion in 2017 but operating cash flows were negative. Continued revenue growth and path to profitability are key factors for the company's performance."}
