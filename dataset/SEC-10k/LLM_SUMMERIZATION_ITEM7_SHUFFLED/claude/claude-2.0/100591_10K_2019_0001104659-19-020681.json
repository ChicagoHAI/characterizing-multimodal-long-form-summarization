We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nBusiness Description\nArgan is a holding company that conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, GPS, APC, SMC and TRC.\nThrough GPS and APC, which together provided 76%, 91% and 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development, technical and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets. The wide range of customers includes independent power producers, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. Including consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d), GPS and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern region of the US and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as piping systems, pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Through SMC, which conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.\nAt the holding company level, we intend to make additional acquisitions of and/or investments in companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that acquired companies will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows and value for our stockholders.\nOverview\nNotable accomplishments and other events for Fiscal 2019 included the following:\n\u00b7 GPS reached substantial completion for four of its power plant projects.\n\u00b7 GPS entered into three EPC services contracts to construct state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plants, having an aggregate power output of approximately 4.0 gigawatts.\n\u00b7 Both APC and TRC achieved record amounts of revenues during Fiscal 2019.\n\u00b7 We maintained overall profitability levels as consolidated gross profit and net income attributable to our stockholders, expressed as percentages of consolidated revenues, were 17.1% and 10.8%, respectively.\n\u00b7 After a lengthy and extensive study, we recorded income tax credit benefits associated with increasing research and development activities in our financial results for Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $16.6 million.\n\u00b7 We declared and paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.25, for a total of $1.00 during Fiscal 2019.\n\u00b7 The adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard resulted in an immaterial change to our retained earnings and minimal changes to our ongoing revenue recognition.\nAs construction activity on four large natural gas-fired power plants wound down during the current year, our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019 declined to $482.2 million from $892.8 million for Fiscal 2018 when the construction activity on all of these projects were at peak or near-peak levels. However, we are encouraged by the growth in the revenues of our other operating units (TRC, APC and SMC) which more than doubled in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018. Our gross profit for Fiscal 2019 was $82.4 million compared with $149.3 million for Fiscal 2018, reflecting primarily the reduction in consolidated revenues between periods. However, our gross margin percentage increased to 17.1% for Fiscal 2019 from 16.7% for the prior year.\nWe reported in previous filings that we expected the revenues of GPS to decrease significantly in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018, which they did. We anticipate adding new EPC services contracts to our growing project backlog and beginning work on the new projects in the first half of the year ending January 31, 2020 (\u201cFiscal 2020\u201d) as discussed below. However, it takes time for us to ramp-up meaningful revenues associated with new EPC projects due to the timing of when we receive full notices to proceed with all construction efforts and the overall project life-cycles of gas-fired power plants. Therefore, we expect to continue to report reduced consolidated revenues for the first half of Fiscal 2020 as we begin preliminary design and site preparation activities and prepare for the early stages of expected new projects. We are optimistic that we will see a resumption of year-to-year growth for the entire Company as new EPC service projects of GPS mature. Additional new EPC service project opportunities exist and, as reported in previous filings, negotiations continue with project owners for several new projects. Project backlog was approximately $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2019 compared with $0.4 billion as of January 31, 2018.\nGPS and APC are completing certain projects that are confronting significant operational and contractual challenges, and our operating results for Fiscal 2019 reflect unfavorable gross profit adjustments on these jobs which are both behind the schedules originally established for these jobs. These projects may continue to impact our operating results negatively until they reach completion.\nThe favorable effects of research and development credits and the reduction in the corporate income tax rate in the US, which partially offset the 44.8% decrease in the amount of gross profit, were the primary reasons that we experienced a limited decrease of 27.7% in net income attributable to our stockholders for Fiscal 2019 to $52.0 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, from $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, in the prior year.\nExecution on Project Backlog\nThe following table presents our major power plant projects as of January 31, 2019:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> FNTP (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Scheduled\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Location\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Size\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Received\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Completion\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exelon West Medway II Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Massachusetts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 200 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> April 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> TeesREP Biomass Power Station\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Teesside (England)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 299 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> May 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> InterGen Spalding OCGT Expansion Project\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Spalding (England)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 298 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> November 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NTE Reidsville Energy Center\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> North Carolina\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Guernsey Power Station\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Ohio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,875 MW\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Full Notice-to-Proceed (\u201cFNTP\u201d) represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence all of the activities covered by the corresponding contract.\n(2) Project activities were discontinued on March 7, 2019. At that time, the EPC project was nearly complete and first fire had been achieved on both of the power production units included in this gas-fired power plant (see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, included in Part I of this report for further information regarding this matter).\n(3) A FNTP has not been received and the scheduled completion date has not been established definitively as of January 31, 2019.\n(4) A limited notice to proceed with certain preliminary design and site preparation activities was issued to GPS in January 2019. We expect to receive FNTP in the spring of 2019.\nThe reported amount of our project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded to us that we consider to be firm as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding contracts. Cancellations or reductions may occur that may reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. Typically, we include the total value of an EPC service contract in project backlog when we receive a corresponding notice to proceed from the project owner. However, we may include the value of an EPC services contract prior to the receipt of a notice to proceed if we believe that it is probable that the project will commence within a reasonable timeframe, among other factors.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, GPS entered into three EPC services contracts to construct state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plants, having an aggregate power output of approximately 4.0 gigawatts. In addition to the Reidsville Energy Center and the Guernsey Power Station, which are included in the table presented above and reflected in our project backlog as of January 31, 2019, GPS has entered into an EPC services contract to construct the Chickahominy Power Station, a 1,600 MW natural gas-fired power plant, in Charles City County, Virginia. Even though we are providing financial and technical support to the project development effort through a consolidated VIE, we have not included the value of this contract in our project backlog.\nIn addition, GPS has been selected by project owners to provide EPC services in connection with the construction of several other power plant projects with projected start dates in Fiscal 2020. However, GPS has not completed contract negotiations nor received a full notice to proceed on any of these EPC projects, and there is always a possibility that one or more of these projects will not be built.\nOver the last few years, our ability to run our business in a manner that provides consistent financial results has been unfavorably impacted by the lengthening time between the conception of a power plant project and the commencement of construction activities. We believe that the resulting delays in new business awards to GPS relates, in part, to the soft demand for electricity, especially in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the US. In addition, as explained below, there is uncertainty surrounding the level of regulatory support for coal as part of the energy mix, an increase in the amount of power generating capacity provided by renewable energy assets and increasing interest in renewable energy storage solutions. Together with the difficulties experienced by project developers in obtaining project financing, these factors may be impacting the planning and initiation phases for the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants which continue to be deferred by project owners.\nIn August 2018, the administration of President Trump moved to formally replace the Clean Power Plan, an environmental regulation intended by the prior administration to be the single-most important step America has ever taken to fight climate change. The new proposal, called the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, would be more favorable to the coal industry by allowing individual states greater authority to make their own plans for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. However, even without the regulation, the US has seen a decline in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants as the supply of inexpensive natural gas and the growth in renewable energy have moved more energy providers away from coal. In addition, the coal-fired power plant fleet is generally old. It is expensive to keep the coal plants running, and they are not competitive in the market. Nevertheless, in some cases, the new plan may encourage the continued operation of old coal plants that might otherwise be retired without any government intervention.\nOther unfavorable factors include challenging energy capacity auctions for new power generating assets, the impacts of environmental activism and California's resolve to move towards 100% renewable energy. The growth of vocal support for 100% renewable energy and the support of numerous environmental groups provided motivation for the release of the Green New Deal Resolution by progressive members of the US Congress. The fostered increase in the number of protests against a variety of fossil-fuel related energy projects continue to garner media attention and public skepticism about new fossil-fuel energy projects, particularly oil and natural gas pipelines, resulting in project delays due to onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Pipeline approval delays may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to potentially new gas-fired power plant sites, thereby increasing the risk of power plant project delays or cancellations.\nResearch and Development Credits\nDuring Fiscal 2019, we completed a detailed review of the activities performed by our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits that may be available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, we identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that have not previously been recognized in our financial results for any prior year reporting period.\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. We consider Fiscal 2019 as the initial reporting period in which we had sufficient data on which to make an evaluation and reach a conclusion on the amount of income tax credit benefits related to prior year project costs that, more likely than not, qualified as research and development costs under the rules and regulations of the IRS and certain states.\nAccordingly, the income tax benefits associated with research and development activities conducted in prior years in the total amount of $16.6 million have been recognized in income taxes for Fiscal 2019. The favorable effect of this amount on diluted earnings per share was $1.06 for the year.\nGoodwill Impairment\nAs required by current accounting requirements, we performed a goodwill impairment assessment for TRC as of November 1, 2018, using the assistance of a professional business valuation firm. Although it was determined that the fair value of TRC was approximately the same value as determined as of November 1, 2017, the current year amount was less than the corresponding carrying value and we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million that is included in the consolidated statement of earnings for Fiscal 2019. Last year, a smaller goodwill impairment loss in the amount of $0.6 million was recorded. The remaining balance of goodwill for TRC that is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019, after reduction for impairment losses, was $12.3 million.\nMarket Outlook\nThe total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the US in 2018 was the highest amount generated since 2007. In its latest base-case outlook, the US Energy Information Administration (the \u201cEIA\u201d) forecasts steady growth in net electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of approximately 1.0% per year. The growth rate is tempered by new electricity-efficient devices and production processes replacing older, less-efficient appliances, heating, cooling and ventilation systems and capital equipment. Nonetheless, the EIA forecasts continued growth for natural gas-fired electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of 1.2% per year. EIA expects the share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas-fired power plants in the US to rise from approximately 34% in 2018 to 37% in 2022 and to 39% by 2050. On the other hand, the generation share from coal is forecast to fall steadily during these periods, from 28% in 2018 to 23% in 2022 to 17% by 2050.\nAs reported by EIA for 2018, net electricity generation at utility-scale facilities in the US rose by 3.6% from the prior year level as net generation from natural gas, wind and solar sources increased by 13.2%, 8.1% and 25.0%, respectively. Moreover, the share of net electricity generation fueled by natural gas rose from approximately 31.7% in 2017 to 34.4% for 2018. The net electricity generation from coal declined by 4.9% for the year. In summary, the share of the electrical power generation mix fueled by natural gas has continued its increase in the current year, while the share fueled by coal has continued its fall.\nOver the next three years, EIA forecasts that 72 gigawatts of new wind and photovoltaic solar capacity will be added in the US attributable to declining equipment costs and the availability of valuable tax credits. As these credits decline and then expire early in the next decade, the wind capacity additions will slow. Although tax incentives related to solar power also expire, the continuing decline in the cost of solar power equipment is predicted to sustain the growth of photovoltaic solar power generation facilities. However, persistent low natural gas prices, lower power plant operating costs and higher energy generating efficiencies should sustain the demand for modern combined cycle gas-fired power plants in the future. As a result, the long-term trends in electricity generation through 2050 are dominated by natural gas-fired and solar capacity additions.\nEIA forecasts that coal-fired generating capacity will decrease by 101 gigawatts, or 42% of existing coal-fired capacity, by 2050, with most of the capacity reductions occurring by 2025. In addition, another 22 gigawatts of nuclear, or 22% of current nuclear power capacity, is expected to be retired by 2050. The retirements of coal and nuclear plants typically result in the need for new capacity. New natural gas-fired plants, which have experienced a significant increase in their ability to generate power efficiently, are relatively cheaper to build than coal, nuclear, or renewable plants, they are substantially more environmentally friendly than conventional coal-fired power plants and they represent the most economical way to meet base loads and peak demands and to maintain grid reliability. As natural gas is relatively clean burning, cost-effective and reliable, its benefits as a source of power generation are compelling. As the use of coal declines, the use of nuclear energy stalls, and the integration of increasing amounts of wind and solar power into energy grids continues (including renewable energy storage solutions), power providers should continue to value gas-fired electricity generation, including when needed to support intermittent renewable energy supplies. As indicated above, the share of the mix represented by wind farms\nand solar fields is predicted to grow with accelerated pace in the near term boosted by extended tax credits. Nonetheless, as the demand for electrical power grows, natural gas is predicted to be a strong choice for new electricity generation plants in the future primarily due to favorable economics and the scheduled expiration of renewable energy tax credits.\nAs a result, we continue to believe that the future prospects for natural gas-fired power plant construction are favorable as natural gas has become the primary source for power generation in our country. Major advances in horizontal drilling and the practice of hydraulic fracturing have led to the boom in natural gas supply which is available at consistently low prices now and in the foreseeable future. The abundant availability of cheap, less carbon-intense and higher efficiency natural gas should continue to be a significant factor in the economic assessment of future power generation capacity additions. As indicated above, the demand for electric power in this country is expected to grow slowly but steadily over the long term. Demands for electricity, the ample supply of natural gas, and the future retirement of coal, nuclear and inefficient gas-fired energy plants, should result in modern natural gas-fired energy plants representing a substantial portion of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix. Moreover, the competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plant construction has changed significantly this year. Several significant competitors have announced that they are exiting the market for a variety of reasons. While the competitive market remains dynamic, we expect that there will be fewer competitors for new gas-fired power plant EPC project opportunities.\nIn summary, the development of natural gas-fired power generation facilities in the US should continue to provide new construction opportunities for us, although the pace of new opportunities emerging may be restrained in the near term as discussed above. We are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects and the future growth of our revenues. This may result in our decision to make investments in the development and/or ownership of new projects. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider certain opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks in order to assure the award of the related EPC services contract to us. We believe that the Company has a growing reputation as an accomplished and cost-effective provider of EPC and other large project construction contracting services in the US, the UK and Ireland. With the proven ability to deliver completed power facilities, particularly combined cycle, natural gas-fired power plants, we are focused on expanding our position in the power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of electricity demand covering decades into the future. We believe that our expectations are valid and that our plans for the future continue to be based on reasonable assumptions.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2019 and 2018\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $52.0 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2019. For the prior year, we reported a comparable net income amount of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 12: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 367,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 814,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (446,732\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (54.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,668\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (300\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (2.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 482,153\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 892,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (410,662\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (46.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> COST OF REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 297,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (377,431\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (55.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,814\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (158\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 399,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 743,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (343,775\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (46.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 82,438\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66,887\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (44.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,054\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (66,740\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (62.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (65,407\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (58.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40,279\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 44,930\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,477\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (28.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net (loss) income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (167\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (502\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> N/M\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ARGAN, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (19,975\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (27.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nN/M - Not meaningful.\nRevenues\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of the power industry services business decreased by $446.7 million to $367.8 million for Fiscal 2019 compared with revenues of $814.5 million for the prior year, representing a decrease of 55% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 76% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, and approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for the prior year. The decrease in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the commissioning, start-up and final activities of four EPC projects, which represented $175.5 million, or 36%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019. All four of these projects reached substantial completion during Fiscal 2019.\nLast year, the combined revenues associated with the four gas-fired power plant projects, which were in peak and post-peak construction activity stages, represented approximately 84% of consolidated revenues for the year. Three other power plant projects reached peak construction activities during Fiscal 2019 including two projects located in the UK which are scheduled for completion in Fiscal 2020. They represented 33% of consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2019 compared to 5% of consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2018.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment (representing the business of TRC) increased by 56%, or $36.4 million, to $101.7 million for Fiscal 2019 compared with revenues of $65.3 million for the prior year as business development efforts have succeeded in winning increased amounts of business from recurring as well as new customers. The largest portion of TRC's revenues continue to be provided by industrial field services and TRC's major customers include some of North America's largest forest products companies and fertilizer producers as well as energy and mining companies with plants located in the southeast region of the US.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) were $12.7 million for Fiscal 2019, compared with revenues of $13.0 million for the prior year as it nears completion of a large, multi-year, fiber-to-the-premises project for a municipal customer located in the state of Maryland.\nCost of Revenues\nDue primarily to the substantial decrease in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, compared with consolidated revenues for the prior year, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also decreased. These costs were $399.7 million and $743.5 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $82.4 million and $149.3 million, respectively.\nHowever, the Company's overall gross profit percentage of 17.1% of consolidated revenues was higher for Fiscal 2019 compared to a percentage of 16.7% for Fiscal 2018, which was due to an improvement in the gross profit percentage of the power industry services segment. As indicated above, the results for the year were primarily driven by execution on the commissioning, start-up and final phases of four natural gas-fired power plant projects, all of which have reached substantial completion. These achievements resulted in our making favorable project close-out adjustments to the gross profits of certain large projects. Unfavorable gross profit adjustments on certain smaller projects active at year-end partially offset the impacts of the favorable project closeouts. These projects have experienced cost increases due to a number of factors, including the identification of certain areas where estimated cost assumptions were too optimistic and the encounter of unforeseen construction, labor, weather, subcontractor, contractual and owner challenges as well as other performance difficulties that may continue to impact our operating results until the projects reach completion.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we experienced labor and subcontractor costs that increased on certain now-completed projects to amounts greater than originally estimated. The corresponding increase in forecasted costs to complete these contracts and the associated reductions in the amount of forecasted gross margins resulted in reductions to the amount of consolidated gross profit reported last year.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThese costs were $40.7 million and $41.8 million for Fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a 3% decrease between the years. Stock compensation expense decreased by approximately $3.0 million between the years, primarily due to increased vesting periods associated with new stock option awards and incentive compensation decreased by $2.7 million, reflecting the reduced operations at GPS. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased non-chargeable staff costs and professional services costs.\nImpairment Losses\nImpairment losses were recorded during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 related to the goodwill of TRC in the amounts of $1.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The business valuations, which were performed for each year based on a blend of results determined by several income and market approaches, indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value at each testing date. Drivers for the impairment loss recorded in Fiscal 2019 included the increased carrying value of the business (reflecting the improved operating results for the current year), increased working capital requirements, reduced profit margins and appropriate changes to certain statistical factors. For Fiscal 2018, the impairment loss related primarily to the use of forecasted financial results which presented a less favorable outlook for TRC at that time than in prior years reflecting a trend of actual revenues below previous expectations and operating losses incurred during the year.\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nAs discussed above, we recorded an income tax benefit for Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $4.7 million which reflected the amount of the benefit associated with research and development credits generated during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018 in the amount of $16.6 million that we recorded during the current year.\nThe Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changed tax law in the US by, among other changes, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% (effective January 1, 2018). As expected, our annual effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2019, before the benefits of the research and development credits discussed above and a favorable net operating loss carryforward adjustment, decreased meaningfully to 29.5% from the comparable effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 of 35.8%, primarily due to the lower statutory tax rate. However, certain modifications of the Tax Act negatively impacted our effective rate, including the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction, the expansion of the limitation on the deductibility of certain meals and entertainment expenses and additional limits on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. The effective tax rate of 29.5% is higher than the new federal income tax rate of 21% due primarily to the unfavorable effect of state income taxes.\nFor Fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $40.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 35.8% as stated above. The annual income tax rate was higher than the blended federal income tax rate of 33.8% for Fiscal 2018 due primarily to the $5.0 million unfavorable effect of state income taxes, offset partially by the favorable $3.2 million effect of the domestic production activities deduction and by the excess income tax benefit associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2018 with a favorable effect of $0.9 million. In addition, as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, we revalued deferred taxes as of December 22, 2017 and recognized an income tax benefit of $0.8 million in Fiscal 2018.\nOther Income\nIn July 2018 and as discussed in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, TRC and PPS Engineers, Inc. (\u201cPPS\u201d) agreed to a settlement of all claims made against each other with TRC agreeing to make a payment to PPS in the amount of $0.9 million. As the total of previously accrued amounts exceeded the negotiated settlement amount, we recorded a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1.4 million that is included in other income for Fiscal 2019.\nFor Fiscal 2019 and 2018, this line item also includes interest income in the amounts of $4.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, earned on certificate of deposit investments purchased from our bank (\u201cCDs\u201d) and $1.8 million and $0.7 million of additional investment income earned on funds maintained in a money market fund, respectively. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the weighted average annual interest rates of the CDs owned during the corresponding years were 2.0% and 1.3%, respectively, and the weighted average income rates related to the money market investments were 1.9% and 0.8%, respectively. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the weighted average initial terms-to-maturity of the CDs were 250 days and 219 days, respectively.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2018. For Fiscal 2017, we reported a comparable net income amount of $70.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (dollars in thousands).\nTable 13: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended January 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 814,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 586,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,303\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78,994\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (17.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,425\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,543\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 892,815\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 217,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> COST OF REVENUES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Power industry services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 675,362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 452,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 222,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Industrial fabrication and field services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68,354\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,071\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (14.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Telecommunications infrastructure services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,845\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 743,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 528,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 146,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,614\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 32,478\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (70.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 106,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,277\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (4.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 114,532\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,907\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37,106\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,426\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5,080\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (6,763\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (95.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS OF ARGAN, INC.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 72,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,328\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of the power industry services business increased by $227.9 million to $814.5 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $586.6 million for Fiscal 2017, representing an increase of 39% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, and approximately 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017. The increase in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of the four large natural gas-fired power plant construction projects, which represented $747.5 million, or 84%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2017, the combined revenues associated with these four projects, which were all in their earlier phases, represented $465.8 million, or 69%, of consolidated revenues. Construction activity related to two other natural-gas fired power plant projects that were completed in Fiscal 2017 represented 14% of consolidated revenues for that year. In addition, revenue for APC increased substantially during Fiscal 2018, primarily due to revenues of $12.2 million associated with the initial construction activity for two power plant projects in the UK.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment decreased by 17%, or $13.7 million, to $65.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $79.0 million for Fiscal 2017. The largest portion of TRC's revenues were provided by industrial field services. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to revenues included in Fiscal 2017 associated with large loss projects with former customers that were in-process on the date of our acquisition of TRC and which were primarily completed during that year.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) increased by $3.5 million, or 38%, to $13.0 million during Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $9.4 million for Fiscal 2017, as SMC was successful in increasing the revenues related to both outside and inside premises projects.\nCost of Revenues\nDue primarily to the substantial increase in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, compared with consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased. These costs were $743.5 million and $528.3 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $149.3 million and $146.7 million, respectively. Our overall gross profit percentages of revenues were 16.7% and 21.7% for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The decline in the percentage between years reflected the favorable achievement of contractual final completion of two natural gas-fired power plant projects during Fiscal 2017 which eliminated a number of significant risks and the related estimated costs associated with them, resulting in increased gross margins.\nThe gross profit percentage for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected execution on the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of four natural gas-fired power plant projects of GPS. However, during Fiscal 2018, certain of the natural gas-fired power plant projects had experienced meaningful increased labor and subcontractor costs to amounts greater than originally estimated. The increases in forecasted costs to complete these contracts and the corresponding reductions in the amounts of forecasted gross margins resulted in a reduction to consolidated gross profit being recognized during the latter half of Fiscal 2018. The gross profit percentage increased at APC and SMC and decreased at TRC, resulting in a net aggregate gross profit percent decrease of 1.0% of the combined revenues of the non-GPS entities between the years.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nThese costs were $41.8 million and $32.5 million for Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing approximately 4.7% and 4.8% of consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively. Approximately $5.6 million of the increase between the years was due to an overall increase in salaries and incentive compensation costs driven by increased operations and project work, primarily at GPS and APC. In addition, stock option compensation expense increased by approximately $2.3 million between the years, primarily due to increased market prices of our common stock at the date that the majority of the corresponding stock options were granted. The remaining $1.4 million increase from Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2018 related to increased contributions to employee retirement plans, employee separation costs and other expenses partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.\nImpairment Losses\nAs indicated above, the revenues of TRC declined for Fiscal 2018 and it reported operating losses during Fiscal 2018. With the decreased results in Fiscal 2018 and a less favorable outlook for TRC, our business valuation performed at that time indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value. As a result, TRC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2018 of approximately $0.6 million.\nIn Fiscal 2017, the revenues of APC declined and it reported operating losses. In July 2016, work was suspended on APC's largest project at the time, which represented over 90% of APC's project backlog. Additionally, the pound sterling drop, financial market uncertainty and recessionary pressures related to Brexit were thought to likely impact the availability of financing for future power plant developments. Given these circumstances, analyses were performed mid-year in order to determine whether an impairment loss related to goodwill had been incurred. Using income and market approaches, the assessment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value at that time. As a result, APC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2017 of approximately $2.0 million.\nIncome Tax Expense\nFor Fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $40.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 35.8%. The annual income tax rate was higher than our blended federal income tax rate of 33.8% for Fiscal 2018 due primarily to the $5.0 million unfavorable effect of state income taxes, offset partially by the favorable $3.2 million effect of the domestic production activities deduction and by the excess income tax benefit associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2018 with a favorable effect of $0.9 million. The latter benefit declined significantly between years as the volume of stock option exercises decreased in Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2017, we also obtained substantial benefit from the exclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interests in joint ventures which were consolidated for financial reporting purposes (see the next paragraph); for Fiscal 2018, the income tax benefit of the exclusion was only $0.1 million due to the substantial wind-up of activities by the joint ventures at that time. In addition, as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company revalued its deferred taxes as of December 22, 2017 and recognized an income tax benefit of $0.8 million for Fiscal 2018.\nFor Fiscal 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $37.1 million resulting in an annual effective income tax rate of 32.4%. This annual rate differed from the expected federal income tax rate of 35.0% due to the favorable effect of the amounts of permanent differences for the year offset partially by the effect of state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, in the amount of $4.0 million. Most significantly, favorable permanent differences related to 1) the treatment of the excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2017, 2) the domestic production activities deduction and 3) the exclusion from taxable income of the income attributable to non-controlling interests which reduced income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 by $5.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nOther Income\nFor Fiscal 2018 and 2017, this line item included interest income in the amounts of $5.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, earned on CDs and $0.7 million and $0.2 million of additional investment income earned on funds maintained in a money market account, respectively. For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, the weighted average annual interest rates of the CDs owned during the corresponding years were 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively, and the weighted average income rates related to the money market investments were 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, the weighted average initial terms-to-maturity of the CDs were 219 days and 166 days, respectively.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we entered separate construction joint ventures related to two natural gas-fired power plant projects. Because we had financial control at that time, the joint ventures were included in our consolidated financial statements. Our joint venture partner's share of the earnings is reflected in the line item captioned net income attributable to non-controlling interests included in the accompanying statements of earnings for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 in the amounts of $0.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The reduction in the amount between years primarily reflected the contractual completion of the projects in Fiscal 2017, with the provision of warranty services being the primary remaining obligations of the joint ventures in Fiscal 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of January 31, 2019 and 2018\nAt January 31, 2019 and 2018, our balances of cash and cash equivalents were $164.3 million and $122.1 million, respectively. During this same period, our working capital increased by $32.3 million to $334.1 million as of January 31, 2019 from $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018.\nThe net amount of cash used in operating activities during Fiscal 2019 was $112.3 million. Even though net income for the period, including the favorable adjustments related to non-cash income and expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $57.0 million, cash used in operations exceeded this amount. As discussed above, four major EPC projects achieved substantial completion in the current year, representing the primary driver for the use of cash by contracts-in-progress during the current year in the amount of $83.8 million. These projects were well past the peak of their respective milestone billing schedules. Due primarily to these projects, the amounts of billings in excess of the amounts of the corresponding costs and estimated earnings declined by $99.7 million during Fiscal 2019, which represented a substantial use of cash. Partially offsetting this effect, the Company collected amounts of billings previously retained by project owners which provided $48.7 million in cash during the period.\nAs presented above, the operations of TRC and APC have experienced meaningful growth in revenues this year. As expected, the increase in the level of business resulted in an increase in the amount of working capital required to support the growth. Accordingly, the amounts of costs incurred and estimated earnings recognized on certain active projects in excess of the amounts billed on those projects rose during Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $33.8 million, which represents a use of cash. Similarly, due in part to increased activity at these operating subsidiaries, accounts receivable increased during Fiscal 2019, a use of cash in the amount of $10.2 million. The Company also used cash in the amount of $60.2 million to reduce the level of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Due primarily to the inclusion of expected income tax refunds, the balance of other assets increased by $15.2 million during Fiscal 2019, representing a use of cash.\nThe primary source of cash required to fund operations during Fiscal 2019 was the net maturity of short-term investments (CDs purchased from our Bank) in the amount of $179.0 million. Non-operating activities used cash during the current year, including primarily the payment of four quarterly cash dividends in the total amount of $15.6 million. Our operating subsidiaries also used cash during Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $8.6 million to fund capital expenditures. As of January 31, 2019, there were no restrictions with respect to inter-company payments from GPS, TRC, APC or SMC to the holding company.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, our combined balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased by $45.1 million to $122.1 million as of January 31, 2018 from a balance of $167.2 million as of January 31, 2017. During this same year, our working capital increased by $64.6 million to $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018 from $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017.\nEven though net income for the period, including the favorable adjustments related to non-cash expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $80.1 million, cash used in operations exceeded this amount primarily due to the effects of the four major EPC projects active during the year. Because these projects were well past the peak of their respective milestone billing schedules, we experienced a net decrease during Fiscal 2018 in the amount of billings on current projects in excess of corresponding costs and estimated earnings, which represented a use of cash in the amount of $102.5 million. The increase in project owner retainage amounts on active construction contracts represented a use of cash in the amount of $33.9 million. Other uses of cash included increased other assets of $4.6 million, primarily reflecting increased income tax payments, and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $6.2 million, primarily reflecting the run-off of our warranty obligations related to power plants completed in prior years.\nOur primary source of this cash during Fiscal 2018 was the net maturity of short-term investments in the amount of $45.0 million. In addition, the exercise of options to purchase 109,500 shares of our common stock provided us with cash proceeds in the approximate amount of $3.2 million. Non-operating activity cash uses included primarily the payment of a cash dividend of $15.5 million. During Fiscal 2018, we also used cash as our consolidated joint ventures made distributions to our joint venture partner in the total amount of $1.2 million. Our operating subsidiaries used cash during Fiscal 2018 in the amount of $4.8 million for capital expenditures and GPS funded $1.5 million in development loans to various power facility project development entities.\nOn May 15, 2017, we entered into the Credit Agreement with the Bank as lender which replaced a predecessor agreement and modified its features to, among other things:\n\u00b7 increase the Bank's lending commitment amount from $10.0 million to $50.0 million including a revolving loan with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.0%;\n\u00b7 add an accordion feature which allows for an additional commitment amount of $10.0 million, subject to certain conditions; and\n\u00b7 extend the maturity date three years from May 31, 2018 to May 31, 2021.\nWe have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Bank's consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank will continue to require that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each fiscal quarter-end. The Credit Agreement includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature. At January 31, 2019 and 2018, we were compliant with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We may use the borrowing ability to cover other credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business.\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had approximately $15.2 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, primarily to support our APC activities. However, we had no outstanding borrowings. In addition, the commercial bank that has supported the activities of TRC issued an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit on its behalf in the amount of $0.4 million.\nAt January 31, 2019, most of our balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in a high-quality money market fund with at least 99.5% of its total assets invested in cash, U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements secured by US Treasury obligations. Most of our domestic operating bank accounts are maintained with the Bank. We do maintain certain Euro-based bank accounts in the Republic of Ireland, certain pound sterling-based bank accounts in the UK and insignificant bank accounts in other countries in support of the operations of APC.\nWe believe that cash on hand, cash that will be provided from the maturities of short-term investments and cash generated from our future operations, with or without funds available under our line of credit, will be adequate to meet our general business needs in the foreseeable future. In particular, we maintain significant liquid capital on our balance sheet to help ensure our ability to maintain and obtain bonding capacity for current and future EPC and other construction projects. Any future acquisitions, or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement, may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nContractual Obligations\nContractual obligations outstanding as of January 31, 2019 are summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Over 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Amounts represent primarily service arrangements.

We have no significant obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete contracts awarded to us.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in the engineering, procurement and construction contracts. For certain projects, we are required by project owners to provide guarantees related to our services or work. If our services under a guaranteed project would not be completed or would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable, we would record such guaranteed losses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation. We have a line of credit committed by the Bank in the amount of $50.0 million for general purposes. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover standby letters of credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately $15.2 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but no borrowings.\nFrom time to time, we may arrange for bonding to be issued by our surety firm for the benefit of the owner of an energy project for which we are not providing construction services. We collect fees from the provider of such services as consideration for the use of our bonding capacity. As of January 31, 2019, the total amount of outstanding surety bonds issued under such arrangements was $11.1 million.\nAs is common in our industry, EPC contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of executing a project or program for a project owner. These teaming arrangements are generally dissolved upon completion of the project or program. In addition, as discussed previously, we may obtain interests in VIEs formed by its owners for a specific purpose.\nWe consider ourselves to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE formed last year by an independent firm for the purpose of developing a natural gas-fired power plant. Pursuant to agreements negotiated with the developer, we are lending funds to the VIE to cover certain costs of the project development effort. The development phase activities of the VIE are focused on 1) obtaining the necessary permits to build and operate the power plant, 2) completing arrangements to connect the power plant to the fuel supply and the electricity grid, 3) engaging energy plant operators in negotiations for the purchase of project ownership interests, and 4) securing permanent financing for the project, with financial closing expected to occur during calendar year 2019. As we are the primary beneficiary of this VIE during the development phase, it is included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019.\nWe have entered into similar support arrangements with other independent parties in the past that resulted in the successful development and construction of three separate gas-fired power plants. In each case, we deconsolidated the corresponding VIE when we were no longer the primary beneficiary.\nWe may enter into other support arrangements in the future in connection with power plant development opportunities when they arise and when we are confident that providing early financial support for the projects will lead to the award of the corresponding EPC contracts to us.\nWe had financial control of construction joint ventures formed for the purpose of building two power plants, which were completed in Fiscal 2017 and for which the respective warranty periods have expired. The statutory partnerships representing the joint venture entities were dissolved during the year ended January 31, 2019. The accounts of the joint ventures were included in our consolidated financial statements during the periods of their existence.\nInflation\nOur monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivables, and our non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property, plant, equipment goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, are not affected significantly by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of our building, improvements, equipment and furniture will not materially affect our operations.\nWe do procure steel and other commodities for use in our construction projects. These materials can be subject to significant price fluctuations. For example, raw steel prices increased sharply at the beginning of calendar 2018, driven by a bullish market in commodities and industrial metals, as well as by import tariffs imposed by the US. During most of 2018, domestic steel prices remained at seven-year highs. However, steel prices have showed slower momentum recently and current domestic steel prices appear in a downtrend. On the other hand, the well-publicized shortage of skilled construction workers has been accompanied recently by corresponding wage increases at rates higher than those experienced since the recession in 2007. We strive to include the anticipated increases in the prices of equipment and commodity materials and the expected rise in labor rates as we estimate costs and prepare prices associated with bidding for new work. Although we have not been adversely affected by price fluctuations and wage increases to any significant extent in the past, there is no assurance that we will not be in the future.\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d)\nThe following table presents the determinations of EBITDA for Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively (amounts in

presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure, the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions. Further, we believe that EBITDA is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance.\nHowever, as EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with US GAAP, we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the results of our operations presented in accordance with US GAAP that are included in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our EBITDA does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDescriptions of the Company's significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, are included in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019. We consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long-term construction contracts; income tax reporting; the accounting for business combinations; the subsequent valuation of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the valuation of employee stock options; and the financial reporting associated with any significant claims or legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, as well as the accounting and reporting for special purpose entities including joint ventures and variable interest entities. Critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in arriving at estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions.\nThese estimates, judgments, and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets, liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d and a series of amendments which together we identify as \u201cASC Topic 606\u201d. This new accounting standard, which we adopted on February 1, 2018 using the permitted modified retrospective method, outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. The new standard supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The effect of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on retained earnings as of February 1, 2018 was not material. The differences between our reported operating results for the year ended January 31, 2019, which reflect the application of the new standard on our contracts, and the results that would have been reported if the accounting was performed pursuant to the accounting standards previously in effect, also were not material.\nWe enter into EPC and other long-term construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids or in conjunction with our support of the development of power plant projects. The types of contracts may vary. However, the EPC contracts of our power industry services reporting segment, and most other large contracts awarded to our other companies, are fixed-price contracts. Revenues are recognized primarily over time as performance obligations are satisfied due to the continuous transfer of control to the project owner or other customer.\nCentral to the new revenue recognition guidance is a five-step revenue recognition model that requires reporting entities to:\n1. Identify the contract,\n2. Identify the performance obligations of the contract,\n3. Determine the transaction price of the contract,\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and\n5. Recognize revenue.\nThe new guidance focuses on the transfer of the contractor's control of the goods and/or services to the customer, as opposed to the transfer of risk and rewards. Major provisions cover the determination of which goods and services are distinct and represent separate performance obligations, the appropriate treatment of variable consideration, and the evaluation of whether revenues should be recognized at a point in time or over time. Application of the new rules requires us to make important judgements and meaningful estimates that may have significant impact on the amounts of revenues recognized by us for a reporting period.\nRevenues from fixed price contracts, including a portion of estimated profit, are recognized over time, based on costs incurred and estimated total contract costs using the percentage-of-completion method. The cost and profit estimates are determined at least quarterly for all significant contracts pursuant to a detailed process. The results of the process are subjected to reviews by senior management at each subsidiary. The percentage-of-completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion. This requires us to prepare on-going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses. In preparing these estimates, we make significant judgments and assumptions about our significant costs, including materials, labor and equipment, and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances, production delays or other productivity factors. Meaningful costs incurred on a particular contract that are related to materials or equipment items over which the corresponding project owner has yet to obtain control are excluded from the measurement of progress toward the satisfaction of the corresponding performance obligation determined as of the report date. As a result, the revenues recognized on the corresponding project are reduced.\nActual costs may vary from the costs we estimate. Variations from estimated contract costs, along with other risks inherent in fixed-price contracts, may result in actual revenues and gross profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects or other significant unfavorable impacts on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined, without regard to the percentage of completion. We believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts at each company going forward is limited by our management's experience in estimating contract costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses.\nCrucial to the compliance with the new standard for revenue recognition is the identification of the promises made to the customer by us that are included in the contract. If a promise is distinct, as that concept is defined in the new standard, it represents a separate performance obligation. Contracts may have multiple performance obligations. The amounts of revenue associated with each promise are recognized when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied. However, complex contracts may include only one performance obligation if the multiple promises are not distinct within the context of the contract. For example, if the promises that could be considered distinct are interrelated or require us to perform integration so that the customer receives a complete product, the contract is considered to include only one performance obligation. Most of our long-term contracts have a single performance obligation as the promises to transfer individual goods or services are not separately identifiable from other promises within the context of the contract. Our EPC contracts require us to deliver a complete and functioning power plant, not just functioning components.\nThe transaction price of a contract represents the value used to determine the amount of revenues recognized as of the balance sheet date. It may reflect amounts of variable consideration, which could be either increases or decreases to the transaction price. These adjustments can be made from time-to-time during the period of contract performance as circumstances evolve related to such items as variations in the scope and price of contracts, claims, incentives and liquidated damages.\nThe Company includes the estimated amount of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized on the particular contract will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's determination of the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price of a particular contract is based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. The effect of any revisions to the transaction price on the amount of previously recognized revenues that is due to the addition or reduction of variable consideration is recorded currently as an adjustment to revenues on a cumulative catch-up basis. In the event that any amounts of variable consideration that are reflected in the transaction price of a contract are not resolved in the Company's favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of, previously recognized revenues. In most significant instances, modifications to our contracts do not represent the addition of new performance obligations.\nUnpriced change orders, which represent contract variations for which we have project owner directive for additional work or authorization for scope changes but not for the price associated with the corresponding change, are included in the value of a contract, or the transaction price, when it is probable that the applicable costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. Amounts of identified change orders that are not yet considered probable as of the corresponding balance sheet date are excluded from the transaction price. Actual costs related to change orders are expensed as they are incurred. Contract results may be impacted by estimates of the amounts of contract variations that we expect to receive. The effects of any resulting revisions to revenues and estimated costs can be determined at any time and they could be material. As of January 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of unpriced change orders reflected in estimated transaction prices was $18.8 million. In general, contract variations that are unapproved in regard to both scope and price are included in the transaction price of a contract and consequently reflected in revenues only when an agreement on the amount has been reached with the project owner.\nOur long-term contracts typically have schedule dates and other performance obligations that, if not achieved, could subject us to liquidated damages. These contract requirements generally relate to specified activities that must be completed by an established date or by achievement of a specified level of output or efficiency. Each contract defines the conditions under which a project owner may make a claim for liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated damages owed to a project owner pursuant to the terms of a contract would represent a reduction of the transaction price of the corresponding contract.\nAt the outset of each of the Company's contracts, the potential amounts of liquidated damages typically are not constrained, or subtracted, from the transaction price as the Company believes that it has included activities in its contract plan, and has reflected the associated costs in its forecasts of completed contract costs, that will be effective in preventing such damages. Of course, circumstances may change as the Company executes the corresponding contract. The transaction price is reduced by an applicable amount when the Company no longer considers it probable that a future reversal of revenues will not occur when the matter is resolved. In general, we consider potential liquidated damages, the costs of other related items and potential mitigating factors in determining the estimates of forecasted revenues and the adequacy of our estimates of completed contract costs.\nGoodwill\nIn connection with the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC, we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names and certain fabrication process certifications. We utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in the initial determinations of goodwill and the other purchased intangible assets for these acquisitions. Other than goodwill, most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives.\nAt January 31, 2019, the goodwill balances related to the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC were $18.5 million, $12.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which together represented approximately 7% of consolidated total assets. The Company performs its required annual assessments of the carrying value of goodwill as of November 1 each year. We also test for impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired.\nIn accordance with current accounting guidance, we perform testing for the impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount of the unit reflected in the consolidated financial statements, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nIn certain situations, we use a simplified approach which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to decide whether it is necessary to perform the more complex quantitative goodwill impairment test. We are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than the corresponding carrying value. The professional guidance includes discussions of the types of factors which should be considered in conducting the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic, industry, market and entity-specific factors.\nAs of November 1, 2018, we considered the significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of GPS that was quantitatively determined in the past, its history of strong financial performance, its future business prospects and various other business environment and market conditions. We believe that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the GPS reporting unit exceeded the corresponding carrying value as of November 1, 2018. Therefore, completion of the complicated quantitative impairment assessment was considered to be unnecessary as of November 1, 2018. No events associated with the business of GPS occurred in the period from the assessment date through January 31, 2019 that would cause us to reconsider that conclusion.\nWe performed a goodwill impairment assessment for TRC as of November 1, 2018 with the assistance of a professional business valuation firm. It was determined that the fair value of TRC was less than the corresponding carrying value and a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million was recorded. The fair value amount for TRC determined as of November 1, 2018 reflected a weighting of results determined using various business valuation approaches. As in the past, the majority of the weighted average fair value was based on the result of modeling discounted future cash flows of the business. The discounted cash flows of TRC were based on our forecast of operating results. The forecast reflects an average annual growth in revenues of 4.9% over the next seven years with forecasted annual earnings before interest and taxes increasing to 6.5% of revenues by the year ending January 31, 2026.\nAlthough we believe that the projected financial results are reasonable considering the improved operating results achieved by TRC for the nine months ended October 31, 2018 and the current business prospects, any future results that would compare unfavorably with the projected results could result in additional material goodwill impairment losses. Further, unless TRC demonstates that it can contribute strong operating results that would justify favorable modifications to certain profitability assumptions, thereby supporting an increased fair value of the business in the future, additional goodwill impairment losses may occur. No events related to TRC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 that caused us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nWith the assistance of a professional business valuation firm, we also performed a full assessment of the fair value of APC as of November 1, 2018. The result concluded that no additional impairment of goodwill had occurred as the operating results and business prospects of APC continue to improve. We believe that the financial forecast for APC that we prepared and that was used in this valuation fairly reflected the effects that Brexit and suspended electricity generation capacity payments may have on our business. In our opinion, no events related to APC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 that would cause us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nAs disclosed in the \u201cResearch and Development Tax Credits\u201d section of Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during Fiscal 2019 we completed a detailed review of the activities of our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, we identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that were not previously recognized in our financial results for any prior year reporting period. In the determination of the amount of such benefits to recognize, we have been required to apply the professional accounting guidance related to meaningful uncertain income tax positions for the first time.\nUnder this guidance, income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Fiscal 2019 is the initial reporting period in which we had sufficient data on which to make an evaluation and to reach a conclusion on the amount of income tax credit benefits related to prior year project costs that, more likely than not, qualified as research and development costs under the IRC and the rules and regulations of certain states. The net amount of the credits that we recognized in income taxes during Fiscal 2019 was $16.6 million. Based on our judgement, the amount of income tax benefits related to identified research and development income tax credits that we have assessed as not meeting the threshold criteria for recognition was $5.1 million, for which we have established a liability related to uncertain income tax return positions that is included in accrued expenses as of January 31, 2019.\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nOur consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019 included deferred tax assets in the amount of $1.3 million. The components of our deferred tax amounts are presented in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These amounts reflect differences in the periods in which certain transactions are recognized for financial and income tax reporting purposes.\nIn assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including those related to the net operating losses of TRC and APC that applicable income tax rules will allow us to use in order to offset future amounts of taxable income, depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and assumptions regarding income amounts change in the\nfuture, we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of earnings. At this time, we believe that the historically strong earnings performance of our power industry services segment and the strengthening business of APC will provide sufficient income during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible to utilize the applicable temporary income tax differences. Accordingly, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of significantly all of our deferred tax assets.\nStock Options\nWe measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of stock option awards and we recognize the corresponding expense amounts over the vesting periods which were typically one year. However, starting in January 2018, stock option awards include three-year vesting periods. We expect that future awards will also vest over three years with one-third of the vesting occurring on each anniversary date of the corresponding award. Pursuant to our accounting, we will continue to record expense for the fair value of each stock option award ratably over the corresponding vesting period. Options to purchase 257,000, 301,500 and 270,000 shares of our common stock were awarded during Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with weighted average fair value per share amounts of $9.31, $13.55 and $14.93, respectively. The amounts of compensation expense recorded during the corresponding years related to vesting stock options were $1.6 million, $4.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The decline in the expense amount for Fiscal 2019 reflects the longer vesting periods of recent stock option awards.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of stock options. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computations, which are disclosed in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and include the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of each stock option. Changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of stock option awards. We believe that our stock option exercise activity has become sufficient to provide us with a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected lives. Accordingly, the estimated expected life used in the determination of the fair value of each stock option awarded since January 2017 is approximately 3.3 years. The use of longer estimated expected lives in our calculations would result in higher fair value amounts per share.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe must consolidate any VIE in which we have variable interests if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE; that is, if we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships and to make a significant judgment, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date. In the past, our evaluations have affirmed that, despite not having ownership interests in certain power plant development VIEs, GPS was the corresponding primary beneficiary due primarily to the significance of its loans to each entity, the risk that GPS could absorb significant losses if the development project was not successful, the opportunity for GPS to receive a development success fee and the commitment of the project developer in each case to award the large EPC contract for the construction of the power plant to GPS. As a result, the accounts of each VIE were included in our consolidated financial statements until project development efforts progressed on each one such that financial support was thereafter provided substantially by a pending investor. At this point in the life of each VIE, we deconsolidated it.\nCurrently, we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE that is performing project development activities for the construction of a new natural gas-fired power plant. Consideration for the engineering and financial support being provided to the entity by GPS included the right to negotiate the corresponding turnkey EPC contract for the project. The account balances of the VIE were included in our consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLegal Contingencies\nWe do become involved in legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us. At this time, we do not believe that any additional material loss is probable related to any of the current matters discussed herein. However, we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter. We review the status of each matter and assess the adequacy of the accrued expense balances at the end of each fiscal quarter, and make adjustments to the balances if necessary. Should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change, significant losses or additional costs may be recorded.\nFor example, GPS was in a dispute with a former subcontractor on one of its power plant construction projects that was settled pursuant to binding arbitration in June 2018. The arbitration panel awarded approximately $5.2 million, plus interest and arbitration fees, to the subcontractor. The substantial portion of the total amount, which was paid by GPS to the subcontractor in July 2018, was charged to cost of revenues. In connection with the settlement, the legal claims made by the parties against each other were dismissed with prejudice and without costs to the parties, all liens filed by the subcontractor related to the project were released, and each party provided the other with a release from future claims related to this matter.\nOn the other hand, the final outcome of a legal matter may result in the reversal of accrued liabilities established in prior periods. In February 2016, as disclosed in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, TRC was sued by PPS, a former subcontractor, in an attempt to force TRC to pay invoices for services rendered in the total amount of $2.3 million. In addition, PPS placed liens on the property of customers in several states where work was performed by PPS and it also filed a claim against the bond issued on behalf of TRC relating to one significant project. TRC filed responses asserting that PPS failed to deliver a number of items required by the applicable contract between the parties, that the invoices rendered by PPS covering the disputed services would not be paid until such deliverables were supplied, and that certain sums were owed to it by PPS for services, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and software that were supplied by TRC on behalf of PPS. The amounts invoiced by PPS were accrued by TRC and the corresponding liability amounts were included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet as January 31, 2018. TRC did not record an account receivable for the amounts it believed were owed to it by PPS. A mediation effort was attempted in 2016 but it was unproductive in resolving the disputes. In July 2018, the parties agreed to a settlement of all claims made against each other with TRC agreeing to make a payment to PPS in the amount of $0.9 million. As the total of the previously accrued amounts exceeded the negotiated settlement amount, the Company recorded a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1.4 million that was included in other income for Fiscal 2019.\nIn January 2019, GPS sued Exelon for breach of contract and failure to remedy various events which negatively impacted the schedule and costs of the Exelon West Medway II Facility resulting in Exelon receiving the benefits of GPS's work without making payment for the value. On March 7, 2019, Exelon notified us of its termination of the EPC services contract with GPS on the Exelon West Medway II Facility. At that time, the project was nearly complete and all units had reached first fire. Exelon has also asserted various claims against us and has withheld payments of billed amounts owed to us. GPS will vigorously assert its rights and claims to recover its lost value and to collect any remaining monies owed.\nAccounts Receivables and Contract Assets\nAs described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, our loss experience related to uncollectible amounts billed to customers has not been significant in the past. However, there is collection risk related to accounts receivable and retainage amounts due from the customer involved in the dispute discussed above. We believe that the underlying invoices were prepared and submitted to the customer pursuant to the terms of the contract, but the customer has not paid them when due. The last payment received from the customer was in January 2019. We believe that we are entitled to receive payments for these billings and we are confident that payments will be made. However, the collection time for these amounts, approximately $17.1 million in total, may be extended substantially and could depend on the resolution of the outstanding legal matter.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases, which amends the existing guidance and requires the recognition of operating leases in the balance sheet. For these leases, companies will record assets for the rights and liabilities for the obligations that are created by the leases. The pronouncement will require disclosures that provide qualitative and quantitative information for the lease assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements. We adopted this pronouncement on February 1, 2019 using the permitted modified retrospective approach. Accordingly, the Company will make the required additions to the consolidated balance sheet for right-to-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities in the range between $1.0 million to $2.0 million for operating leases existing on the adoption date.\nThe new accounting for leases is not expected to have a material effect on our operating results in the future. Prior year financial statements will not be restated. We do intend to make the \u201cshort-term\u201d election, as permitted by the new standard, not to apply the new accounting to those leases with terms of twelve (12) months or less and that do not include options to purchase the underlying assets that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Our material operating leases, representing arrangements with initial lease terms greater than one year, primarily cover office and manufacturing facilities. We do not have any material finance leases as of February 1, 2019.\nIn 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The scope of this new standard covers, among other provisions, the methods that businesses shall use to estimate amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable. As subsequently amended, we do not expect that the requirements of this new guidance, which becomes effective for us on February 1, 2020, will materially effect our consolidated financial statements.\nThere are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that we consider material to our consolidated financial statements.", "item_7_truncated": "We have entered into similar support arrangements with other independent parties in the past that resulted in the successful development and construction of three separate gas-fired power plants. In each case, we deconsolidated the corresponding VIE when we were no longer the primary beneficiary.\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Over 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commitment\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,714\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Totals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLegal Contingencies\nFor Fiscal 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $37.1 million resulting in an annual effective income tax rate of 32.4%. This annual rate differed from the expected federal income tax rate of 35.0% due to the favorable effect of the amounts of permanent differences for the year offset partially by the effect of state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, in the amount of $4.0 million. Most significantly, favorable permanent differences related to 1) the treatment of the excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2017, 2) the domestic production activities deduction and 3) the exclusion from taxable income of the income attributable to non-controlling interests which reduced income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 by $5.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 52,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 116,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40,343\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (35,869\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,979\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (659\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock option compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,651\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other noncash items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (301\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1,248\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Increase) decrease in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10,200\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (5,687\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (15,160\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (4,574\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (668\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (60,187\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (6,164\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 59,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in contracts in progress, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (83,774\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (136,448\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> 112,664\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (112,322\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (72,793\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 259,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for certain forward-looking statements.

We believe that replacement costs of our building, improvements, equipment and furniture will not materially affect our operations.\n\nThe revenues of the power industry services business decreased by $446.7 million to $367.8 million for Fiscal 2019 compared with revenues of $814.5 million for the prior year, representing a decrease of 55% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 76% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, and approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for the prior year. The decrease in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the commissioning, start-up and final activities of four EPC projects, which represented $175.5 million, or 36%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019. All four of these projects reached substantial completion during Fiscal 2019.\nFrom time to time, we may arrange for bonding to be issued by our surety firm for the benefit of the owner of an energy project for which we are not providing construction services. We collect fees from the provider of such services as consideration for the use of our bonding capacity. As of January 31, 2019, the total amount of outstanding surety bonds issued under such arrangements was $11.1 million.\nWe must consolidate any VIE in which we have variable interests if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE; that is, if we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships and to make a significant judgment, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date. In the past, our evaluations have affirmed that, despite not having ownership interests in certain power plant development VIEs, GPS was the corresponding primary beneficiary due primarily to the significance of its loans to each entity, the risk that GPS could absorb significant losses if the development project was not successful, the opportunity for GPS to receive a development success fee and the commitment of the project developer in each case to award the large EPC contract for the construction of the power plant to GPS. As a result, the accounts of each VIE were included in our consolidated financial statements until project development efforts progressed on each one such that financial support was thereafter provided substantially by a pending investor. At this point in the life of each VIE, we deconsolidated it.\nThe new accounting for leases is not expected to have a material effect on our operating results in the future. Prior year financial statements will not be restated. We do intend to make the \u201cshort-term\u201d election, as permitted by the new standard, not to apply the new accounting to those leases with terms of twelve (12) months or less and that do not include options to purchase the underlying assets that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Our material operating leases, representing arrangements with initial lease terms greater than one year, primarily cover office and manufacturing facilities. We do not have any material finance leases as of February 1, 2019.\nAs indicated above, the revenues of TRC declined for Fiscal 2018 and it reported operating losses during Fiscal 2018. With the decreased results in Fiscal 2018 and a less favorable outlook for TRC, our business valuation performed at that time indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value. As a result, TRC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2018 of approximately $0.6 million.\nThe favorable effects of research and development credits and the reduction in the corporate income tax rate in the US, which partially offset the 44.8% decrease in the amount of gross profit, were the primary reasons that we experienced a limited decrease of 27.7% in net income attributable to our stockholders for Fiscal 2019 to $52.0 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, from $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, in the prior year.\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) were $12.7 million for Fiscal 2019, compared with revenues of $13.0 million for the prior year as it nears completion of a large, multi-year, fiber-to-the-premises project for a municipal customer located in the state of Maryland.\nWe measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of stock option awards and we recognize the corresponding expense amounts over the vesting periods which were typically one year. However, starting in January 2018, stock option awards include three-year vesting periods. We expect that future awards will also vest over three years with one-third of the vesting occurring on each anniversary date of the corresponding award. Pursuant to our accounting, we will continue to record expense for the fair value of each stock option award ratably over the corresponding vesting period. Options to purchase 257,000, 301,500 and 270,000 shares of our common stock were awarded during Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with weighted average fair value per share amounts of $9.31, $13.55 and $14.93, respectively. The amounts of compensation expense recorded during the corresponding years related to vesting stock options were $1.6 million, $4.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The decline in the expense amount for Fiscal 2019 reflects the longer vesting periods of recent stock option awards.\nAccordingly, the income tax benefits associated with research and development activities conducted in prior years in the total amount of $16.6 million have been recognized in income taxes for Fiscal 2019. The favorable effect of this amount on diluted earnings per share was $1.06 for the year.\nWe had financial control of construction joint ventures formed for the purpose of building two power plants, which were completed in Fiscal 2017 and for which the respective warranty periods have expired. The statutory partnerships representing the joint venture entities were dissolved during the year ended January 31, 2019. The accounts of the joint ventures were included in our consolidated financial statements during the periods of their existence.\nOn May 15, 2017, we entered into the Credit Agreement with the Bank as lender which replaced a predecessor agreement and modified its features to, among other things:\nOther unfavorable factors include challenging energy capacity auctions for new power generating assets, the impacts of environmental activism and California's resolve to move towards 100% renewable energy. The growth of vocal support for 100% renewable energy and the support of numerous environmental groups provided motivation for the release of the Green New Deal Resolution by progressive members of the US Congress. The fostered increase in the number of protests against a variety of fossil-fuel related energy projects continue to garner media attention and public skepticism about new fossil-fuel energy projects, particularly oil and natural gas pipelines, resulting in project delays due to onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Pipeline approval delays may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to potentially new gas-fired power plant sites, thereby increasing the risk of power plant project delays or cancellations.\nAs reported by EIA for 2018, net electricity generation at utility-scale facilities in the US rose by 3.6% from the prior year level as net generation from natural gas, wind and solar sources increased by 13.2%, 8.1% and 25.0%, respectively. Moreover, the share of net electricity generation fueled by natural gas rose from approximately 31.7% in 2017 to 34.4% for 2018. The net electricity generation from coal declined by 4.9% for the year. In summary, the share of the electrical power generation mix fueled by natural gas has continued its increase in the current year, while the share fueled by coal has continued its fall.\nThe reported amount of our project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded to us that we consider to be firm as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding contracts. Cancellations or reductions may occur that may reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. Typically, we include the total value of an EPC service contract in project backlog when we receive a corresponding notice to proceed from the project owner. However, we may include the value of an EPC services contract prior to the receipt of a notice to proceed if we believe that it is probable that the project will commence within a reasonable timeframe, among other factors.\nThese costs were $41.8 million and $32.5 million for Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing approximately 4.7% and 4.8% of consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively. Approximately $5.6 million of the increase between the years was due to an overall increase in salaries and incentive compensation costs driven by increased operations and project work, primarily at GPS and APC. In addition, stock option compensation expense increased by approximately $2.3 million between the years, primarily due to increased market prices of our common stock at the date that the majority of the corresponding stock options were granted. The remaining $1.4 million increase from Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2018 related to increased contributions to employee retirement plans, employee separation costs and other expenses partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment decreased by 17%, or $13.7 million, to $65.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $79.0 million for Fiscal 2017. The largest portion of TRC's revenues were provided by industrial field services. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to revenues included in Fiscal 2017 associated with large loss projects with former customers that were in-process on the date of our acquisition of TRC and which were primarily completed during that year.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nDue primarily to the substantial increase in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, compared with consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased. These costs were $743.5 million and $528.3 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $149.3 million and $146.7 million, respectively. Our overall gross profit percentages of revenues were 16.7% and 21.7% for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The decline in the percentage between years reflected the favorable achievement of contractual final completion of two natural gas-fired power plant projects during Fiscal 2017 which eliminated a number of significant risks and the related estimated costs associated with them, resulting in increased gross margins.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment (representing the business of TRC) increased by 56%, or $36.4 million, to $101.7 million for Fiscal 2019 compared with revenues of $65.3 million for the prior year as business development efforts have succeeded in winning increased amounts of business from recurring as well as new customers. The largest portion of TRC's revenues continue to be provided by industrial field services and TRC's major customers include some of North America's largest forest products companies and fertilizer producers as well as energy and mining companies with plants located in the southeast region of the US.\nIn addition, GPS has been selected by project owners to provide EPC services in connection with the construction of several other power plant projects with projected start dates in Fiscal 2020. However, GPS has not completed contract negotiations nor received a full notice to proceed on any of these EPC projects, and there is always a possibility that one or more of these projects will not be built.\nWe believe that cash on hand, cash that will be provided from the maturities of short-term investments and cash generated from our future operations, with or without funds available under our line of credit, will be adequate to meet our general business needs in the foreseeable future. In particular, we maintain significant liquid capital on our balance sheet to help ensure our ability to maintain and obtain bonding capacity for current and future EPC and other construction projects. Any future acquisitions, or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement, may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, we completed a detailed review of the activities performed by our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits that may be available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, we identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that have not previously been recognized in our financial results for any prior year reporting period.\nThe Company includes the estimated amount of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized on the particular contract will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's determination of the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price of a particular contract is based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. The effect of any revisions to the transaction price on the amount of previously recognized revenues that is due to the addition or reduction of variable consideration is recorded currently as an adjustment to revenues on a cumulative catch-up basis. In the event that any amounts of variable consideration that are reflected in the transaction price of a contract are not resolved in the Company's favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of, previously recognized revenues. In most significant instances, modifications to our contracts do not represent the addition of new performance obligations.\n\u00b7 add an accordion feature which allows for an additional commitment amount of $10.0 million, subject to certain conditions; and\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had approximately $15.2 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, primarily to support our APC activities. However, we had no outstanding borrowings. In addition, the commercial bank that has supported the activities of TRC issued an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit on its behalf in the amount of $0.4 million.\nAt the holding company level, we intend to make additional acquisitions of and/or investments in companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that acquired companies will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows and value for our stockholders.\nThese estimates, judgments, and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets, liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nEven though net income for the period, including the favorable adjustments related to non-cash expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $80.1 million, cash used in operations exceeded this amount primarily due to the effects of the four major EPC projects active during the year. Because these projects were well past the peak of their respective milestone billing schedules, we experienced a net decrease during Fiscal 2018 in the amount of billings on current projects in excess of corresponding costs and estimated earnings, which represented a use of cash in the amount of $102.5 million. The increase in project owner retainage amounts on active construction contracts represented a use of cash in the amount of $33.9 million. Other uses of cash included increased other assets of $4.6 million, primarily reflecting increased income tax payments, and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $6.2 million, primarily reflecting the run-off of our warranty obligations related to power plants completed in prior years.\nImpairment Losses\nIn assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including those related to the net operating losses of TRC and APC that applicable income tax rules will allow us to use in order to offset future amounts of taxable income, depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and assumptions regarding income amounts change in the\n\u00b7 GPS reached substantial completion for four of its power plant projects.\n(2) Project activities were discontinued on March 7, 2019. At that time, the EPC project was nearly complete and first fire had been achieved on both of the power production units included in this gas-fired power plant (see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, included in Part I of this report for further information regarding this matter).\nFor Fiscal 2018 and 2017, this line item included interest income in the amounts of $5.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, earned on CDs and $0.7 million and $0.2 million of additional investment income earned on funds maintained in a money market account, respectively. For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, the weighted average annual interest rates of the CDs owned during the corresponding years were 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively, and the weighted average income rates related to the money market investments were 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, the weighted average initial terms-to-maturity of the CDs were 219 days and 166 days, respectively.\nFor example, GPS was in a dispute with a former subcontractor on one of its power plant construction projects that was settled pursuant to binding arbitration in June 2018. The arbitration panel awarded approximately $5.2 million, plus interest and arbitration fees, to the subcontractor. The substantial portion of the total amount, which was paid by GPS to the subcontractor in July 2018, was charged to cost of revenues. In connection with the settlement, the legal claims made by the parties against each other were dismissed with prejudice and without costs to the parties, all liens filed by the subcontractor related to the project were released, and each party provided the other with a release from future claims related to this matter.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe revenues of the power industry services business increased by $227.9 million to $814.5 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $586.6 million for Fiscal 2017, representing an increase of 39% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, and approximately 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017. The increase in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of the four large natural gas-fired power plant construction projects, which represented $747.5 million, or 84%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2017, the combined revenues associated with these four projects, which were all in their earlier phases, represented $465.8 million, or 69%, of consolidated revenues. Construction activity related to two other natural-gas fired power plant projects that were completed in Fiscal 2017 represented 14% of consolidated revenues for that year. In addition, revenue for APC increased substantially during Fiscal 2018, primarily due to revenues of $12.2 million associated with the initial construction activity for two power plant projects in the UK.\n\nThe total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the US in 2018 was the highest amount generated since 2007. In its latest base-case outlook, the US Energy Information Administration (the \u201cEIA\u201d) forecasts steady growth in net electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of approximately 1.0% per year. The growth rate is tempered by new electricity-efficient devices and production processes replacing older, less-efficient appliances, heating, cooling and ventilation systems and capital equipment. Nonetheless, the EIA forecasts continued growth for natural gas-fired electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of 1.2% per year. EIA expects the share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas-fired power plants in the US to rise from approximately 34% in 2018 to 37% in 2022 and to 39% by 2050. On the other hand, the generation share from coal is forecast to fall steadily during these periods, from 28% in 2018 to 23% in 2022 to 17% by 2050.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and\nThe following discussion summarizes the financial position of Argan, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of January 31, 2019, and the results of their operations for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201c2019 Annual Report\u201d).\nOur long-term contracts typically have schedule dates and other performance obligations that, if not achieved, could subject us to liquidated damages. These contract requirements generally relate to specified activities that must be completed by an established date or by achievement of a specified level of output or efficiency. Each contract defines the conditions under which a project owner may make a claim for liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated damages owed to a project owner pursuant to the terms of a contract would represent a reduction of the transaction price of the corresponding contract.\n\u00b7 We declared and paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.25, for a total of $1.00 during Fiscal 2019.\nOverview\nAs of November 1, 2018, we considered the significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of GPS that was quantitatively determined in the past, its history of strong financial performance, its future business prospects and various other business environment and market conditions. We believe that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the GPS reporting unit exceeded the corresponding carrying value as of November 1, 2018. Therefore, completion of the complicated quantitative impairment assessment was considered to be unnecessary as of November 1, 2018. No events associated with the business of GPS occurred in the period from the assessment date through January 31, 2019 that would cause us to reconsider that conclusion.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2019 and 2018\nDue primarily to the substantial decrease in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, compared with consolidated revenues for the prior year, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also decreased. These costs were $399.7 million and $743.5 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $82.4 million and $149.3 million, respectively.\n3. Determine the transaction price of the contract,\n\n\nThe following table presents our major power plant projects as of January 31, 2019:\nThe transaction price of a contract represents the value used to determine the amount of revenues recognized as of the balance sheet date. It may reflect amounts of variable consideration, which could be either increases or decreases to the transaction price. These adjustments can be made from time-to-time during the period of contract performance as circumstances evolve related to such items as variations in the scope and price of contracts, claims, incentives and liquidated damages.\nIncome Tax Expense\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we experienced labor and subcontractor costs that increased on certain now-completed projects to amounts greater than originally estimated. The corresponding increase in forecasted costs to complete these contracts and the associated reductions in the amount of forecasted gross margins resulted in reductions to the amount of consolidated gross profit reported last year.\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $52.0 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2019. For the prior year, we reported a comparable net income amount of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 (dollars in thousands).\nNotable accomplishments and other events for Fiscal 2019 included the following:\nFor Fiscal 2019 and 2018, this line item also includes interest income in the amounts of $4.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, earned on certificate of deposit investments purchased from our bank (\u201cCDs\u201d) and $1.8 million and $0.7 million of additional investment income earned on funds maintained in a money market fund, respectively. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the weighted average annual interest rates of the CDs owned during the corresponding years were 2.0% and 1.3%, respectively, and the weighted average income rates related to the money market investments were 1.9% and 0.8%, respectively. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the weighted average initial terms-to-maturity of the CDs were 250 days and 219 days, respectively.\n\u00b7 increase the Bank's lending commitment amount from $10.0 million to $50.0 million including a revolving loan with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.0%;\nRevenue Recognition\n\u00b7 Both APC and TRC achieved record amounts of revenues during Fiscal 2019.\nAs a result, we continue to believe that the future prospects for natural gas-fired power plant construction are favorable as natural gas has become the primary source for power generation in our country. Major advances in horizontal drilling and the practice of hydraulic fracturing have led to the boom in natural gas supply which is available at consistently low prices now and in the foreseeable future. The abundant availability of cheap, less carbon-intense and higher efficiency natural gas should continue to be a significant factor in the economic assessment of future power generation capacity additions. As indicated above, the demand for electric power in this country is expected to grow slowly but steadily over the long term. Demands for electricity, the ample supply of natural gas, and the future retirement of coal, nuclear and inefficient gas-fired energy plants, should result in modern natural gas-fired energy plants representing a substantial portion of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix. Moreover, the competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plant construction has changed significantly this year. Several significant competitors have announced that they are exiting the market for a variety of reasons. While the competitive market remains dynamic, we expect that there will be fewer competitors for new gas-fired power plant EPC project opportunities.\nThe net amount of cash used in operating activities during Fiscal 2019 was $112.3 million. Even though net income for the period, including the favorable adjustments related to non-cash income and expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $57.0 million, cash used in operations exceeded this amount. As discussed above, four major EPC projects achieved substantial completion in the current year, representing the primary driver for the use of cash by contracts-in-progress during the current year in the amount of $83.8 million. These projects were well past the peak of their respective milestone billing schedules. Due primarily to these projects, the amounts of billings in excess of the amounts of the corresponding costs and estimated earnings declined by $99.7 million during Fiscal 2019, which represented a substantial use of cash. Partially offsetting this effect, the Company collected amounts of billings previously retained by project owners which provided $48.7 million in cash during the period.\n(4) A limited notice to proceed with certain preliminary design and site preparation activities was issued to GPS in January 2019. We expect to receive FNTP in the spring of 2019.\nAs described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, our loss experience related to uncollectible amounts billed to customers has not been significant in the past. However, there is collection risk related to accounts receivable and retainage amounts due from the customer involved in the dispute discussed above. We believe that the underlying invoices were prepared and submitted to the customer pursuant to the terms of the contract, but the customer has not paid them when due. The last payment received from the customer was in January 2019. We believe that we are entitled to receive payments for these billings and we are confident that payments will be made. However, the collection time for these amounts, approximately $17.1 million in total, may be extended substantially and could depend on the resolution of the outstanding legal matter.\n\u00b7 extend the maturity date three years from May 31, 2018 to May 31, 2021.\nOther Income\nIn August 2018, the administration of President Trump moved to formally replace the Clean Power Plan, an environmental regulation intended by the prior administration to be the single-most important step America has ever taken to fight climate change. The new proposal, called the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, would be more favorable to the coal industry by allowing individual states greater authority to make their own plans for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. However, even without the regulation, the US has seen a decline in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants as the supply of inexpensive natural gas and the growth in renewable energy have moved more energy providers away from coal. In addition, the coal-fired power plant fleet is generally old. It is expensive to keep the coal plants running, and they are not competitive in the market. Nevertheless, in some cases, the new plan may encourage the continued operation of old coal plants that might otherwise be retired without any government intervention.\nWith the assistance of a professional business valuation firm, we also performed a full assessment of the fair value of APC as of November 1, 2018. The result concluded that no additional impairment of goodwill had occurred as the operating results and business prospects of APC continue to improve. We believe that the financial forecast for APC that we prepared and that was used in this valuation fairly reflected the effects that Brexit and suspended electricity generation capacity payments may have on our business. In our opinion, no events related to APC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 that would cause us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nIn certain situations, we use a simplified approach which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to decide whether it is necessary to perform the more complex quantitative goodwill impairment test. We are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than the corresponding carrying value. The professional guidance includes discussions of the types of factors which should be considered in conducting the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic, industry, market and entity-specific factors.\nThe primary source of cash required to fund operations during Fiscal 2019 was the net maturity of short-term investments (CDs purchased from our Bank) in the amount of $179.0 million. Non-operating activities used cash during the current year, including primarily the payment of four quarterly cash dividends in the total amount of $15.6 million. Our operating subsidiaries also used cash during Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $8.6 million to fund capital expenditures. As of January 31, 2019, there were no restrictions with respect to inter-company payments from GPS, TRC, APC or SMC to the holding company.\nThrough GPS and APC, which together provided 76%, 91% and 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development, technical and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets. The wide range of customers includes independent power producers, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. Including consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d), GPS and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern region of the US and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as piping systems, pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Through SMC, which conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation. We have a line of credit committed by the Bank in the amount of $50.0 million for general purposes. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover standby letters of credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately $15.2 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but no borrowings.\n(1) Full Notice-to-Proceed (\u201cFNTP\u201d) represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence all of the activities covered by the corresponding contract.\nHowever, the Company's overall gross profit percentage of 17.1% of consolidated revenues was higher for Fiscal 2019 compared to a percentage of 16.7% for Fiscal 2018, which was due to an improvement in the gross profit percentage of the power industry services segment. As indicated above, the results for the year were primarily driven by execution on the commissioning, start-up and final phases of four natural gas-fired power plant projects, all of which have reached substantial completion. These achievements resulted in our making favorable project close-out adjustments to the gross profits of certain large projects. Unfavorable gross profit adjustments on certain smaller projects active at year-end partially offset the impacts of the favorable project closeouts. These projects have experienced cost increases due to a number of factors, including the identification of certain areas where estimated cost assumptions were too optimistic and the encounter of unforeseen construction, labor, weather, subcontractor, contractual and owner challenges as well as other performance difficulties that may continue to impact our operating results until the projects reach completion.\nAt January 31, 2019, most of our balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in a high-quality money market fund with at least 99.5% of its total assets invested in cash, U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements secured by US Treasury obligations. Most of our domestic operating bank accounts are maintained with the Bank. We do maintain certain Euro-based bank accounts in the Republic of Ireland, certain pound sterling-based bank accounts in the UK and insignificant bank accounts in other countries in support of the operations of APC.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\n\u00b7 We maintained overall profitability levels as consolidated gross profit and net income attributable to our stockholders, expressed as percentages of consolidated revenues, were 17.1% and 10.8%, respectively.\nWe enter into EPC and other long-term construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids or in conjunction with our support of the development of power plant projects. The types of contracts may vary. However, the EPC contracts of our power industry services reporting segment, and most other large contracts awarded to our other companies, are fixed-price contracts. Revenues are recognized primarily over time as performance obligations are satisfied due to the continuous transfer of control to the project owner or other customer.\nOur primary source of this cash during Fiscal 2018 was the net maturity of short-term investments in the amount of $45.0 million. In addition, the exercise of options to purchase 109,500 shares of our common stock provided us with cash proceeds in the approximate amount of $3.2 million. Non-operating activity cash uses included primarily the payment of a cash dividend of $15.5 million. During Fiscal 2018, we also used cash as our consolidated joint ventures made distributions to our joint venture partner in the total amount of $1.2 million. Our operating subsidiaries used cash during Fiscal 2018 in the amount of $4.8 million for capital expenditures and GPS funded $1.5 million in development loans to various power facility project development entities.\nAs disclosed in the \u201cResearch and Development Tax Credits\u201d section of Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during Fiscal 2019 we completed a detailed review of the activities of our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, we identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that were not previously recognized in our financial results for any prior year reporting period. In the determination of the amount of such benefits to recognize, we have been required to apply the professional accounting guidance related to meaningful uncertain income tax positions for the first time.\n\u00b7 After a lengthy and extensive study, we recorded income tax credit benefits associated with increasing research and development activities in our financial results for Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $16.6 million.\nAt the outset of each of the Company's contracts, the potential amounts of liquidated damages typically are not constrained, or subtracted, from the transaction price as the Company believes that it has included activities in its contract plan, and has reflected the associated costs in its forecasts of completed contract costs, that will be effective in preventing such damages. Of course, circumstances may change as the Company executes the corresponding contract. The transaction price is reduced by an applicable amount when the Company no longer considers it probable that a future reversal of revenues will not occur when the matter is resolved. In general, we consider potential liquidated damages, the costs of other related items and potential mitigating factors in determining the estimates of forecasted revenues and the adequacy of our estimates of completed contract costs.\nAs discussed above, we recorded an income tax benefit for Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $4.7 million which reflected the amount of the benefit associated with research and development credits generated during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018 in the amount of $16.6 million that we recorded during the current year.\nWe maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in the engineering, procurement and construction contracts. For certain projects, we are required by project owners to provide guarantees related to our services or work. If our services under a guaranteed project would not be completed or would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable, we would record such guaranteed losses.\nAlthough we believe that the projected financial results are reasonable considering the improved operating results achieved by TRC for the nine months ended October 31, 2018 and the current business prospects, any future results that would compare unfavorably with the projected results could result in additional material goodwill impairment losses. Further, unless TRC demonstates that it can contribute strong operating results that would justify favorable modifications to certain profitability assumptions, thereby supporting an increased fair value of the business in the future, additional goodwill impairment losses may occur. No events related to TRC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 that caused us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe gross profit percentage for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected execution on the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of four natural gas-fired power plant projects of GPS. However, during Fiscal 2018, certain of the natural gas-fired power plant projects had experienced meaningful increased labor and subcontractor costs to amounts greater than originally estimated. The increases in forecasted costs to complete these contracts and the corresponding reductions in the amounts of forecasted gross margins resulted in a reduction to consolidated gross profit being recognized during the latter half of Fiscal 2018. The gross profit percentage increased at APC and SMC and decreased at TRC, resulting in a net aggregate gross profit percent decrease of 1.0% of the combined revenues of the non-GPS entities between the years.\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2018. For Fiscal 2017, we reported a comparable net income amount of $70.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (dollars in thousands).\nOn the other hand, the final outcome of a legal matter may result in the reversal of accrued liabilities established in prior periods. In February 2016, as disclosed in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, TRC was sued by PPS, a former subcontractor, in an attempt to force TRC to pay invoices for services rendered in the total amount of $2.3 million. In addition, PPS placed liens on the property of customers in several states where work was performed by PPS and it also filed a claim against the bond issued on behalf of TRC relating to one significant project. TRC filed responses asserting that PPS failed to deliver a number of items required by the applicable contract between the parties, that the invoices rendered by PPS covering the disputed services would not be paid until such deliverables were supplied, and that certain sums were owed to it by PPS for services, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and software that were supplied by TRC on behalf of PPS. The amounts invoiced by PPS were accrued by TRC and the corresponding liability amounts were included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet as January 31, 2018. TRC did not record an account receivable for the amounts it believed were owed to it by PPS. A mediation effort was attempted in 2016 but it was unproductive in resolving the disputes. In July 2018, the parties agreed to a settlement of all claims made against each other with TRC agreeing to make a payment to PPS in the amount of $0.9 million. As the total of the previously accrued amounts exceeded the negotiated settlement amount, the Company recorded a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1.4 million that was included in other income for Fiscal 2019.\nWe consider ourselves to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE formed last year by an independent firm for the purpose of developing a natural gas-fired power plant. Pursuant to agreements negotiated with the developer, we are lending funds to the VIE to cover certain costs of the project development effort. The development phase activities of the VIE are focused on 1) obtaining the necessary permits to build and operate the power plant, 2) completing arrangements to connect the power plant to the fuel supply and the electricity grid, 3) engaging energy plant operators in negotiations for the purchase of project ownership interests, and 4) securing permanent financing for the project, with financial closing expected to occur during calendar year 2019. As we are the primary beneficiary of this VIE during the development phase, it is included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019.\nImpairment Losses\n1. Identify the contract,\nIn 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The scope of this new standard covers, among other provisions, the methods that businesses shall use to estimate amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable. As subsequently amended, we do not expect that the requirements of this new guidance, which becomes effective for us on February 1, 2020, will materially effect our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, our combined balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased by $45.1 million to $122.1 million as of January 31, 2018 from a balance of $167.2 million as of January 31, 2017. During this same year, our working capital increased by $64.6 million to $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018 from $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017.\nIn January 2019, GPS sued Exelon for breach of contract and failure to remedy various events which negatively impacted the schedule and costs of the Exelon West Medway II Facility resulting in Exelon receiving the benefits of GPS's work without making payment for the value. On March 7, 2019, Exelon notified us of its termination of the EPC services contract with GPS on the Exelon West Medway II Facility. At that time, the project was nearly complete and all units had reached first fire. Exelon has also asserted various claims against us and has withheld payments of billed amounts owed to us. GPS will vigorously assert its rights and claims to recover its lost value and to collect any remaining monies owed.\nImpairment losses were recorded during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 related to the goodwill of TRC in the amounts of $1.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The business valuations, which were performed for each year based on a blend of results determined by several income and market approaches, indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value at each testing date. Drivers for the impairment loss recorded in Fiscal 2019 included the increased carrying value of the business (reflecting the improved operating results for the current year), increased working capital requirements, reduced profit margins and appropriate changes to certain statistical factors. For Fiscal 2018, the impairment loss related primarily to the use of forecasted financial results which presented a less favorable outlook for TRC at that time than in prior years reflecting a trend of actual revenues below previous expectations and operating losses incurred during the year.\n(3) A FNTP has not been received and the scheduled completion date has not been established definitively as of January 31, 2019.\nAt January 31, 2019, the goodwill balances related to the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC were $18.5 million, $12.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which together represented approximately 7% of consolidated total assets. The Company performs its required annual assessments of the carrying value of goodwill as of November 1 each year. We also test for impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired.\n\u00b7 The adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard resulted in an immaterial change to our retained earnings and minimal changes to our ongoing revenue recognition.\nfuture, we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of earnings. At this time, we believe that the historically strong earnings performance of our power industry services segment and the strengthening business of APC will provide sufficient income during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible to utilize the applicable temporary income tax differences. Accordingly, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of significantly all of our deferred tax assets.\nOur consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019 included deferred tax assets in the amount of $1.3 million. The components of our deferred tax amounts are presented in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These amounts reflect differences in the periods in which certain transactions are recognized for financial and income tax reporting purposes.\nHowever, as EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with US GAAP, we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the results of our operations presented in accordance with US GAAP that are included in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our EBITDA does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nAs is common in our industry, EPC contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of executing a project or program for a project owner. These teaming arrangements are generally dissolved upon completion of the project or program. In addition, as discussed previously, we may obtain interests in VIEs formed by its owners for a specific purpose.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nAccounts Receivables and Contract Assets\nUnder this guidance, income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Fiscal 2019 is the initial reporting period in which we had sufficient data on which to make an evaluation and to reach a conclusion on the amount of income tax credit benefits related to prior year project costs that, more likely than not, qualified as research and development costs under the IRC and the rules and regulations of certain states. The net amount of the credits that we recognized in income taxes during Fiscal 2019 was $16.6 million. Based on our judgement, the amount of income tax benefits related to identified research and development income tax credits that we have assessed as not meeting the threshold criteria for recognition was $5.1 million, for which we have established a liability related to uncertain income tax return positions that is included in accrued expenses as of January 31, 2019.\nAt January 31, 2019 and 2018, our balances of cash and cash equivalents were $164.3 million and $122.1 million, respectively. During this same period, our working capital increased by $32.3 million to $334.1 million as of January 31, 2019 from $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018.\nWe do become involved in legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us. At this time, we do not believe that any additional material loss is probable related to any of the current matters discussed herein. However, we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter. We review the status of each matter and assess the adequacy of the accrued expense balances at the end of each fiscal quarter, and make adjustments to the balances if necessary. Should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change, significant losses or additional costs may be recorded.\nStock Options\nRevenues\nMarket Outlook\nContractual obligations outstanding as of January 31, 2019 are summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nWe do procure steel and other commodities for use in our construction projects. These materials can be subject to significant price fluctuations. For example, raw steel prices increased sharply at the beginning of calendar 2018, driven by a bullish market in commodities and industrial metals, as well as by import tariffs imposed by the US. During most of 2018, domestic steel prices remained at seven-year highs. However, steel prices have showed slower momentum recently and current domestic steel prices appear in a downtrend. On the other hand, the well-publicized shortage of skilled construction workers has been accompanied recently by corresponding wage increases at rates higher than those experienced since the recession in 2007. We strive to include the anticipated increases in the prices of equipment and commodity materials and the expected rise in labor rates as we estimate costs and prepare prices associated with bidding for new work. Although we have not been adversely affected by price fluctuations and wage increases to any significant extent in the past, there is no assurance that we will not be in the future.\nLast year, the combined revenues associated with the four gas-fired power plant projects, which were in peak and post-peak construction activity stages, represented approximately 84% of consolidated revenues for the year. Three other power plant projects reached peak construction activities during Fiscal 2019 including two projects located in the UK which are scheduled for completion in Fiscal 2020. They represented 33% of consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2019 compared to 5% of consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2018.\nIn accordance with current accounting guidance, we perform testing for the impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount of the unit reflected in the consolidated financial statements, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWe reported in previous filings that we expected the revenues of GPS to decrease significantly in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018, which they did. We anticipate adding new EPC services contracts to our growing project backlog and beginning work on the new projects in the first half of the year ending January 31, 2020 (\u201cFiscal 2020\u201d) as discussed below. However, it takes time for us to ramp-up meaningful revenues associated with new EPC projects due to the timing of when we receive full notices to proceed with all construction efforts and the overall project life-cycles of gas-fired power plants. Therefore, we expect to continue to report reduced consolidated revenues for the first half of Fiscal 2020 as we begin preliminary design and site preparation activities and prepare for the early stages of expected new projects. We are optimistic that we will see a resumption of year-to-year growth for the entire Company as new EPC service projects of GPS mature. Additional new EPC service project opportunities exist and, as reported in previous filings, negotiations continue with project owners for several new projects. Project backlog was approximately $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2019 compared with $0.4 billion as of January 31, 2018.\nAs presented above, the operations of TRC and APC have experienced meaningful growth in revenues this year. As expected, the increase in the level of business resulted in an increase in the amount of working capital required to support the growth. Accordingly, the amounts of costs incurred and estimated earnings recognized on certain active projects in excess of the amounts billed on those projects rose during Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $33.8 million, which represents a use of cash. Similarly, due in part to increased activity at these operating subsidiaries, accounts receivable increased during Fiscal 2019, a use of cash in the amount of $10.2 million. The Company also used cash in the amount of $60.2 million to reduce the level of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Due primarily to the inclusion of expected income tax refunds, the balance of other assets increased by $15.2 million during Fiscal 2019, representing a use of cash.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of stock options. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computations, which are disclosed in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and include the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of each stock option. Changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of stock option awards. We believe that our stock option exercise activity has become sufficient to provide us with a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected lives. Accordingly, the estimated expected life used in the determination of the fair value of each stock option awarded since January 2017 is approximately 3.3 years. The use of longer estimated expected lives in our calculations would result in higher fair value amounts per share.\nCost of Revenues\nInflation\nAs construction activity on four large natural gas-fired power plants wound down during the current year, our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019 declined to $482.2 million from $892.8 million for Fiscal 2018 when the construction activity on all of these projects were at peak or near-peak levels. However, we are encouraged by the growth in the revenues of our other operating units (TRC, APC and SMC) which more than doubled in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018. Our gross profit for Fiscal 2019 was $82.4 million compared with $149.3 million for Fiscal 2018, reflecting primarily the reduction in consolidated revenues between periods. However, our gross margin percentage increased to 17.1% for Fiscal 2019 from 16.7% for the prior year.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, GPS entered into three EPC services contracts to construct state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plants, having an aggregate power output of approximately 4.0 gigawatts. In addition to the Reidsville Energy Center and the Guernsey Power Station, which are included in the table presented above and reflected in our project backlog as of January 31, 2019, GPS has entered into an EPC services contract to construct the Chickahominy Power Station, a 1,600 MW natural gas-fired power plant, in Charles City County, Virginia. Even though we are providing financial and technical support to the project development effort through a consolidated VIE, we have not included the value of this contract in our project backlog.\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nOver the next three years, EIA forecasts that 72 gigawatts of new wind and photovoltaic solar capacity will be added in the US attributable to declining equipment costs and the availability of valuable tax credits. As these credits decline and then expire early in the next decade, the wind capacity additions will slow. Although tax incentives related to solar power also expire, the continuing decline in the cost of solar power equipment is predicted to sustain the growth of photovoltaic solar power generation facilities. However, persistent low natural gas prices, lower power plant operating costs and higher energy generating efficiencies should sustain the demand for modern combined cycle gas-fired power plants in the future. As a result, the long-term trends in electricity generation through 2050 are dominated by natural gas-fired and solar capacity additions.\nBusiness Description\nFor Fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $40.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 35.8%. The annual income tax rate was higher than our blended federal income tax rate of 33.8% for Fiscal 2018 due primarily to the $5.0 million unfavorable effect of state income taxes, offset partially by the favorable $3.2 million effect of the domestic production activities deduction and by the excess income tax benefit associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2018 with a favorable effect of $0.9 million. The latter benefit declined significantly between years as the volume of stock option exercises decreased in Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2017, we also obtained substantial benefit from the exclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interests in joint ventures which were consolidated for financial reporting purposes (see the next paragraph); for Fiscal 2018, the income tax benefit of the exclusion was only $0.1 million due to the substantial wind-up of activities by the joint ventures at that time. In addition, as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company revalued its deferred taxes as of December 22, 2017 and recognized an income tax benefit of $0.8 million for Fiscal 2018.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nContractual Obligations\n5. Recognize revenue.\nWe have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Bank's consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank will continue to require that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each fiscal quarter-end. The Credit Agreement includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature. At January 31, 2019 and 2018, we were compliant with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We may use the borrowing ability to cover other credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business.\nAs required by current accounting requirements, we performed a goodwill impairment assessment for TRC as of November 1, 2018, using the assistance of a professional business valuation firm. Although it was determined that the fair value of TRC was approximately the same value as determined as of November 1, 2017, the current year amount was less than the corresponding carrying value and we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million that is included in the consolidated statement of earnings for Fiscal 2019. Last year, a smaller goodwill impairment loss in the amount of $0.6 million was recorded. The remaining balance of goodwill for TRC that is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019, after reduction for impairment losses, was $12.3 million.\nIn Fiscal 2017, the revenues of APC declined and it reported operating losses. In July 2016, work was suspended on APC's largest project at the time, which represented over 90% of APC's project backlog. Additionally, the pound sterling drop, financial market uncertainty and recessionary pressures related to Brexit were thought to likely impact the availability of financing for future power plant developments. Given these circumstances, analyses were performed mid-year in order to determine whether an impairment loss related to goodwill had been incurred. Using income and market approaches, the assessment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value at that time. As a result, APC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2017 of approximately $2.0 million.\nCentral to the new revenue recognition guidance is a five-step revenue recognition model that requires reporting entities to:\nPower Industry Services\nThese costs were $40.7 million and $41.8 million for Fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a 3% decrease between the years. Stock compensation expense decreased by approximately $3.0 million between the years, primarily due to increased vesting periods associated with new stock option awards and incentive compensation decreased by $2.7 million, reflecting the reduced operations at GPS. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased non-chargeable staff costs and professional services costs.\nOver the last few years, our ability to run our business in a manner that provides consistent financial results has been unfavorably impacted by the lengthening time between the conception of a power plant project and the commencement of construction activities. We believe that the resulting delays in new business awards to GPS relates, in part, to the soft demand for electricity, especially in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the US. In addition, as explained below, there is uncertainty surrounding the level of regulatory support for coal as part of the energy mix, an increase in the amount of power generating capacity provided by renewable energy assets and increasing interest in renewable energy storage solutions. Together with the difficulties experienced by project developers in obtaining project financing, these factors may be impacting the planning and initiation phases for the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants which continue to be deferred by project owners.\nWe believe that EBITDA, a non-US GAAP financial measurement, is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure, the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions. Further, we believe that EBITDA is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance.\nResearch and Development Credits\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nDescriptions of the Company's significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, are included in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019. We consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long-term construction contracts; income tax reporting; the accounting for business combinations; the subsequent valuation of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the valuation of employee stock options; and the financial reporting associated with any significant claims or legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, as well as the accounting and reporting for special purpose entities including joint ventures and variable interest entities. Critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in arriving at estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions.\nCurrently, we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE that is performing project development activities for the construction of a new natural gas-fired power plant. Consideration for the engineering and financial support being provided to the entity by GPS included the right to negotiate the corresponding turnkey EPC contract for the project. The account balances of the VIE were included in our consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nActual costs may vary from the costs we estimate. Variations from estimated contract costs, along with other risks inherent in fixed-price contracts, may result in actual revenues and gross profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects or other significant unfavorable impacts on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined, without regard to the percentage of completion. We believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts at each company going forward is limited by our management's experience in estimating contract costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses.\nVariable Interest Entities\n2. Identify the performance obligations of the contract,\nArgan is a holding company that conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, GPS, APC, SMC and TRC.\nThe Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changed tax law in the US by, among other changes, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% (effective January 1, 2018). As expected, our annual effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2019, before the benefits of the research and development credits discussed above and a favorable net operating loss carryforward adjustment, decreased meaningfully to 29.5% from the comparable effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 of 35.8%, primarily due to the lower statutory tax rate. However, certain modifications of the Tax Act negatively impacted our effective rate, including the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction, the expansion of the limitation on the deductibility of certain meals and entertainment expenses and additional limits on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. The effective tax rate of 29.5% is higher than the new federal income tax rate of 21% due primarily to the unfavorable effect of state income taxes.\nThere are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that we consider material to our consolidated financial statements.\nGPS and APC are completing certain projects that are confronting significant operational and contractual challenges, and our operating results for Fiscal 2019 reflect unfavorable gross profit adjustments on these jobs which are both behind the schedules originally established for these jobs. These projects may continue to impact our operating results negatively until they reach completion.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC, we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names and certain fabrication process certifications. We utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in the initial determinations of goodwill and the other purchased intangible assets for these acquisitions. Other than goodwill, most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives.\nRevenues from fixed price contracts, including a portion of estimated profit, are recognized over time, based on costs incurred and estimated total contract costs using the percentage-of-completion method. The cost and profit estimates are determined at least quarterly for all significant contracts pursuant to a detailed process. The results of the process are subjected to reviews by senior management at each subsidiary. The percentage-of-completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion. This requires us to prepare on-going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses. In preparing these estimates, we make significant judgments and assumptions about our significant costs, including materials, labor and equipment, and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances, production delays or other productivity factors. Meaningful costs incurred on a particular contract that are related to materials or equipment items over which the corresponding project owner has yet to obtain control are excluded from the measurement of progress toward the satisfaction of the corresponding performance obligation determined as of the report date. As a result, the revenues recognized on the corresponding project are reduced.\nCost of Revenues\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of January 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe new guidance focuses on the transfer of the contractor's control of the goods and/or services to the customer, as opposed to the transfer of risk and rewards. Major provisions cover the determination of which goods and services are distinct and represent separate performance obligations, the appropriate treatment of variable consideration, and the evaluation of whether revenues should be recognized at a point in time or over time. Application of the new rules requires us to make important judgements and meaningful estimates that may have significant impact on the amounts of revenues recognized by us for a reporting period.\nFor Fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $40.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 35.8% as stated above. The annual income tax rate was higher than the blended federal income tax rate of 33.8% for Fiscal 2018 due primarily to the $5.0 million unfavorable effect of state income taxes, offset partially by the favorable $3.2 million effect of the domestic production activities deduction and by the excess income tax benefit associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2018 with a favorable effect of $0.9 million. In addition, as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, we revalued deferred taxes as of December 22, 2017 and recognized an income tax benefit of $0.8 million in Fiscal 2018.\n\nCrucial to the compliance with the new standard for revenue recognition is the identification of the promises made to the customer by us that are included in the contract. If a promise is distinct, as that concept is defined in the new standard, it represents a separate performance obligation. Contracts may have multiple performance obligations. The amounts of revenue associated with each promise are recognized when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied. However, complex contracts may include only one performance obligation if the multiple promises are not distinct within the context of the contract. For example, if the promises that could be considered distinct are interrelated or require us to perform integration so that the customer receives a complete product, the contract is considered to include only one performance obligation. Most of our long-term contracts have a single performance obligation as the promises to transfer individual goods or services are not separately identifiable from other promises within the context of the contract. Our EPC contracts require us to deliver a complete and functioning power plant, not just functioning components.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nUnpriced change orders, which represent contract variations for which we have project owner directive for additional work or authorization for scope changes but not for the price associated with the corresponding change, are included in the value of a contract, or the transaction price, when it is probable that the applicable costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. Amounts of identified change orders that are not yet considered probable as of the corresponding balance sheet date are excluded from the transaction price. Actual costs related to change orders are expensed as they are incurred. Contract results may be impacted by estimates of the amounts of contract variations that we expect to receive. The effects of any resulting revisions to revenues and estimated costs can be determined at any time and they could be material. As of January 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of unpriced change orders reflected in estimated transaction prices was $18.8 million. In general, contract variations that are unapproved in regard to both scope and price are included in the transaction price of a contract and consequently reflected in revenues only when an agreement on the amount has been reached with the project owner.\nAs we believe that our net cash flow provided by or used in operations is the most directly comparable performance measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d), the following table reconciles the amounts of EBITDA for the applicable periods, as presented above, to the corresponding amounts of net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (amounts in thousands).\n\nRevenues\nIn summary, the development of natural gas-fired power generation facilities in the US should continue to provide new construction opportunities for us, although the pace of new opportunities emerging may be restrained in the near term as discussed above. We are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects and the future growth of our revenues. This may result in our decision to make investments in the development and/or ownership of new projects. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider certain opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks in order to assure the award of the related EPC services contract to us. We believe that the Company has a growing reputation as an accomplished and cost-effective provider of EPC and other large project construction contracting services in the US, the UK and Ireland. With the proven ability to deliver completed power facilities, particularly combined cycle, natural gas-fired power plants, we are focused on expanding our position in the power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of electricity demand covering decades into the future. We believe that our expectations are valid and that our plans for the future continue to be based on reasonable assumptions.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we entered separate construction joint ventures related to two natural gas-fired power plant projects. Because we had financial control at that time, the joint ventures were included in our consolidated financial statements. Our joint venture partner's share of the earnings is reflected in the line item captioned net income attributable to non-controlling interests included in the accompanying statements of earnings for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 in the amounts of $0.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The reduction in the amount between years primarily reflected the contractual completion of the projects in Fiscal 2017, with the provision of warranty services being the primary remaining obligations of the joint ventures in Fiscal 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. We consider Fiscal 2019 as the initial reporting period in which we had sufficient data on which to make an evaluation and reach a conclusion on the amount of income tax credit benefits related to prior year project costs that, more likely than not, qualified as research and development costs under the rules and regulations of the IRS and certain states.\nWe performed a goodwill impairment assessment for TRC as of November 1, 2018 with the assistance of a professional business valuation firm. It was determined that the fair value of TRC was less than the corresponding carrying value and a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million was recorded. The fair value amount for TRC determined as of November 1, 2018 reflected a weighting of results determined using various business valuation approaches. As in the past, the majority of the weighted average fair value was based on the result of modeling discounted future cash flows of the business. The discounted cash flows of TRC were based on our forecast of operating results. The forecast reflects an average annual growth in revenues of 4.9% over the next seven years with forecasted annual earnings before interest and taxes increasing to 6.5% of revenues by the year ending January 31, 2026.\nExecution on Project Backlog\nEIA forecasts that coal-fired generating capacity will decrease by 101 gigawatts, or 42% of existing coal-fired capacity, by 2050, with most of the capacity reductions occurring by 2025. In addition, another 22 gigawatts of nuclear, or 22% of current nuclear power capacity, is expected to be retired by 2050. The retirements of coal and nuclear plants typically result in the need for new capacity. New natural gas-fired plants, which have experienced a significant increase in their ability to generate power efficiently, are relatively cheaper to build than coal, nuclear, or renewable plants, they are substantially more environmentally friendly than conventional coal-fired power plants and they represent the most economical way to meet base loads and peak demands and to maintain grid reliability. As natural gas is relatively clean burning, cost-effective and reliable, its benefits as a source of power generation are compelling. As the use of coal declines, the use of nuclear energy stalls, and the integration of increasing amounts of wind and solar power into energy grids continues (including renewable energy storage solutions), power providers should continue to value gas-fired electricity generation, including when needed to support intermittent renewable energy supplies. As indicated above, the share of the mix represented by wind farms\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases, which amends the existing guidance and requires the recognition of operating leases in the balance sheet. For these leases, companies will record assets for the rights and liabilities for the obligations that are created by the leases. The pronouncement will require disclosures that provide qualitative and quantitative information for the lease assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements. We adopted this pronouncement on February 1, 2019 using the permitted modified retrospective approach. Accordingly, the Company will make the required additions to the consolidated balance sheet for right-to-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities in the range between $1.0 million to $2.0 million for operating leases existing on the adoption date.\nWe may enter into other support arrangements in the future in connection with power plant development opportunities when they arise and when we are confident that providing early financial support for the projects will lead to the award of the corresponding EPC contracts to us.\n(1) Amounts represent primarily service arrangements. Commitments pursuant to purchase orders and subcontracts related to construction contracts are not included as such amounts are expected to be funded under contract billings. We have no significant obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete contracts awarded to us.\nThe following table presents the determinations of EBITDA for Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively (amounts in thousands).\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) increased by $3.5 million, or 38%, to $13.0 million during Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $9.4 million for Fiscal 2017, as SMC was successful in increasing the revenues related to both outside and inside premises projects.\n\u00b7 GPS entered into three EPC services contracts to construct state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plants, having an aggregate power output of approximately 4.0 gigawatts.\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d and a series of amendments which together we identify as \u201cASC Topic 606\u201d. This new accounting standard, which we adopted on February 1, 2018 using the permitted modified retrospective method, outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. The new standard supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The effect of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on retained earnings as of February 1, 2018 was not material. The differences between our reported operating results for the year ended January 31, 2019, which reflect the application of the new standard on our contracts, and the results that would have been reported if the accounting was performed pursuant to the accounting standards previously in effect, also were not material.\nIn July 2018 and as discussed in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, TRC and PPS Engineers, Inc. (\u201cPPS\u201d) agreed to a settlement of all claims made against each other with TRC agreeing to make a payment to PPS in the amount of $0.9 million. As the total of previously accrued amounts exceeded the negotiated settlement amount, we recorded a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1.4 million that is included in other income for Fiscal 2019.", "item_7_text": "We have entered into similar support arrangements with other independent parties in the past that resulted in the successful development and construction of three separate gas-fired power plants. In each case, we deconsolidated the corresponding VIE when we were no longer the primary beneficiary.\nLegal Contingencies\nFor Fiscal 2017, we recorded income tax expense of $37.1 million resulting in an annual effective income tax rate of 32.4%. This annual rate differed from the expected federal income tax rate of 35.0% due to the favorable effect of the amounts of permanent differences for the year offset partially by the effect of state income taxes, net of federal income tax benefit, in the amount of $4.0 million. Most significantly, favorable permanent differences related to 1) the treatment of the excess income tax benefits associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2017, 2) the domestic production activities deduction and 3) the exclusion from taxable income of the income attributable to non-controlling interests which reduced income tax expense for Fiscal 2017 by $5.0 million, $2.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a \u201csafe harbor\u201d for certain forward-looking statements. We have made statements in this Item 7 and elsewhere in this 2019 Annual Report that may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements.\u201d The words \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cplan,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cforesee,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d or other similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effects on us. There can be no assurance that future developments affecting us will be those that we anticipate. All comments concerning our expectations for future revenues and operating results are based on our forecasts for our existing operations and do not include the potential impact of any future acquisitions. Our forward-looking statements, by their nature, involve significant risks and uncertainties (some of which are beyond our control) and assumptions. They are subject to change based upon various factors including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Item 1A of this 2019 Annual Report. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary in material respects from those projected in the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nEarnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\u201cEBITDA\u201d)\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\nGoodwill\nOther Income\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nN/M - Not meaningful.\nand solar fields is predicted to grow with accelerated pace in the near term boosted by extended tax credits. Nonetheless, as the demand for electrical power grows, natural gas is predicted to be a strong choice for new electricity generation plants in the future primarily due to favorable economics and the scheduled expiration of renewable energy tax credits.\nOur monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivables, and our non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property, plant, equipment goodwill and other purchased intangible assets, are not affected significantly by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of our building, improvements, equipment and furniture will not materially affect our operations.\n\nThe revenues of the power industry services business decreased by $446.7 million to $367.8 million for Fiscal 2019 compared with revenues of $814.5 million for the prior year, representing a decrease of 55% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 76% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, and approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for the prior year. The decrease in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the commissioning, start-up and final activities of four EPC projects, which represented $175.5 million, or 36%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019. All four of these projects reached substantial completion during Fiscal 2019.\nFrom time to time, we may arrange for bonding to be issued by our surety firm for the benefit of the owner of an energy project for which we are not providing construction services. We collect fees from the provider of such services as consideration for the use of our bonding capacity. As of January 31, 2019, the total amount of outstanding surety bonds issued under such arrangements was $11.1 million.\nWe must consolidate any VIE in which we have variable interests if we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the VIE; that is, if we have both (1) the power to direct the economically significant activities of the entity and (2) the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits from, the entity that could potentially be significant to the VIE. Such a determination requires management to evaluate circumstances and relationships and to make a significant judgment, and to repeat the evaluation at each subsequent reporting date. In the past, our evaluations have affirmed that, despite not having ownership interests in certain power plant development VIEs, GPS was the corresponding primary beneficiary due primarily to the significance of its loans to each entity, the risk that GPS could absorb significant losses if the development project was not successful, the opportunity for GPS to receive a development success fee and the commitment of the project developer in each case to award the large EPC contract for the construction of the power plant to GPS. As a result, the accounts of each VIE were included in our consolidated financial statements until project development efforts progressed on each one such that financial support was thereafter provided substantially by a pending investor. At this point in the life of each VIE, we deconsolidated it.\nThe new accounting for leases is not expected to have a material effect on our operating results in the future. Prior year financial statements will not be restated. We do intend to make the \u201cshort-term\u201d election, as permitted by the new standard, not to apply the new accounting to those leases with terms of twelve (12) months or less and that do not include options to purchase the underlying assets that we are reasonably certain to exercise. Our material operating leases, representing arrangements with initial lease terms greater than one year, primarily cover office and manufacturing facilities. We do not have any material finance leases as of February 1, 2019.\nAs indicated above, the revenues of TRC declined for Fiscal 2018 and it reported operating losses during Fiscal 2018. With the decreased results in Fiscal 2018 and a less favorable outlook for TRC, our business valuation performed at that time indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value. As a result, TRC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2018 of approximately $0.6 million.\nThe favorable effects of research and development credits and the reduction in the corporate income tax rate in the US, which partially offset the 44.8% decrease in the amount of gross profit, were the primary reasons that we experienced a limited decrease of 27.7% in net income attributable to our stockholders for Fiscal 2019 to $52.0 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, from $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, in the prior year.\nPower Industry Services\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) were $12.7 million for Fiscal 2019, compared with revenues of $13.0 million for the prior year as it nears completion of a large, multi-year, fiber-to-the-premises project for a municipal customer located in the state of Maryland.\nWe measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant-date fair value of stock option awards and we recognize the corresponding expense amounts over the vesting periods which were typically one year. However, starting in January 2018, stock option awards include three-year vesting periods. We expect that future awards will also vest over three years with one-third of the vesting occurring on each anniversary date of the corresponding award. Pursuant to our accounting, we will continue to record expense for the fair value of each stock option award ratably over the corresponding vesting period. Options to purchase 257,000, 301,500 and 270,000 shares of our common stock were awarded during Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, with weighted average fair value per share amounts of $9.31, $13.55 and $14.93, respectively. The amounts of compensation expense recorded during the corresponding years related to vesting stock options were $1.6 million, $4.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively. The decline in the expense amount for Fiscal 2019 reflects the longer vesting periods of recent stock option awards.\nAccordingly, the income tax benefits associated with research and development activities conducted in prior years in the total amount of $16.6 million have been recognized in income taxes for Fiscal 2019. The favorable effect of this amount on diluted earnings per share was $1.06 for the year.\nWe had financial control of construction joint ventures formed for the purpose of building two power plants, which were completed in Fiscal 2017 and for which the respective warranty periods have expired. The statutory partnerships representing the joint venture entities were dissolved during the year ended January 31, 2019. The accounts of the joint ventures were included in our consolidated financial statements during the periods of their existence.\nOn May 15, 2017, we entered into the Credit Agreement with the Bank as lender which replaced a predecessor agreement and modified its features to, among other things:\nOther unfavorable factors include challenging energy capacity auctions for new power generating assets, the impacts of environmental activism and California's resolve to move towards 100% renewable energy. The growth of vocal support for 100% renewable energy and the support of numerous environmental groups provided motivation for the release of the Green New Deal Resolution by progressive members of the US Congress. The fostered increase in the number of protests against a variety of fossil-fuel related energy projects continue to garner media attention and public skepticism about new fossil-fuel energy projects, particularly oil and natural gas pipelines, resulting in project delays due to onsite protest demonstrations, indecision by local officials and lawsuits. Pipeline approval delays may jeopardize projects that are needed to bring supplies of natural gas to potentially new gas-fired power plant sites, thereby increasing the risk of power plant project delays or cancellations.\nAs reported by EIA for 2018, net electricity generation at utility-scale facilities in the US rose by 3.6% from the prior year level as net generation from natural gas, wind and solar sources increased by 13.2%, 8.1% and 25.0%, respectively. Moreover, the share of net electricity generation fueled by natural gas rose from approximately 31.7% in 2017 to 34.4% for 2018. The net electricity generation from coal declined by 4.9% for the year. In summary, the share of the electrical power generation mix fueled by natural gas has continued its increase in the current year, while the share fueled by coal has continued its fall.\nThe reported amount of our project backlog at a point in time represents the total value of projects awarded to us that we consider to be firm as of that date less the amounts of revenues recognized to date on the corresponding contracts. Cancellations or reductions may occur that may reduce project backlog and our expected future revenues. Typically, we include the total value of an EPC service contract in project backlog when we receive a corresponding notice to proceed from the project owner. However, we may include the value of an EPC services contract prior to the receipt of a notice to proceed if we believe that it is probable that the project will commence within a reasonable timeframe, among other factors.\nThese costs were $41.8 million and $32.5 million for Fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively, representing approximately 4.7% and 4.8% of consolidated revenues for the corresponding years, respectively. Approximately $5.6 million of the increase between the years was due to an overall increase in salaries and incentive compensation costs driven by increased operations and project work, primarily at GPS and APC. In addition, stock option compensation expense increased by approximately $2.3 million between the years, primarily due to increased market prices of our common stock at the date that the majority of the corresponding stock options were granted. The remaining $1.4 million increase from Fiscal 2017 to Fiscal 2018 related to increased contributions to employee retirement plans, employee separation costs and other expenses partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense.\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment decreased by 17%, or $13.7 million, to $65.3 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $79.0 million for Fiscal 2017. The largest portion of TRC's revenues were provided by industrial field services. The decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to revenues included in Fiscal 2017 associated with large loss projects with former customers that were in-process on the date of our acquisition of TRC and which were primarily completed during that year.\nNet Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests\nDue primarily to the substantial increase in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, compared with consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also increased. These costs were $743.5 million and $528.3 million for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $149.3 million and $146.7 million, respectively. Our overall gross profit percentages of revenues were 16.7% and 21.7% for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, respectively. The decline in the percentage between years reflected the favorable achievement of contractual final completion of two natural gas-fired power plant projects during Fiscal 2017 which eliminated a number of significant risks and the related estimated costs associated with them, resulting in increased gross margins.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nThe revenues of the industrial fabrication and field services segment (representing the business of TRC) increased by 56%, or $36.4 million, to $101.7 million for Fiscal 2019 compared with revenues of $65.3 million for the prior year as business development efforts have succeeded in winning increased amounts of business from recurring as well as new customers. The largest portion of TRC's revenues continue to be provided by industrial field services and TRC's major customers include some of North America's largest forest products companies and fertilizer producers as well as energy and mining companies with plants located in the southeast region of the US.\nIn addition, GPS has been selected by project owners to provide EPC services in connection with the construction of several other power plant projects with projected start dates in Fiscal 2020. However, GPS has not completed contract negotiations nor received a full notice to proceed on any of these EPC projects, and there is always a possibility that one or more of these projects will not be built.\nWe believe that cash on hand, cash that will be provided from the maturities of short-term investments and cash generated from our future operations, with or without funds available under our line of credit, will be adequate to meet our general business needs in the foreseeable future. In particular, we maintain significant liquid capital on our balance sheet to help ensure our ability to maintain and obtain bonding capacity for current and future EPC and other construction projects. Any future acquisitions, or other significant unplanned cost or cash requirement, may require us to raise additional funds through the issuance of debt and/or equity securities. There can be no assurance that such financing will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, we completed a detailed review of the activities performed by our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits that may be available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, we identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that have not previously been recognized in our financial results for any prior year reporting period.\nThe Company includes the estimated amount of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized on the particular contract will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's determination of the amount of variable consideration to be included in the transaction price of a particular contract is based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available. The effect of any revisions to the transaction price on the amount of previously recognized revenues that is due to the addition or reduction of variable consideration is recorded currently as an adjustment to revenues on a cumulative catch-up basis. In the event that any amounts of variable consideration that are reflected in the transaction price of a contract are not resolved in the Company's favor, there could be reductions in, or reversals of, previously recognized revenues. In most significant instances, modifications to our contracts do not represent the addition of new performance obligations.\n\u00b7 add an accordion feature which allows for an additional commitment amount of $10.0 million, subject to certain conditions; and\nAs of January 31, 2019, we had approximately $15.2 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, primarily to support our APC activities. However, we had no outstanding borrowings. In addition, the commercial bank that has supported the activities of TRC issued an outstanding irrevocable letter of credit on its behalf in the amount of $0.4 million.\nAt the holding company level, we intend to make additional acquisitions of and/or investments in companies with significant potential for profitable growth. We may have more than one industrial focus. We expect that acquired companies will be held in separate subsidiaries that will be operated in a manner that best provides cash flows and value for our stockholders.\nThese estimates, judgments, and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and equity, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets, liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nEven though net income for the period, including the favorable adjustments related to non-cash expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $80.1 million, cash used in operations exceeded this amount primarily due to the effects of the four major EPC projects active during the year. Because these projects were well past the peak of their respective milestone billing schedules, we experienced a net decrease during Fiscal 2018 in the amount of billings on current projects in excess of corresponding costs and estimated earnings, which represented a use of cash in the amount of $102.5 million. The increase in project owner retainage amounts on active construction contracts represented a use of cash in the amount of $33.9 million. Other uses of cash included increased other assets of $4.6 million, primarily reflecting increased income tax payments, and decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses in the amount of $6.2 million, primarily reflecting the run-off of our warranty obligations related to power plants completed in prior years.\nImpairment Losses\nIn assessing whether deferred tax assets may be realizable, we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Our ability to realize our deferred tax assets, including those related to the net operating losses of TRC and APC that applicable income tax rules will allow us to use in order to offset future amounts of taxable income, depends primarily upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income to allow for the utilization of our deductible temporary differences. If such estimates and assumptions regarding income amounts change in the\n\u00b7 GPS reached substantial completion for four of its power plant projects.\n(2) Project activities were discontinued on March 7, 2019. At that time, the EPC project was nearly complete and first fire had been achieved on both of the power production units included in this gas-fired power plant (see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, included in Part I of this report for further information regarding this matter).\nFor Fiscal 2018 and 2017, this line item included interest income in the amounts of $5.1 million and $2.1 million, respectively, earned on CDs and $0.7 million and $0.2 million of additional investment income earned on funds maintained in a money market account, respectively. For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, the weighted average annual interest rates of the CDs owned during the corresponding years were 1.3% and 0.9%, respectively, and the weighted average income rates related to the money market investments were 0.8% and 0.3%, respectively. For Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, the weighted average initial terms-to-maturity of the CDs were 219 days and 166 days, respectively.\nFor example, GPS was in a dispute with a former subcontractor on one of its power plant construction projects that was settled pursuant to binding arbitration in June 2018. The arbitration panel awarded approximately $5.2 million, plus interest and arbitration fees, to the subcontractor. The substantial portion of the total amount, which was paid by GPS to the subcontractor in July 2018, was charged to cost of revenues. In connection with the settlement, the legal claims made by the parties against each other were dismissed with prejudice and without costs to the parties, all liens filed by the subcontractor related to the project were released, and each party provided the other with a release from future claims related to this matter.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe revenues of the power industry services business increased by $227.9 million to $814.5 million for Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $586.6 million for Fiscal 2017, representing an increase of 39% between years. The revenues of this business represented approximately 91% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018, and approximately 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2017. The increase in revenues for the power industry services segment primarily reflected the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of the four large natural gas-fired power plant construction projects, which represented $747.5 million, or 84%, of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2017, the combined revenues associated with these four projects, which were all in their earlier phases, represented $465.8 million, or 69%, of consolidated revenues. Construction activity related to two other natural-gas fired power plant projects that were completed in Fiscal 2017 represented 14% of consolidated revenues for that year. In addition, revenue for APC increased substantially during Fiscal 2018, primarily due to revenues of $12.2 million associated with the initial construction activity for two power plant projects in the UK.\n\nThe total annual amount of electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the US in 2018 was the highest amount generated since 2007. In its latest base-case outlook, the US Energy Information Administration (the \u201cEIA\u201d) forecasts steady growth in net electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of approximately 1.0% per year. The growth rate is tempered by new electricity-efficient devices and production processes replacing older, less-efficient appliances, heating, cooling and ventilation systems and capital equipment. Nonetheless, the EIA forecasts continued growth for natural gas-fired electricity generation through 2050 with average annual increases of 1.2% per year. EIA expects the share of total utility-scale electricity generation from natural gas-fired power plants in the US to rise from approximately 34% in 2018 to 37% in 2022 and to 39% by 2050. On the other hand, the generation share from coal is forecast to fall steadily during these periods, from 28% in 2018 to 23% in 2022 to 17% by 2050.\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations, and\nThe following discussion summarizes the financial position of Argan, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of January 31, 2019, and the results of their operations for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017, and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the \u201c2019 Annual Report\u201d).\nOur long-term contracts typically have schedule dates and other performance obligations that, if not achieved, could subject us to liquidated damages. These contract requirements generally relate to specified activities that must be completed by an established date or by achievement of a specified level of output or efficiency. Each contract defines the conditions under which a project owner may make a claim for liquidated damages. The amount of liquidated damages owed to a project owner pursuant to the terms of a contract would represent a reduction of the transaction price of the corresponding contract.\n\u00b7 We declared and paid regular quarterly cash dividends of $0.25, for a total of $1.00 during Fiscal 2019.\nOverview\nAs of November 1, 2018, we considered the significant excess of fair value over the carrying value of GPS that was quantitatively determined in the past, its history of strong financial performance, its future business prospects and various other business environment and market conditions. We believe that it was more likely than not that the fair value of the GPS reporting unit exceeded the corresponding carrying value as of November 1, 2018. Therefore, completion of the complicated quantitative impairment assessment was considered to be unnecessary as of November 1, 2018. No events associated with the business of GPS occurred in the period from the assessment date through January 31, 2019 that would cause us to reconsider that conclusion.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2019 and 2018\nDue primarily to the substantial decrease in consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, compared with consolidated revenues for the prior year, the corresponding consolidated cost of revenues also decreased. These costs were $399.7 million and $743.5 million for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, respectively. Gross profit amounts for the corresponding years were $82.4 million and $149.3 million, respectively.\n3. Determine the transaction price of the contract,\n\n\nThe following table presents our major power plant projects as of January 31, 2019:\nThe transaction price of a contract represents the value used to determine the amount of revenues recognized as of the balance sheet date. It may reflect amounts of variable consideration, which could be either increases or decreases to the transaction price. These adjustments can be made from time-to-time during the period of contract performance as circumstances evolve related to such items as variations in the scope and price of contracts, claims, incentives and liquidated damages.\nIncome Tax Expense\nCritical Accounting Policies\nDuring Fiscal 2018, we experienced labor and subcontractor costs that increased on certain now-completed projects to amounts greater than originally estimated. The corresponding increase in forecasted costs to complete these contracts and the associated reductions in the amount of forecasted gross margins resulted in reductions to the amount of consolidated gross profit reported last year.\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $52.0 million, or $3.32 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2019. For the prior year, we reported a comparable net income amount of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 (dollars in thousands).\nNotable accomplishments and other events for Fiscal 2019 included the following:\nFor Fiscal 2019 and 2018, this line item also includes interest income in the amounts of $4.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively, earned on certificate of deposit investments purchased from our bank (\u201cCDs\u201d) and $1.8 million and $0.7 million of additional investment income earned on funds maintained in a money market fund, respectively. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the weighted average annual interest rates of the CDs owned during the corresponding years were 2.0% and 1.3%, respectively, and the weighted average income rates related to the money market investments were 1.9% and 0.8%, respectively. For Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018, the weighted average initial terms-to-maturity of the CDs were 250 days and 219 days, respectively.\n\u00b7 increase the Bank's lending commitment amount from $10.0 million to $50.0 million including a revolving loan with interest at the 30-day LIBOR plus 2.0%;\nRevenue Recognition\n\u00b7 Both APC and TRC achieved record amounts of revenues during Fiscal 2019.\nAs a result, we continue to believe that the future prospects for natural gas-fired power plant construction are favorable as natural gas has become the primary source for power generation in our country. Major advances in horizontal drilling and the practice of hydraulic fracturing have led to the boom in natural gas supply which is available at consistently low prices now and in the foreseeable future. The abundant availability of cheap, less carbon-intense and higher efficiency natural gas should continue to be a significant factor in the economic assessment of future power generation capacity additions. As indicated above, the demand for electric power in this country is expected to grow slowly but steadily over the long term. Demands for electricity, the ample supply of natural gas, and the future retirement of coal, nuclear and inefficient gas-fired energy plants, should result in modern natural gas-fired energy plants representing a substantial portion of new power generation additions in the future and an increased share of the power generation mix. Moreover, the competitive landscape in the EPC services market for natural gas-fired power plant construction has changed significantly this year. Several significant competitors have announced that they are exiting the market for a variety of reasons. While the competitive market remains dynamic, we expect that there will be fewer competitors for new gas-fired power plant EPC project opportunities.\nThe net amount of cash used in operating activities during Fiscal 2019 was $112.3 million. Even though net income for the period, including the favorable adjustments related to non-cash income and expense items, provided cash in the total amount of $57.0 million, cash used in operations exceeded this amount. As discussed above, four major EPC projects achieved substantial completion in the current year, representing the primary driver for the use of cash by contracts-in-progress during the current year in the amount of $83.8 million. These projects were well past the peak of their respective milestone billing schedules. Due primarily to these projects, the amounts of billings in excess of the amounts of the corresponding costs and estimated earnings declined by $99.7 million during Fiscal 2019, which represented a substantial use of cash. Partially offsetting this effect, the Company collected amounts of billings previously retained by project owners which provided $48.7 million in cash during the period.\n(4) A limited notice to proceed with certain preliminary design and site preparation activities was issued to GPS in January 2019. We expect to receive FNTP in the spring of 2019.\nAs described in Note 6 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, our loss experience related to uncollectible amounts billed to customers has not been significant in the past. However, there is collection risk related to accounts receivable and retainage amounts due from the customer involved in the dispute discussed above. We believe that the underlying invoices were prepared and submitted to the customer pursuant to the terms of the contract, but the customer has not paid them when due. The last payment received from the customer was in January 2019. We believe that we are entitled to receive payments for these billings and we are confident that payments will be made. However, the collection time for these amounts, approximately $17.1 million in total, may be extended substantially and could depend on the resolution of the outstanding legal matter.\n\u00b7 extend the maturity date three years from May 31, 2018 to May 31, 2021.\nOther Income\nIn August 2018, the administration of President Trump moved to formally replace the Clean Power Plan, an environmental regulation intended by the prior administration to be the single-most important step America has ever taken to fight climate change. The new proposal, called the Affordable Clean Energy Rule, would be more favorable to the coal industry by allowing individual states greater authority to make their own plans for regulating greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired power plants. However, even without the regulation, the US has seen a decline in carbon dioxide emissions from power plants as the supply of inexpensive natural gas and the growth in renewable energy have moved more energy providers away from coal. In addition, the coal-fired power plant fleet is generally old. It is expensive to keep the coal plants running, and they are not competitive in the market. Nevertheless, in some cases, the new plan may encourage the continued operation of old coal plants that might otherwise be retired without any government intervention.\nWith the assistance of a professional business valuation firm, we also performed a full assessment of the fair value of APC as of November 1, 2018. The result concluded that no additional impairment of goodwill had occurred as the operating results and business prospects of APC continue to improve. We believe that the financial forecast for APC that we prepared and that was used in this valuation fairly reflected the effects that Brexit and suspended electricity generation capacity payments may have on our business. In our opinion, no events related to APC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 that would cause us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nIn certain situations, we use a simplified approach which allows us to first assess qualitative factors to decide whether it is necessary to perform the more complex quantitative goodwill impairment test. We are not required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless we determine, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than the corresponding carrying value. The professional guidance includes discussions of the types of factors which should be considered in conducting the qualitative assessment including macroeconomic, industry, market and entity-specific factors.\nThe primary source of cash required to fund operations during Fiscal 2019 was the net maturity of short-term investments (CDs purchased from our Bank) in the amount of $179.0 million. Non-operating activities used cash during the current year, including primarily the payment of four quarterly cash dividends in the total amount of $15.6 million. Our operating subsidiaries also used cash during Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $8.6 million to fund capital expenditures. As of January 31, 2019, there were no restrictions with respect to inter-company payments from GPS, TRC, APC or SMC to the holding company.\nThrough GPS and APC, which together provided 76%, 91% and 87% of consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, we provide a full range of engineering, procurement, construction, commissioning, operations management, maintenance, project development, technical and consulting services to the power generation and renewable energy markets. The wide range of customers includes independent power producers, public utilities, power plant equipment suppliers and global energy plant construction firms. Including consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities (\u201cVIEs\u201d), GPS and APC represent our power industry services reportable segment. Through TRC, the industrial fabrication and field services reportable segment provides on-site services that support maintenance turnarounds, shutdowns and emergency mobilizations for industrial plants primarily located in the southern region of the US and that are based on its expertise in producing, delivering and installing fabricated steel components such as piping systems, pressure vessels and heat exchangers. Through SMC, which conducts business as SMC Infrastructure Solutions, the telecommunications infrastructure services segment provides project management, construction, installation and maintenance services to commercial, local government and federal government customers primarily in the mid-Atlantic region of the US.\nIn the ordinary course of business, our customers may request that we obtain surety bonds in connection with construction contract performance obligations that are not required to be recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. We would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of our surety bonds for any payments made. Each of our commitments under performance bonds generally ends concurrently with the expiration of the related contractual obligation. We have a line of credit committed by the Bank in the amount of $50.0 million for general purposes. We may also use the borrowing ability to cover standby letters of credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business. As of January 31, 2019, we had approximately $15.2 million of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement, but no borrowings.\n(1) Full Notice-to-Proceed (\u201cFNTP\u201d) represents the formal notice provided by the customer instructing us to commence all of the activities covered by the corresponding contract.\nHowever, the Company's overall gross profit percentage of 17.1% of consolidated revenues was higher for Fiscal 2019 compared to a percentage of 16.7% for Fiscal 2018, which was due to an improvement in the gross profit percentage of the power industry services segment. As indicated above, the results for the year were primarily driven by execution on the commissioning, start-up and final phases of four natural gas-fired power plant projects, all of which have reached substantial completion. These achievements resulted in our making favorable project close-out adjustments to the gross profits of certain large projects. Unfavorable gross profit adjustments on certain smaller projects active at year-end partially offset the impacts of the favorable project closeouts. These projects have experienced cost increases due to a number of factors, including the identification of certain areas where estimated cost assumptions were too optimistic and the encounter of unforeseen construction, labor, weather, subcontractor, contractual and owner challenges as well as other performance difficulties that may continue to impact our operating results until the projects reach completion.\nAt January 31, 2019, most of our balance of cash and cash equivalents was invested in a high-quality money market fund with at least 99.5% of its total assets invested in cash, U.S. Treasury obligations and repurchase agreements secured by US Treasury obligations. Most of our domestic operating bank accounts are maintained with the Bank. We do maintain certain Euro-based bank accounts in the Republic of Ireland, certain pound sterling-based bank accounts in the UK and insignificant bank accounts in other countries in support of the operations of APC.\nIndustrial Fabrication and Field Services\n\u00b7 We maintained overall profitability levels as consolidated gross profit and net income attributable to our stockholders, expressed as percentages of consolidated revenues, were 17.1% and 10.8%, respectively.\nWe enter into EPC and other long-term construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids or in conjunction with our support of the development of power plant projects. The types of contracts may vary. However, the EPC contracts of our power industry services reporting segment, and most other large contracts awarded to our other companies, are fixed-price contracts. Revenues are recognized primarily over time as performance obligations are satisfied due to the continuous transfer of control to the project owner or other customer.\nOur primary source of this cash during Fiscal 2018 was the net maturity of short-term investments in the amount of $45.0 million. In addition, the exercise of options to purchase 109,500 shares of our common stock provided us with cash proceeds in the approximate amount of $3.2 million. Non-operating activity cash uses included primarily the payment of a cash dividend of $15.5 million. During Fiscal 2018, we also used cash as our consolidated joint ventures made distributions to our joint venture partner in the total amount of $1.2 million. Our operating subsidiaries used cash during Fiscal 2018 in the amount of $4.8 million for capital expenditures and GPS funded $1.5 million in development loans to various power facility project development entities.\nAs disclosed in the \u201cResearch and Development Tax Credits\u201d section of Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, during Fiscal 2019 we completed a detailed review of the activities of our engineering staff on major EPC services projects in order to identify and quantify the amounts of research and development credits available to reduce prior year income taxes. This study focused on project costs incurred during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018. Based on the results of the study, we identified and estimated significant amounts of income tax benefits that were not previously recognized in our financial results for any prior year reporting period. In the determination of the amount of such benefits to recognize, we have been required to apply the professional accounting guidance related to meaningful uncertain income tax positions for the first time.\n\u00b7 After a lengthy and extensive study, we recorded income tax credit benefits associated with increasing research and development activities in our financial results for Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $16.6 million.\nAt the outset of each of the Company's contracts, the potential amounts of liquidated damages typically are not constrained, or subtracted, from the transaction price as the Company believes that it has included activities in its contract plan, and has reflected the associated costs in its forecasts of completed contract costs, that will be effective in preventing such damages. Of course, circumstances may change as the Company executes the corresponding contract. The transaction price is reduced by an applicable amount when the Company no longer considers it probable that a future reversal of revenues will not occur when the matter is resolved. In general, we consider potential liquidated damages, the costs of other related items and potential mitigating factors in determining the estimates of forecasted revenues and the adequacy of our estimates of completed contract costs.\nAs discussed above, we recorded an income tax benefit for Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $4.7 million which reflected the amount of the benefit associated with research and development credits generated during the three-year period ended January 31, 2018 in the amount of $16.6 million that we recorded during the current year.\nWe maintain a variety of commercial commitments that are generally made available to provide support for various commercial provisions in the engineering, procurement and construction contracts. For certain projects, we are required by project owners to provide guarantees related to our services or work. If our services under a guaranteed project would not be completed or would be determined to have resulted in a material defect or other material deficiency, then we may be responsible for monetary damages or other legal remedies. When sufficient information about claims on guaranteed projects would be available and monetary damages or other costs or losses would be determined to be probable, we would record such guaranteed losses.\nAlthough we believe that the projected financial results are reasonable considering the improved operating results achieved by TRC for the nine months ended October 31, 2018 and the current business prospects, any future results that would compare unfavorably with the projected results could result in additional material goodwill impairment losses. Further, unless TRC demonstates that it can contribute strong operating results that would justify favorable modifications to certain profitability assumptions, thereby supporting an increased fair value of the business in the future, additional goodwill impairment losses may occur. No events related to TRC occurred during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2019 that caused us to perform a subsequent impairment assessment.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nThe gross profit percentage for Fiscal 2018 primarily reflected execution on the ramped-up, peak and post-peak construction activities of four natural gas-fired power plant projects of GPS. However, during Fiscal 2018, certain of the natural gas-fired power plant projects had experienced meaningful increased labor and subcontractor costs to amounts greater than originally estimated. The increases in forecasted costs to complete these contracts and the corresponding reductions in the amounts of forecasted gross margins resulted in a reduction to consolidated gross profit being recognized during the latter half of Fiscal 2018. The gross profit percentage increased at APC and SMC and decreased at TRC, resulting in a net aggregate gross profit percent decrease of 1.0% of the combined revenues of the non-GPS entities between the years.\nWe reported net income attributable to our stockholders of $72.0 million, or $4.56 per diluted share, for Fiscal 2018. For Fiscal 2017, we reported a comparable net income amount of $70.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share. The following schedule compares our operating results for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (dollars in thousands).\nOn the other hand, the final outcome of a legal matter may result in the reversal of accrued liabilities established in prior periods. In February 2016, as disclosed in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, TRC was sued by PPS, a former subcontractor, in an attempt to force TRC to pay invoices for services rendered in the total amount of $2.3 million. In addition, PPS placed liens on the property of customers in several states where work was performed by PPS and it also filed a claim against the bond issued on behalf of TRC relating to one significant project. TRC filed responses asserting that PPS failed to deliver a number of items required by the applicable contract between the parties, that the invoices rendered by PPS covering the disputed services would not be paid until such deliverables were supplied, and that certain sums were owed to it by PPS for services, furniture, fixtures, equipment, and software that were supplied by TRC on behalf of PPS. The amounts invoiced by PPS were accrued by TRC and the corresponding liability amounts were included in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet as January 31, 2018. TRC did not record an account receivable for the amounts it believed were owed to it by PPS. A mediation effort was attempted in 2016 but it was unproductive in resolving the disputes. In July 2018, the parties agreed to a settlement of all claims made against each other with TRC agreeing to make a payment to PPS in the amount of $0.9 million. As the total of the previously accrued amounts exceeded the negotiated settlement amount, the Company recorded a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1.4 million that was included in other income for Fiscal 2019.\nWe consider ourselves to be the primary beneficiary of a VIE formed last year by an independent firm for the purpose of developing a natural gas-fired power plant. Pursuant to agreements negotiated with the developer, we are lending funds to the VIE to cover certain costs of the project development effort. The development phase activities of the VIE are focused on 1) obtaining the necessary permits to build and operate the power plant, 2) completing arrangements to connect the power plant to the fuel supply and the electricity grid, 3) engaging energy plant operators in negotiations for the purchase of project ownership interests, and 4) securing permanent financing for the project, with financial closing expected to occur during calendar year 2019. As we are the primary beneficiary of this VIE during the development phase, it is included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019.\nImpairment Losses\n1. Identify the contract,\nIn 2016, the FASB also issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The scope of this new standard covers, among other provisions, the methods that businesses shall use to estimate amounts of uncollectible accounts receivable. As subsequently amended, we do not expect that the requirements of this new guidance, which becomes effective for us on February 1, 2020, will materially effect our consolidated financial statements.\nDuring Fiscal 2018, our combined balance of cash and cash equivalents decreased by $45.1 million to $122.1 million as of January 31, 2018 from a balance of $167.2 million as of January 31, 2017. During this same year, our working capital increased by $64.6 million to $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018 from $237.2 million as of January 31, 2017.\nIn January 2019, GPS sued Exelon for breach of contract and failure to remedy various events which negatively impacted the schedule and costs of the Exelon West Medway II Facility resulting in Exelon receiving the benefits of GPS's work without making payment for the value. On March 7, 2019, Exelon notified us of its termination of the EPC services contract with GPS on the Exelon West Medway II Facility. At that time, the project was nearly complete and all units had reached first fire. Exelon has also asserted various claims against us and has withheld payments of billed amounts owed to us. GPS will vigorously assert its rights and claims to recover its lost value and to collect any remaining monies owed.\nImpairment losses were recorded during Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018 related to the goodwill of TRC in the amounts of $1.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. The business valuations, which were performed for each year based on a blend of results determined by several income and market approaches, indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value at each testing date. Drivers for the impairment loss recorded in Fiscal 2019 included the increased carrying value of the business (reflecting the improved operating results for the current year), increased working capital requirements, reduced profit margins and appropriate changes to certain statistical factors. For Fiscal 2018, the impairment loss related primarily to the use of forecasted financial results which presented a less favorable outlook for TRC at that time than in prior years reflecting a trend of actual revenues below previous expectations and operating losses incurred during the year.\n(3) A FNTP has not been received and the scheduled completion date has not been established definitively as of January 31, 2019.\nAt January 31, 2019, the goodwill balances related to the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC were $18.5 million, $12.3 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which together represented approximately 7% of consolidated total assets. The Company performs its required annual assessments of the carrying value of goodwill as of November 1 each year. We also test for impairment of goodwill more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill might be impaired.\n\u00b7 The adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard resulted in an immaterial change to our retained earnings and minimal changes to our ongoing revenue recognition.\nfuture, we may be required to record valuation allowances against some or all of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of earnings. At this time, we believe that the historically strong earnings performance of our power industry services segment and the strengthening business of APC will provide sufficient income during the periods when the deferred tax assets become deductible to utilize the applicable temporary income tax differences. Accordingly, we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of significantly all of our deferred tax assets.\nOur consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019 included deferred tax assets in the amount of $1.3 million. The components of our deferred tax amounts are presented in Note 13 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. These amounts reflect differences in the periods in which certain transactions are recognized for financial and income tax reporting purposes.\nHowever, as EBITDA is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with US GAAP, we do not believe that this measure should be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the results of our operations presented in accordance with US GAAP that are included in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our EBITDA does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.\nAs is common in our industry, EPC contractors execute certain contracts jointly with third parties through joint ventures, limited partnerships and limited liability companies for the purpose of executing a project or program for a project owner. These teaming arrangements are generally dissolved upon completion of the project or program. In addition, as discussed previously, we may obtain interests in VIEs formed by its owners for a specific purpose.\nTelecommunications Infrastructure Services\nAccounts Receivables and Contract Assets\nUnder this guidance, income tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. Fiscal 2019 is the initial reporting period in which we had sufficient data on which to make an evaluation and to reach a conclusion on the amount of income tax credit benefits related to prior year project costs that, more likely than not, qualified as research and development costs under the IRC and the rules and regulations of certain states. The net amount of the credits that we recognized in income taxes during Fiscal 2019 was $16.6 million. Based on our judgement, the amount of income tax benefits related to identified research and development income tax credits that we have assessed as not meeting the threshold criteria for recognition was $5.1 million, for which we have established a liability related to uncertain income tax return positions that is included in accrued expenses as of January 31, 2019.\nAt January 31, 2019 and 2018, our balances of cash and cash equivalents were $164.3 million and $122.1 million, respectively. During this same period, our working capital increased by $32.3 million to $334.1 million as of January 31, 2019 from $301.8 million as of January 31, 2018.\nWe do become involved in legal matters where litigation has been initiated or claims have been made against us. At this time, we do not believe that any additional material loss is probable related to any of the current matters discussed herein. However, we do maintain accrued expense balances for the estimated amounts of legal costs expected to be billed related to each matter. We review the status of each matter and assess the adequacy of the accrued expense balances at the end of each fiscal quarter, and make adjustments to the balances if necessary. Should our assessments of the outcomes of these legal matters change, significant losses or additional costs may be recorded.\nStock Options\nRevenues\nMarket Outlook\nContractual obligations outstanding as of January 31, 2019 are summarized below (dollars in thousands):\nDeferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nWe do procure steel and other commodities for use in our construction projects. These materials can be subject to significant price fluctuations. For example, raw steel prices increased sharply at the beginning of calendar 2018, driven by a bullish market in commodities and industrial metals, as well as by import tariffs imposed by the US. During most of 2018, domestic steel prices remained at seven-year highs. However, steel prices have showed slower momentum recently and current domestic steel prices appear in a downtrend. On the other hand, the well-publicized shortage of skilled construction workers has been accompanied recently by corresponding wage increases at rates higher than those experienced since the recession in 2007. We strive to include the anticipated increases in the prices of equipment and commodity materials and the expected rise in labor rates as we estimate costs and prepare prices associated with bidding for new work. Although we have not been adversely affected by price fluctuations and wage increases to any significant extent in the past, there is no assurance that we will not be in the future.\nLast year, the combined revenues associated with the four gas-fired power plant projects, which were in peak and post-peak construction activity stages, represented approximately 84% of consolidated revenues for the year. Three other power plant projects reached peak construction activities during Fiscal 2019 including two projects located in the UK which are scheduled for completion in Fiscal 2020. They represented 33% of consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2019 compared to 5% of consolidated revenues during Fiscal 2018.\nIn accordance with current accounting guidance, we perform testing for the impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with the carrying amount of the unit reflected in the consolidated financial statements, including goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the excess, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWe reported in previous filings that we expected the revenues of GPS to decrease significantly in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018, which they did. We anticipate adding new EPC services contracts to our growing project backlog and beginning work on the new projects in the first half of the year ending January 31, 2020 (\u201cFiscal 2020\u201d) as discussed below. However, it takes time for us to ramp-up meaningful revenues associated with new EPC projects due to the timing of when we receive full notices to proceed with all construction efforts and the overall project life-cycles of gas-fired power plants. Therefore, we expect to continue to report reduced consolidated revenues for the first half of Fiscal 2020 as we begin preliminary design and site preparation activities and prepare for the early stages of expected new projects. We are optimistic that we will see a resumption of year-to-year growth for the entire Company as new EPC service projects of GPS mature. Additional new EPC service project opportunities exist and, as reported in previous filings, negotiations continue with project owners for several new projects. Project backlog was approximately $1.1 billion as of January 31, 2019 compared with $0.4 billion as of January 31, 2018.\nAs presented above, the operations of TRC and APC have experienced meaningful growth in revenues this year. As expected, the increase in the level of business resulted in an increase in the amount of working capital required to support the growth. Accordingly, the amounts of costs incurred and estimated earnings recognized on certain active projects in excess of the amounts billed on those projects rose during Fiscal 2019 in the amount of $33.8 million, which represents a use of cash. Similarly, due in part to increased activity at these operating subsidiaries, accounts receivable increased during Fiscal 2019, a use of cash in the amount of $10.2 million. The Company also used cash in the amount of $60.2 million to reduce the level of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. Due primarily to the inclusion of expected income tax refunds, the balance of other assets increased by $15.2 million during Fiscal 2019, representing a use of cash.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of stock options. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computations, which are disclosed in Note 12 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and include the risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, the expected volatility of the market price of our common stock and the expected life of each stock option. Changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of stock option awards. We believe that our stock option exercise activity has become sufficient to provide us with a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected lives. Accordingly, the estimated expected life used in the determination of the fair value of each stock option awarded since January 2017 is approximately 3.3 years. The use of longer estimated expected lives in our calculations would result in higher fair value amounts per share.\nCost of Revenues\nInflation\nAs construction activity on four large natural gas-fired power plants wound down during the current year, our consolidated revenues for Fiscal 2019 declined to $482.2 million from $892.8 million for Fiscal 2018 when the construction activity on all of these projects were at peak or near-peak levels. However, we are encouraged by the growth in the revenues of our other operating units (TRC, APC and SMC) which more than doubled in Fiscal 2019 compared to Fiscal 2018. Our gross profit for Fiscal 2019 was $82.4 million compared with $149.3 million for Fiscal 2018, reflecting primarily the reduction in consolidated revenues between periods. However, our gross margin percentage increased to 17.1% for Fiscal 2019 from 16.7% for the prior year.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, GPS entered into three EPC services contracts to construct state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plants, having an aggregate power output of approximately 4.0 gigawatts. In addition to the Reidsville Energy Center and the Guernsey Power Station, which are included in the table presented above and reflected in our project backlog as of January 31, 2019, GPS has entered into an EPC services contract to construct the Chickahominy Power Station, a 1,600 MW natural gas-fired power plant, in Charles City County, Virginia. Even though we are providing financial and technical support to the project development effort through a consolidated VIE, we have not included the value of this contract in our project backlog.\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nOver the next three years, EIA forecasts that 72 gigawatts of new wind and photovoltaic solar capacity will be added in the US attributable to declining equipment costs and the availability of valuable tax credits. As these credits decline and then expire early in the next decade, the wind capacity additions will slow. Although tax incentives related to solar power also expire, the continuing decline in the cost of solar power equipment is predicted to sustain the growth of photovoltaic solar power generation facilities. However, persistent low natural gas prices, lower power plant operating costs and higher energy generating efficiencies should sustain the demand for modern combined cycle gas-fired power plants in the future. As a result, the long-term trends in electricity generation through 2050 are dominated by natural gas-fired and solar capacity additions.\nBusiness Description\nFor Fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $40.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 35.8%. The annual income tax rate was higher than our blended federal income tax rate of 33.8% for Fiscal 2018 due primarily to the $5.0 million unfavorable effect of state income taxes, offset partially by the favorable $3.2 million effect of the domestic production activities deduction and by the excess income tax benefit associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2018 with a favorable effect of $0.9 million. The latter benefit declined significantly between years as the volume of stock option exercises decreased in Fiscal 2018. In Fiscal 2017, we also obtained substantial benefit from the exclusion of income attributable to the non-controlling interests in joint ventures which were consolidated for financial reporting purposes (see the next paragraph); for Fiscal 2018, the income tax benefit of the exclusion was only $0.1 million due to the substantial wind-up of activities by the joint ventures at that time. In addition, as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the Company revalued its deferred taxes as of December 22, 2017 and recognized an income tax benefit of $0.8 million for Fiscal 2018.\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward Looking Statements\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nContractual Obligations\n5. Recognize revenue.\nWe have pledged the majority of our assets to secure the financing arrangements. The Bank's consent is not required for acquisitions, divestitures, cash dividends or significant investments as long as certain conditions are met. The Bank will continue to require that we comply with certain financial covenants at our fiscal year-end and at each fiscal quarter-end. The Credit Agreement includes other terms, covenants and events of default that are customary for a credit facility of its size and nature. At January 31, 2019 and 2018, we were compliant with the financial covenants of the Credit Agreement. We may use the borrowing ability to cover other credit issued by the Bank for our use in the ordinary course of business.\nAs required by current accounting requirements, we performed a goodwill impairment assessment for TRC as of November 1, 2018, using the assistance of a professional business valuation firm. Although it was determined that the fair value of TRC was approximately the same value as determined as of November 1, 2017, the current year amount was less than the corresponding carrying value and we recorded a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million that is included in the consolidated statement of earnings for Fiscal 2019. Last year, a smaller goodwill impairment loss in the amount of $0.6 million was recorded. The remaining balance of goodwill for TRC that is reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019, after reduction for impairment losses, was $12.3 million.\nIn Fiscal 2017, the revenues of APC declined and it reported operating losses. In July 2016, work was suspended on APC's largest project at the time, which represented over 90% of APC's project backlog. Additionally, the pound sterling drop, financial market uncertainty and recessionary pressures related to Brexit were thought to likely impact the availability of financing for future power plant developments. Given these circumstances, analyses were performed mid-year in order to determine whether an impairment loss related to goodwill had been incurred. Using income and market approaches, the assessment analysis indicated that the carrying value of the business exceeded its fair value at that time. As a result, APC recorded an impairment loss during Fiscal 2017 of approximately $2.0 million.\nCentral to the new revenue recognition guidance is a five-step revenue recognition model that requires reporting entities to:\nPower Industry Services\nThese costs were $40.7 million and $41.8 million for Fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively, representing a 3% decrease between the years. Stock compensation expense decreased by approximately $3.0 million between the years, primarily due to increased vesting periods associated with new stock option awards and incentive compensation decreased by $2.7 million, reflecting the reduced operations at GPS. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased non-chargeable staff costs and professional services costs.\nOver the last few years, our ability to run our business in a manner that provides consistent financial results has been unfavorably impacted by the lengthening time between the conception of a power plant project and the commencement of construction activities. We believe that the resulting delays in new business awards to GPS relates, in part, to the soft demand for electricity, especially in the northeast and mid-Atlantic regions of the US. In addition, as explained below, there is uncertainty surrounding the level of regulatory support for coal as part of the energy mix, an increase in the amount of power generating capacity provided by renewable energy assets and increasing interest in renewable energy storage solutions. Together with the difficulties experienced by project developers in obtaining project financing, these factors may be impacting the planning and initiation phases for the construction of new natural gas-fired power plants which continue to be deferred by project owners.\nWe believe that EBITDA, a non-US GAAP financial measurement, is a meaningful presentation that enables us to assess and compare our operating cash flow performance on a consistent basis by removing from our operating results the impacts of our capital structure, the effects of the accounting methods used to compute depreciation and amortization and the effects of operating in different income tax jurisdictions. Further, we believe that EBITDA is widely used by investors and analysts as a measure of performance.\nResearch and Development Credits\nIncome Tax Benefit (Expense)\nDescriptions of the Company's significant accounting policies, including those discussed below, are included in Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended January 31, 2019. We consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition on long-term construction contracts; income tax reporting; the accounting for business combinations; the subsequent valuation of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets; the valuation of employee stock options; and the financial reporting associated with any significant claims or legal matters to be most critical to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations, as well as the accounting and reporting for special purpose entities including joint ventures and variable interest entities. Critical accounting policies are those related to the areas where we have made what we consider to be particularly subjective or complex judgments in arriving at estimates and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions.\nCurrently, we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE that is performing project development activities for the construction of a new natural gas-fired power plant. Consideration for the engineering and financial support being provided to the entity by GPS included the right to negotiate the corresponding turnkey EPC contract for the project. The account balances of the VIE were included in our consolidated financial statements as of January 31, 2019 and 2018.\nActual costs may vary from the costs we estimate. Variations from estimated contract costs, along with other risks inherent in fixed-price contracts, may result in actual revenues and gross profits differing from those we estimate and could result in losses on projects or other significant unfavorable impacts on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year. If a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract, the projected loss is recognized in full when determined, without regard to the percentage of completion. We believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts at each company going forward is limited by our management's experience in estimating contract costs and in making early identification of unfavorable variances as work progresses.\nVariable Interest Entities\n2. Identify the performance obligations of the contract,\nArgan is a holding company that conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, GPS, APC, SMC and TRC.\nThe Tax Act, which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, significantly changed tax law in the US by, among other changes, reducing the federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% (effective January 1, 2018). As expected, our annual effective income tax rate for Fiscal 2019, before the benefits of the research and development credits discussed above and a favorable net operating loss carryforward adjustment, decreased meaningfully to 29.5% from the comparable effective tax rate for Fiscal 2018 of 35.8%, primarily due to the lower statutory tax rate. However, certain modifications of the Tax Act negatively impacted our effective rate, including the elimination of the domestic production activities deduction, the expansion of the limitation on the deductibility of certain meals and entertainment expenses and additional limits on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. The effective tax rate of 29.5% is higher than the new federal income tax rate of 21% due primarily to the unfavorable effect of state income taxes.\nThere are no other recently issued accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted that we consider material to our consolidated financial statements.\nGPS and APC are completing certain projects that are confronting significant operational and contractual challenges, and our operating results for Fiscal 2019 reflect unfavorable gross profit adjustments on these jobs which are both behind the schedules originally established for these jobs. These projects may continue to impact our operating results negatively until they reach completion.\nIn connection with the acquisitions of GPS, TRC and APC, we recorded substantial amounts of goodwill and other purchased intangible assets including contractual and other customer relationships, non-compete agreements, trade names and certain fabrication process certifications. We utilized the assistance of a professional appraisal firm in the initial determinations of goodwill and the other purchased intangible assets for these acquisitions. Other than goodwill, most of our purchased intangible assets were determined to have finite useful lives.\nRevenues from fixed price contracts, including a portion of estimated profit, are recognized over time, based on costs incurred and estimated total contract costs using the percentage-of-completion method. The cost and profit estimates are determined at least quarterly for all significant contracts pursuant to a detailed process. The results of the process are subjected to reviews by senior management at each subsidiary. The percentage-of-completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion. This requires us to prepare on-going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses. In preparing these estimates, we make significant judgments and assumptions about our significant costs, including materials, labor and equipment, and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances, production delays or other productivity factors. Meaningful costs incurred on a particular contract that are related to materials or equipment items over which the corresponding project owner has yet to obtain control are excluded from the measurement of progress toward the satisfaction of the corresponding performance obligation determined as of the report date. As a result, the revenues recognized on the corresponding project are reduced.\nCost of Revenues\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of January 31, 2019 and 2018\nThe new guidance focuses on the transfer of the contractor's control of the goods and/or services to the customer, as opposed to the transfer of risk and rewards. Major provisions cover the determination of which goods and services are distinct and represent separate performance obligations, the appropriate treatment of variable consideration, and the evaluation of whether revenues should be recognized at a point in time or over time. Application of the new rules requires us to make important judgements and meaningful estimates that may have significant impact on the amounts of revenues recognized by us for a reporting period.\nFor Fiscal 2018, we recorded income tax expense of $40.3 million reflecting an annual effective income tax rate of approximately 35.8% as stated above. The annual income tax rate was higher than the blended federal income tax rate of 33.8% for Fiscal 2018 due primarily to the $5.0 million unfavorable effect of state income taxes, offset partially by the favorable $3.2 million effect of the domestic production activities deduction and by the excess income tax benefit associated with stock options exercised during Fiscal 2018 with a favorable effect of $0.9 million. In addition, as a result of the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, we revalued deferred taxes as of December 22, 2017 and recognized an income tax benefit of $0.8 million in Fiscal 2018.\n\nCrucial to the compliance with the new standard for revenue recognition is the identification of the promises made to the customer by us that are included in the contract. If a promise is distinct, as that concept is defined in the new standard, it represents a separate performance obligation. Contracts may have multiple performance obligations. The amounts of revenue associated with each promise are recognized when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied. However, complex contracts may include only one performance obligation if the multiple promises are not distinct within the context of the contract. For example, if the promises that could be considered distinct are interrelated or require us to perform integration so that the customer receives a complete product, the contract is considered to include only one performance obligation. Most of our long-term contracts have a single performance obligation as the promises to transfer individual goods or services are not separately identifiable from other promises within the context of the contract. Our EPC contracts require us to deliver a complete and functioning power plant, not just functioning components.\nComparison of the Results of Operations for the Years Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017\nUnpriced change orders, which represent contract variations for which we have project owner directive for additional work or authorization for scope changes but not for the price associated with the corresponding change, are included in the value of a contract, or the transaction price, when it is probable that the applicable costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price. Amounts of identified change orders that are not yet considered probable as of the corresponding balance sheet date are excluded from the transaction price. Actual costs related to change orders are expensed as they are incurred. Contract results may be impacted by estimates of the amounts of contract variations that we expect to receive. The effects of any resulting revisions to revenues and estimated costs can be determined at any time and they could be material. As of January 31, 2019, the aggregate amount of unpriced change orders reflected in estimated transaction prices was $18.8 million. In general, contract variations that are unapproved in regard to both scope and price are included in the transaction price of a contract and consequently reflected in revenues only when an agreement on the amount has been reached with the project owner.\nAs we believe that our net cash flow provided by or used in operations is the most directly comparable performance measure determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the US (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d), the following table reconciles the amounts of EBITDA for the applicable periods, as presented above, to the corresponding amounts of net cash flows (used in) provided by operating activities that are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows for Fiscal 2019, Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 (amounts in thousands).\n\nRevenues\nIn summary, the development of natural gas-fired power generation facilities in the US should continue to provide new construction opportunities for us, although the pace of new opportunities emerging may be restrained in the near term as discussed above. We are committed to the rational pursuit of new construction projects and the future growth of our revenues. This may result in our decision to make investments in the development and/or ownership of new projects. Because we believe in the strength of our balance sheet, we are willing to consider certain opportunities that include reasonable and manageable risks in order to assure the award of the related EPC services contract to us. We believe that the Company has a growing reputation as an accomplished and cost-effective provider of EPC and other large project construction contracting services in the US, the UK and Ireland. With the proven ability to deliver completed power facilities, particularly combined cycle, natural gas-fired power plants, we are focused on expanding our position in the power markets where we expect investments to be made based on forecasts of electricity demand covering decades into the future. We believe that our expectations are valid and that our plans for the future continue to be based on reasonable assumptions.\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, we entered separate construction joint ventures related to two natural gas-fired power plant projects. Because we had financial control at that time, the joint ventures were included in our consolidated financial statements. Our joint venture partner's share of the earnings is reflected in the line item captioned net income attributable to non-controlling interests included in the accompanying statements of earnings for Fiscal 2018 and Fiscal 2017 in the amounts of $0.3 million and $7.1 million, respectively. The reduction in the amount between years primarily reflected the contractual completion of the projects in Fiscal 2017, with the provision of warranty services being the primary remaining obligations of the joint ventures in Fiscal 2018.\nGoodwill Impairment\nIncome tax positions must meet a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold to be recognized. Income tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met. We consider Fiscal 2019 as the initial reporting period in which we had sufficient data on which to make an evaluation and reach a conclusion on the amount of income tax credit benefits related to prior year project costs that, more likely than not, qualified as research and development costs under the rules and regulations of the IRS and certain states.\nWe performed a goodwill impairment assessment for TRC as of November 1, 2018 with the assistance of a professional business valuation firm. It was determined that the fair value of TRC was less than the corresponding carrying value and a goodwill impairment loss of approximately $1.5 million was recorded. The fair value amount for TRC determined as of November 1, 2018 reflected a weighting of results determined using various business valuation approaches. As in the past, the majority of the weighted average fair value was based on the result of modeling discounted future cash flows of the business. The discounted cash flows of TRC were based on our forecast of operating results. The forecast reflects an average annual growth in revenues of 4.9% over the next seven years with forecasted annual earnings before interest and taxes increasing to 6.5% of revenues by the year ending January 31, 2026.\nExecution on Project Backlog\nEIA forecasts that coal-fired generating capacity will decrease by 101 gigawatts, or 42% of existing coal-fired capacity, by 2050, with most of the capacity reductions occurring by 2025. In addition, another 22 gigawatts of nuclear, or 22% of current nuclear power capacity, is expected to be retired by 2050. The retirements of coal and nuclear plants typically result in the need for new capacity. New natural gas-fired plants, which have experienced a significant increase in their ability to generate power efficiently, are relatively cheaper to build than coal, nuclear, or renewable plants, they are substantially more environmentally friendly than conventional coal-fired power plants and they represent the most economical way to meet base loads and peak demands and to maintain grid reliability. As natural gas is relatively clean burning, cost-effective and reliable, its benefits as a source of power generation are compelling. As the use of coal declines, the use of nuclear energy stalls, and the integration of increasing amounts of wind and solar power into energy grids continues (including renewable energy storage solutions), power providers should continue to value gas-fired electricity generation, including when needed to support intermittent renewable energy supplies. As indicated above, the share of the mix represented by wind farms\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \u201cFASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-02, Leases, which amends the existing guidance and requires the recognition of operating leases in the balance sheet. For these leases, companies will record assets for the rights and liabilities for the obligations that are created by the leases. The pronouncement will require disclosures that provide qualitative and quantitative information for the lease assets and liabilities presented in the financial statements. We adopted this pronouncement on February 1, 2019 using the permitted modified retrospective approach. Accordingly, the Company will make the required additions to the consolidated balance sheet for right-to-use assets and the corresponding lease liabilities in the range between $1.0 million to $2.0 million for operating leases existing on the adoption date.\nWe may enter into other support arrangements in the future in connection with power plant development opportunities when they arise and when we are confident that providing early financial support for the projects will lead to the award of the corresponding EPC contracts to us.\n(1) Amounts represent primarily service arrangements. Commitments pursuant to purchase orders and subcontracts related to construction contracts are not included as such amounts are expected to be funded under contract billings. We have no significant obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete contracts awarded to us.\nThe following table presents the determinations of EBITDA for Fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively (amounts in thousands).\nThe revenues of this reportable business segment (representing the business of SMC) increased by $3.5 million, or 38%, to $13.0 million during Fiscal 2018 compared with revenues of $9.4 million for Fiscal 2017, as SMC was successful in increasing the revenues related to both outside and inside premises projects.\n\u00b7 GPS entered into three EPC services contracts to construct state-of-the-art natural gas-fired power plants, having an aggregate power output of approximately 4.0 gigawatts.\nWe recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, \u201cRevenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d and a series of amendments which together we identify as \u201cASC Topic 606\u201d. This new accounting standard, which we adopted on February 1, 2018 using the permitted modified retrospective method, outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenues arising from contracts with customers. The new standard supersedes most previous revenue recognition guidance, including industry-specific guidance. The effect of the adoption of ASC Topic 606 on retained earnings as of February 1, 2018 was not material. The differences between our reported operating results for the year ended January 31, 2019, which reflect the application of the new standard on our contracts, and the results that would have been reported if the accounting was performed pursuant to the accounting standards previously in effect, also were not material.\nIn July 2018 and as discussed in Note 11 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements, TRC and PPS Engineers, Inc. (\u201cPPS\u201d) agreed to a settlement of all claims made against each other with TRC agreeing to make a payment to PPS in the amount of $0.9 million. As the total of previously accrued amounts exceeded the negotiated settlement amount, we recorded a gain on the settlement in the amount of $1.4 million that is included in other income for Fiscal 2019.", "item_7_tables": "Table 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount of Commitment Expiration per Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n</td>

FY2019 compared to $892.8 million in FY2018, primarily due to a 55% decrease in power industry services revenues as major projects were completed. \n\n- Gross profit declined 44.8% to $82.4 million in FY2019 from $149.3 million in FY2018, reflecting the lower revenues. However, gross margin increased to 17.1% from 16.7%.\n\n- Net income attributable to stockholders was $52.0 million or $3.32 per diluted share in FY2019, compared to $72.0 million or $4.56 per diluted share in FY2018. \n\n- Cash and cash equivalents decreased to $164.3 million at January 31, 2019 from $122.1 million at January 31, 2018.\n\n- Major power plant projects completed substantial work in FY2019. New projects added to backlog which grew to $1.1 billion at January 31, 2019.\n\n- Income tax expense declined substantially in FY2019 primarily due to $16.6 million in research and development tax credits recognized. \n\n- Goodwill impairment losses were recorded related to TRC in both FY2019 and FY2018. \n\n- The company adopted the new revenue recognition accounting standard with minimal impact.\n\nIn summary, revenues and profits declined in FY2019 as major power plant projects wound down, but backlog grew and income taxes were lowered by tax credits. The company maintained profitability and cash levels while adopting the new accounting standard."}
