Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nBusiness Overview\nCrocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company,\u201d Crocs,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. All of our products utilize our proprietary closed-cell resin, called CrosliteTM, along with a range of other materials. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products through a wide range of distribution channels. We currently sell our products in more than 90 countries, through three distribution channels: wholesale, retail, and e-commerce. Our wholesale channel includes domestic wholesalers as well as international wholesalers and distributors; our retail channel includes company-operated stores; and our e-commerce channel includes company-operated e-commerce sites.\nKnown or Anticipated Trends\nBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends to impact our operating results:\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Consumer spending preferences continue to shift toward e-commerce and away from brick and mortar stores. This has resulted in continued sales growth in our e-commerce channel, as well as on various e-tail sites operated by wholesalers, and contributed to declining foot traffic in our retail locations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 37: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We anticipate lower retail revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as we close less productive stores as leases expire and transfer select company-operated stores to distributors. Distributor revenues are reported within our wholesale channel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 38: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A cautious retail environment may negatively affect customer purchasing trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 39: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Foreign exchange rate volatility may continue to impact our reported U.S. Dollar results from our foreign operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 40: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In 2017 we identified annual reductions in SG&A in the amount of $75 to $85 million which, once implemented, are projected to generate an annual $30 to $35 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes by 2019, compared to 2016. We achieved approximately $23 million of these SG&A reductions in 2017 while incurring approximately $10 million of costs to re-set our variable compensation. We remain on track to achieve the targeted SG&A reductions by 2019. We incurred $11 million in non-recurring charges to achieve these SG&A reductions in 2017 and expect to incur approximately $5 million in non-recurring charges in 2018, for a total of $16 million of non-recurring charges associated with our SG&A reduction plan. We reduced our company-operated retail stores in 2017 by 111 and anticipate an additional reduction of approximately 50 company-operated retail stores in 2018, thereby reducing our total store count to approximately 400 from 558 over a two year period. The majority of company-operated store closures are occurring as store leases expire.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we present certain information related to our current period results of operations through constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nManagement uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the Board, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. We believe it also provides a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. Investors should not consider constant currency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n2017 Financial Highlights\nRevenues were $1,023.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 1.2% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in 2017 revenues compared to 2016 revenues was due to the net effects of: (i) higher sales volumes, despite a net reduction of 111 company-operated retail stores, which increased revenues by $39.6 million, or 3.8%; (ii) lower average selling prices as our product and channel mix continued to change, which decreased revenues by $57.2 million, or 5.5%; and (iii) favorable changes in exchange rates, which increased revenues by $4.8 million, or 0.5%.\nThe following were significant developments in our businesses during the year ended December 31, 2017:\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>We sold 57.9 million pairs of shoes worldwide, an increase of 3.1% from 56.1 million pairs in 2016.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Gross margin improved 220 basis points compared to 2016 to 50.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017.

We are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage by narrowing our product line with an emphasis on higher margin units, as well as developing innovative new casual lifestyle footwear platforms. By streamlining the product portfolio and reducing non-core product development, we believe we will create a more powerful consumer connection to the brand.\nWe are refining our business model around the world, prioritizing direct investment in larger-scale geographies to focus our resources on the demographics with the largest growth prospects, moving away from direct investment in retail and wholesale businesses in smaller markets, and transferring significant commercial responsibilities to distributors and other third-parties. Further, we intend to expand our engagement with leading wholesale accounts in select markets to drive sales growth, optimize product placement, and enhance brand reputation.\nResults of

Revenues decreased $12.8 million, or 1.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our Taiwan business in the fourth quarter of 2016, the sale of our Middle East business in the second quarter of 2017, reductions in the number of company-operated retail stores, and additional actions taken to optimize our wholesale, retail, and e-commerce channels. The revenue decline associated with store closures and transfers was approximately $39.1 million. Higher sales volumes increased revenues by $39.6 million, or 3.8%, offset by lower average footwear selling prices, which decreased revenues by approximately $57.2 million, or 5.5%, as our product and channel mix continued to change. Favorable exchange rate activity drove an increase of $4.8 million, or 0.5%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues decreased 5.0% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenues is due to the net impact of (i) a $46.3 million, or 4.2%, decrease associated with lower sales volumes, (ii) a $4.7 million, or 0.5%, decrease associated with lower average selling prices per pair, and (iii) a $3.4 million, or 0.3%, decrease associated with unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\nCost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of sales decreased by $29.8 million, or 5.6%, compared to the same period in 2016. Lower average costs per unit were primarily the result of changes in our product mix, reflecting an ongoing focus on core molded products, which cost less to produce, and continued supply chain cost reductions, including a reallocation of third-party manufacturing production to lower-cost suppliers within the Asia Pacific region. Higher unit sales volume increased cost of sales by $16.8 million, or 3.1%, but was more than offset by a reduction of approximately $49.6 million, or 9.3%, due to lower average costs per unit, while foreign currency translation drove an increase of $3.0 million, or 0.6%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of sales decreased $43.7 million, or 7.5%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $24.6 million, or 4.2%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $18.6 million, or 3.2%, decrease due to a lower average cost per unit sold, and (iii) a $0.5 million, or 0.1%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\nGross profit. During the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $17.1 million, or 3.4%, and gross margin increased 220 basis points to 50.5%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to our ongoing focus on higher margin core molded products, particularly clogs and sandals, and our reduction of low-margin European discount channel sales. A decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.1%, resulted from a decrease in our average selling price per unit which exceeded a decrease in average cost per unit, and an increase of approximately $15.7 million, or 3.1%, resulted from higher sales unit volumes. Foreign currency translation drove an increase of $1.7 million, or 0.3%, to gross profit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit decreased $10.6 million, or 2.1%, and gross margin increased 143 basis points to 48.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $21.6 million, or 4.2%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $14.0 million, or 2.7%, increase due to the combined impact of a lower average cost of sales per unit partially offset by a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $3.0 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit declined by approximately $1.0 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A decreased $8.6 million, or 1.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This includes the effects of $17.0 million in non-recurring charges and approximately $10 million of incremental costs related to variable compensation in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the combined impacts of a decrease in facilities expenses of $13.1 million as a result of fewer company-operated retail stores and the sales of our Taiwan and Middle East businesses, and lower bad debts expense of $3.8 million. These savings were offset in part by higher marketing expenses of $3.1 million and higher net other expenses of $5.2 million, which were individually insignificant.\nSG&A decreased $55.9 million, or 10.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This change was primarily driven by (i) bad debt expense decrease of $22.8 million, (ii) an $8.7 million decrease in rent expenses associated with contingent rents and closed retail stores partially offset by (iii) $4.3 million increase in outside services expense. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our bad debt expense was $3.2 million compared to $26.0 million in the same period in the prior year. Substantially all of this decrease in bad debt expense was due to stricter credit collection policies from our China operations, which is included in our Asia Pacific segment. Restructuring charges of $8.7 million were incurred in 2015, while none were incurred in 2016.\nAsset impairment charges. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we incurred $0.5 million, $2.7 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, in retail asset impairment charges related to certain underperforming retail locations that were unlikely to generate sufficient cash flows to fully recover the carrying value of the stores' assets over their remaining economic lives. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred additional charges of $4.8 million related to a discontinued project. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $0.4 million of goodwill impairment.\nForeign currency gain (loss), net. Foreign currency gain (loss), net, consists of unrealized and realized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency gains of $0.6 million compared to net losses of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $3.3 million.\nIncome tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized income tax expense of $7.9 million on pre-tax book income of $18.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 43.7%, compared to income tax expense of $9.3 million on pre-tax book loss of $7.2 million in 2016, which represented an effective tax rate of 128.7%. Our effective tax rate has varied dramatically in recent years due to differences in our profitability level and relative operating earnings across multiple jurisdictions, and is most notably impacted by the significant amount of operating losses that cannot be benefited for tax purposes.\nThe following are some of our key jurisdictions and the income tax expense for each in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively: Table 50: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Tax Jurisdiction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Net Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Income Tax Expense (Benefit)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>United States\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(34,406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(55,617\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>437\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(83,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,345\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Netherlands\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,859\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,184\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,988\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(69\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,345\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Canada\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>361\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(850\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(391\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(470\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(473\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,572\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Korea\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,141\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,831\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>844\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,734\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,155\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,942\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,213\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,281\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(74,744\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,452\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>128.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe differences in total tax expense and effective rate variance in the table above resulted primarily from the following factors: we recognized tax expense resulting from the Tax Act as well as increased withholding taxes related to intercompany activity which is likely to recur in the U.S; we decreased withholding tax expense in the Netherlands; we recognized net income and tax expense after incurring losses in prior years in Japan; and we recognized net income and a tax benefit as a result of recognizing the benefit of prior year tax losses in China.\nEffective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation\nThe following provide additional information about the effective income tax rate reconciliation presented in Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8.

As a result, the impact of the transition tax as well as current year distributions, and reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with undistributed earnings and profits attributable to foreign subsidiaries, the Company is reflecting a $32.4 million tax benefit, which equates to a 178.4% favorable impact on the rate reconciliation. The total income tax provision impact of this benefit is offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>\u2018Enacted changes in tax law' represents the estimated impact of the Tax Act of $17.6 million, equating to a 97.1% unfavorable impact. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings.

During 2017, the effect of rate differences resulted in an $11.8 million tax benefit, or 64.7% favorable rate impact, compared to a $12.6 million tax benefit, or 175% favorable rate impact, in 2016. The change was driven primarily by tax expense relative to profitable jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits. Further, we employ a tax planning strategy that directly impacts the total tax expense directly attributable to the level of foreign earnings in the specific jurisdictions.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our wholesale channel decreased $9.9 million, or 1.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. A $35.1 million, or 6.4%, decrease was due to lower average selling prices as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. Higher sales volumes increased revenues by approximately $21.9 million, or 4.0%, despite the impact of strategic reductions in sales via discount channels in our Europe operating segment as well as the decline in our wholesale business in Japan while we strengthen our wholesale network. The effect of foreign currency translation was an increase of $3.3 million, or 0.6%, to revenues.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our wholesale channel decreased $45.0 million, or 7.6%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in wholesale channel revenues was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $42.0 million, or 7.1%, decrease in sales volumes, (ii) a $3.6 million, or 1.0%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.4%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nRetail channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our retail channel decreased $21.4 million, or 5.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales volumes decreased by approximately $12.8 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to a net decrease of 111 company-operated retail stores as we optimized our store fleet and shifted our store mix from full-price retail to outlet. Average selling prices were lower by $10.3 million, or 2.9%, as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. These declines were partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million, or 0.6%, from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our retail channel decreased $18.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in retail channel revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $13.8 million, or 3.7%, decrease in sales volumes, (ii) a $3.6 million, or 1.0%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.4%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nE-commerce channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $18.5 million, or 14.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We invested in marketing with an enhanced digital\nfocus, and we continued to grow our e-commerce team and work toward global adoption of best practices. Revenues increased by approximately $30.6 million, or 23.4%, due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by decreases of $11.8 million, or 9.0%, due to lower average selling prices and $0.3 million, or 0.2%, due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $9.5 million, or 7.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in e-commerce revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $30.2 million, or 24.9%, increase in sales volumes (primarily due to increased sales volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific segments), (ii) a $20.0 million, or 16.4%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $0.7 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nReportable Operating Segments\nThe following table sets forth information related to our reportable operating business segments for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and

During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Americas segment increased $13.1 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues was led by a 10.3% increase in e-commerce revenues, while a modest increase in wholesale revenues was partially offset by a decrease in retail revenues, reflecting 15 fewer company-operated retail stores compared to last year. Higher sales volumes resulted in an increase of approximately $17.0 million, or 3.7%, while lower average selling prices resulted in a decrease of $5.5 million, or 1.2%, and foreign currency translation resulted in an increase of $1.6 million, or 0.3%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Americas segment decreased $9.2 million, or 1.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Americas segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $13.6 million, or 2.9%, decrease related to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $8.0 million, or 1.7%, increase related to an increase in the average selling price, and (iii) a $3.6 million, or 0.7%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nIncome from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Americas segment was $86.9 million, an increase of $28.0 million, or 47.6%. Gross profit increased $21.4 million, or 9.5%, and gross margin increased 310 basis points to 51.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit is due to the net impact of an increase of $10.3 million, or 4.6%, due to higher sales volumes, despite a net reduction of 15 company-operated retail locations, an increase of $10.9 million, or 4.8%, due to a decrease in our average cost per unit which exceeded a decrease in average selling price per unit, and an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.1%, from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $5.3 million, or 3.2%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of a decrease of $3.1 million in facilities expenses as a result of reductions in the number of company-operated retail stores and our SG&A reduction efforts, and a net decrease of $2.2 million in services, information technology, and other expenses. Impairment expense related to company-operated retail stores decreased by $1.3 million compared to 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Americas segment was $58.8 million, an increase of $9.4 million, or 19.1%. Gross profit increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, and gross margin increased 120 basis points to 48.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the Americas segment gross profit is due to the net impact of a $6.4 million, or 2.9%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, a $9.3 million, or 4.2%, increase due to the combined impact of a higher average selling price and a lower average cost of sales per unit, and a $1.9 million, or 0.9%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $1.7 million, or 1.0%, compared to the same period in 2015.\nAsia Pacific Operating Segment\nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $25.4 million, or 6.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Wholesale revenues were lower as we continued to pursue business model changes to drive higher quality revenues and improve profitability across Asia, including the sales of our Taiwan and Middle East businesses and the strengthening of our wholesale network in Japan. Retail revenues decreased as a result of a net reduction of 84 company-operated retail stores. E-commerce revenues increased by 20.1%, with particularly strong performance in China. An increase in sales volumes of approximately $38.9 million, or 9.8%, was offset by a decrease in average selling prices of $63.1 million, or 15.9%, as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. The impact of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $1.2 million, or 0.3%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $29.4 million, or 6.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $2.4 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $30.3 million, or 7.1%, decrease in the average selling price and (iii) a $3.3 million, or 0.8%, increase due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nIncome from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Asia Pacific segment was $79.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.5%. Gross profit decreased $16.1 million, or 7.2%, and gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 55.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as our channel mix shifted toward a more outlet-focused retail footprint. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment gross profit was due to the net impact of an increase in unit sales volumes\nof $22.7 million, or 10.2%, offset by a decrease in our average selling prices that exceeded the decline in our average costs per unit of $38.0 million, or 17.1%, and a decrease of $0.8 million, or 0.3%, from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $15.8 million, or 11.1%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of decreases of $3.2 million in salaries and wages and $8.0 million in facilities expenses as a result of the reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores and our SG&A reduction efforts, including the sale of our Middle East business, lower bad debts expense of $0.9 million, and a decrease of $3.7 million in services and other costs, none of which were individually significant. Impairment expense related to company operated retail stores decreased by $0.6 million compared to 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Asia Pacific segment was $78.9 million, an increase of $30.5 million, or 62.9%. Gross profit decreased $8.5 million, or 3.7%, and gross margin increased 190 basis points to 56.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment gross profit is due to the net impact of: (i) a $1.3 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $8.8 million, or 3.7%, decrease due to lower average selling prices in excess of a lower average cost per unit, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.6%, increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit declined by approximately $0.1 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $29.6 million, or 17.2%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $25.4 million decrease associated with bad debt expense, (ii) a $5.5 million increase associated with services, (iii) a $6.3 million decrease in sales expense, (iv) a $5.0 million decrease in rent expense, and (v) other items that are individually insignificant.\nEurope Operating Segment\nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Europe segment decreased $0.6 million, or 0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as we continued to reduce discount channel sales and company-operated stores, while growing our e-commerce business. Approximately $16.4 million, or 9.4%, of the decrease was due to lower unit sales volumes, partially offset by an increase of $11.4 million, or 6.6%, from higher average selling prices, and an increase of $4.4 million, or 2.4%, from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Europe segment decreased $15.4 million, or 8.1%, compared to the same period in 2015.

During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Europe segment was $25.7 million, an increase of $8.0 million, or 44.9%. Gross profit increased $3.8 million, or 4.5%, and gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 51.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the Europe segment gross profit is due to the net impact of a decrease of $9.7 million, or 11.4%, due to lower unit sales volumes, offset by an increase of $11.2 million, or 13.2%, due to increases in average selling prices, and an increase of $2.3 million, or 2.7%, from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Europe segment decreased $3.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to decreases in facilities expenses of $3.3 million as a result of the net reduction of 12 company-operated retail stores and SG&A reduction efforts, and lower bad debt expense of $2.4 million, offset in part by an increase in services and other costs of $2.2 million, none of which were individually significant. Impairment expense decreased by $0.7 million compared to 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Europe segment was $17.8 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 13.6%. Gross profit decreased $4.2 million, or 4.7%, and gross margin increased 180 basis points to 48.9% compared to the same period in 2015.

The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $2.0 increase in bad debt expense, (ii) a $0.9 million decrease in rent expense, and (iv) other items that are individually insignificant.\nOther Businesses, Unallocated Corporate\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, total net costs within \u2018Other businesses' and \u2018Unallocated corporate' increased by $12.9 million, or 8.0%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due to an increase of $9.8 million in salaries and wages, primarily related to our variable compensation, an increase of $7.8 million in marketing expenses, primarily related to our endorsement and promotional activities, and increased impairments of $4.8 million, which were partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million in travel and entertainment costs and a decrease of $7.7 million in supply chain costs. Services and other costs, none of which were individually significant, increased by $2.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total net costs within \u2018Other businesses' and \u2018Unallocated corporate' decreased by $24.2 million, or 13.0%, compared to the same period in 2015.

is a non-GAAP financial measure. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior comparative period.\n(2)Comparable store status is determined on a monthly basis. Comparable store sales includes the revenues of stores that have been in operation for more than twelve months. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15% as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth month in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce revenues are based on same site sales period over period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe anticipate our cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility (as described below) will be sufficient to meet the ongoing liquidity needs of our business for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2017, we had $172.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $99.4 million in available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, we had $147.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $78.7 million in available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017, $124.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in international locations, compared to $121.9 million at December 31, 2016. See Repatriation of Cash\u201d below for more information. We believe our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows:\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017 vs. 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>98,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>(10,972\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,657\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>(65,370\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48,927\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td>2,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(430\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,071\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,563\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,224\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted from a favorable change in net income as adjusted for non-cash items of $27.6 million, and a favorable change in our operating assets and liabilities of $30.9 million. Net income as adjusted for non-cash items increased due to: (i) an increase of $26.7 million from higher net income; (ii) an increase of $10.1 million from net unrealized foreign currency remeasurement and forward contract activity; (iii) a decrease of $3.8 million in bad debts; (iv) and a decrease of $5.4 million in other non-cash items.\nInvesting Activities. The $7.7 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $9.1 million decrease in capital expenditures for property, equipment, and software; (ii) a decrease in proceeds from asset disposals of $0.9 million; (iii) a $0.6 million decrease in restricted cash; and (iii) an increase of $0.1 million related to other investing activities.\nFinancing Activities. The $48.9 million increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from (i) repurchases of 5.7 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million; partially offset by (ii) lower net repayments on borrowings of $0.9 million; and (iii) a net decrease of $0.2 million of cash used in other financing activities.\nWorking Capital. Changes in cash from working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 were due primarily to the following: (i) a favorable change of $2.9 million from lower inventory levels, due to enhanced inventory management; (ii) a favorable change of $23.4 million in prepaid expenses and other assets; (iii) an unfavorable change of $1.8 million due to an increase in accounts receivable; and (iv) a favorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.2 million; and (v) a net favorable changes in income taxes of $5.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $24.6 million to $172.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility\nIn order to provide additional liquidity in the future and to help support our strategic goals, our revolving credit facility ( the Facility\u201d), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit agreement ( the Credit Agreement\u201d), provides for borrowings of up to $100.0 million through February 2021 (increased from $80.0 million in October 2017). The Facility contains financial covenants that restrict certain actions by us, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to $50.0 million per year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $50.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings on the Facility and $0.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in $99.4 million of available credit for future financing needs.\nIn January 2018, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with China Merchants Bank Company Limited, Shanghai Branch, or the CMBC Facility,\u201d which provides the Company a revolving loan facility of up to 30.0 million RMB, or $4.6 million, subject to consent by the lender. The CMBC Facility will mature in January 2019. For RMB loans under the CMBC Facility, interest is based on a benchmark interest rate plus a certain number of basis points upon agreement by the lender and the Company at the time of borrowing. The CMBC Facility may be canceled or suspended at any time by either party.\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement which enables the Company repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock each year, subject to certain restrictions, and increased the limit on cumulative stock repurchases from $350 million to $600 million.\nNotes Payable\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $0.7 million of current debt outstanding under notes payable, bearing fixed interest rates ranging from 1.95% to 2.83%.\nStock Repurchase Plan Authorizations\nOn December 26, 2013, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $350.0 million of our common stock. The number, price, structure, and timing of the repurchases will be at our sole discretion and may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had $68.8 million of remaining common stock repurchase authorizations under our 2013 stock repurchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made no stock repurchases.\nOn February 20, 2018, the Board approved an increased repurchase authorization up to $500.0 million of our common stock.\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $13.1 million for property, equipment, and software, compared to $22.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017 related primarily to information technology investments, opening new retail stores, and renovating existing stores. For 2018, we expect to invest approximately $20 million in capital expenditure improvements, primarily information technology and supply chain enhancements.\nRepatriation of Cash\nAs a global business, we have cash balances in various countries and amounts are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, most of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. As of December 31, 2017, we held $124.4 million of our total $172.1 million in cash in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Of the $124.4 million, $1.1 million could potentially be restricted. If the remaining $123.3 million were to be immediately repatriated to the U.S., no additional U.S. federal income tax expense would be incurred.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017, other than certain operating lease and purchase commitments, which are described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has a supply agreement which provides the Company the right to purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture its products. The supply agreement requires that the Company meet minimum purchase requirements throughout the term of the agreement, which renews annually on January 1st unless terminated by either party. Historically, the minimum purchase requirements have not been onerous and the Company does not expect them to become onerous in the future. Depending on the material purchased, pricing is based either on contracted price or is subject to quarterly reviews and fluctuates based on order volume, currency fluctuations, and raw material prices. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company guarantees the payment for certain third-party manufacturer purchases of these raw materials up to a maximum potential amount of \u20ac3.5 million (approximately $4.2 million as of December 31, 2017).\nThe following table summarizes aggregate information about our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>210,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>39,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Inventory purchase obligations with third-party manufacturers (2)\n</td> <td>122,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>122,699\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends payable (3)\n</td> <td>48,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other contracts (4)\n</td> <td>35,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Minimum licensing royalties (5)\n</td> <td>3,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt obligations (6)\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (7)\n</td> <td>44\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>421,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>215,669\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>97,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Our operating lease obligations consist of leases for retail stores, offices, warehouses, vehicles, and equipment expiring at various dates through 2033. This balance represents the minimum cash commitment under contract to various third parties for operating lease obligations including the effect of rent escalation clauses and deferred rent and minimum sublease rentals due in the future under non-cancelable subleases. This balance does not include certain contingent rent clauses that may require additional rental amounts based on sales volume, inventories, etc. as these amounts are not determinable for future periods.\n(2) Our inventory purchase obligations with third-party manufacturers consist of open purchase orders for footwear products and include an immaterial amount of purchase commitments with certain third-party manufacturers for yet-to-be-received finished product where title passes to us upon receipt. All purchase obligations with third-party manufacturers are expected to be paid within one year.\n(3) Dividends payable are associated with our Series A Preferred Stock at a rate of 6.0% of the stated value of the stock. The amounts represent\nexpected dividend payments over the eight year redemption accretion period ending January 27, 2022.\n(4) Other contracts consist of various agreements with third-party providers, primarily for IT and financial services, distribution and logistics service providers, and other agreements.\n(5) Our minimum licensing royalties consist of usage-based payments for the right to use various licenses, trademarks and copyrights in the production of our footwear and accessories. Royalty obligations are based on minimum guarantees under contract; however, may include additional royalty obligations based on sales volume that are not determinable for future periods.\n(6) Our current debt obligations consist of two notes payable related to insurance premiums.\n(7) Our capital lease obligations consist of leases for office equipment expiring at various dates through 2021. This balance represents the minimum cash commitment under contract to various third-parties for capital lease obligations.\nExcluded from the table above is a $5.4 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, outside of discussions regarding constant currency and non-GAAP financial measures, is based on the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on historical experience, complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We believe that the following discussion represents those accounting policies that are the most critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReserves for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nWe make ongoing estimates related to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our estimates are based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, economic trends and conditions affecting our customer base, significant non-recurring events, and historical write-off experience. Specific provisions are recorded for individual receivables when we become aware of a customer's inability or unwillingness to meet its financial obligations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and we may experience changes in the amount of reserves we recognize for accounts receivable that we deem uncollectible. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge, respectively, to \u2018Selling, general and administrative expenses' in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which we made such a determination. See Item 15 - Schedule II to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nSales Returns, Allowances and Discounts\nA significant area of judgment affecting reported revenues and net income involves estimating reserves for sales returns, allowances, and discounts, which represent the portion of revenues not expected to be realized. Wholesale revenues are reduced by estimates of returns, allowance, discounts, and contractual discounts to major customers. We also may accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments, and may provide markdown allowances at our sole discretion to key wholesalers and distributors to facilitate sales of slower moving products. We also record reductions to revenues for estimated customer credits as a result of price markdowns in certain markets. Revenues in our retail and e-commerce channels are also reduced by an estimate of returns.\nOur estimated sales returns and allowances are based on customer return history and actual outstanding returns yet to be received. Changes to our estimates for customer returns, allowances and discounts may be caused by many factors, including, but not limited to whether customers accept our new styles, customer inventory levels, shipping delays or errors, known or suspected product defects, the seasonal nature of our products, and macroeconomic factors affecting our customers. Historically, actual amounts of customer returns, allowances and discounts have not differed significantly from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, allowances and discounts as of December 31, 2017 would have decreased our 2017 revenues by approximately $7.0 million. See Item 15 - Schedule II to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales returns, allowances and discounts.\nInventory Valuation\nOur products are sold through wholesale distribution channels department stores, sporting goods stores, distributors, national, regional and independent retailers. We also sell directly to consumers through company-operated, full-price retail stores, kiosks, store-in-store locations, outlet stores, and e-commerce sites. Substantially all of our inventories are finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the moving average cost method.\nWe estimate the market value of inventory based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell discontinued or end of life inventory through our outlet stores, among other off-price channels. Estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and market conditions. If the estimated market value is less than its carrying value, the carrying value is adjusted to the market value and the difference is recorded in \u2018Cost of sales' in our consolidated statements of operations.\nReserves for the risk of physical loss of inventory are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts, and recorded within \u2018Cost of sales' in our consolidated statements of operations.\nImpairment of Other Long-Lived Assets\nProperty and equipment along with other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Testing of long-lived assets for impairment is at the level of an asset group, which is the is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In our retail business, the asset group for impairment testing is each individual retail store. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including the remaining useful life of each asset group, forecasted growth rates, pricing, working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash needs specific to the asset group. Additional considerations when assessing impairment include changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions, global and regional economic conditions, demand for our product and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long-lived assets. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.\nDuring 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment of $5.3 million, $3.1 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values, including a $4.8 million write-off for a discontinued project in 2017, $0.4 million related to goodwill in 2016, and $0.5 million, $2.7 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, related to underperforming company-operated retail stores. See Note 3 - Property and Equipment, Net in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to long-lived asset impairments.\nShare-Based Compensation\nStock Options\nStock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, however; they involve inherent uncertainties including market conditions and employee behavior that are generally outside of our control. Generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual results. We expense all share-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures.\nRestricted Stock Awards ( RSAs\u201d) and Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d)\nWe grant RSAs to our non-employee directors, time-based RSUs to certain executive and non-executive employees, and performance-based RSUs to certain executives. The grant date fair values of RSAs and time-based RSUs are based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted for dividend rights during the vesting period. Our performance-based RSUs vest based upon attainment of certain performance conditions, including earnings levels, revenue and cash flow targets, and certification by our Compensation Committee. The grant date fair value of these awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. This pricing model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying each performance condition stipulated in the terms of the award to estimate its grant date fair value. Compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized over the employees' requisite service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment as to achievement of certain performance metrics.\nContingencies and Legal Proceedings\nWe are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, contractual disputes, employee relations matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 - Legal Proceedings in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our contingencies and legal proceedings.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the Tax Act. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings which is referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, in 2017 we are subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act.\nWe continue to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act. As we further understand its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulator rules, regulations and interpretations, our effective tax rate could be impacted. Additional impacts from the Tax Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"). Our determination of the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed no later than one year from the enactment date as permitted under SAB 118. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be recorded and disclosed in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. The complexity of the Tax Act could necessitate the need to use the full one year measurement period to adequately interpret, analyze and conclude upon the tax effects of the Tax Act as of the enactment date.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities. We provide for income taxes at the current and future enacted tax rates and laws applicable in each taxing jurisdiction. We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. While the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the \u2018Income tax expense' line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. We determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings of the non-US subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.\nSee Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8.

estimating reserves for sales returns, allowances, and discounts, which represent the portion of revenues not expected to be realized. Wholesale revenues are reduced by estimates of returns, allowance, discounts, and contractual discounts to major customers. We also may accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments, and may provide markdown allowances at our sole discretion to key wholesalers and distributors to facilitate sales of slower moving products. We also record reductions to revenues for estimated customer credits as a result of price markdowns in certain markets. Revenues in our retail and e-commerce channels are also reduced by an estimate of returns.\nCost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of sales decreased by $29.8 million, or 5.6%, compared to the same period in 2016. Lower average costs per unit were primarily the result of changes in our product mix, reflecting an ongoing focus on core molded products, which cost less to produce, and continued supply chain cost reductions, including a reallocation of third-party manufacturing production to lower-cost suppliers within the Asia Pacific region. Higher unit sales volume increased cost of sales by $16.8 million, or 3.1%, but was more than offset by a reduction of approximately $49.6 million, or 9.3%, due to lower average costs per unit, while foreign currency translation drove an increase of $3.0 million, or 0.6%.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

As we further understand its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulator rules, regulations and interpretations, our effective tax rate could be impacted. Additional impacts from the Tax Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"). Our determination of the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed no later than one year from the enactment date as permitted under SAB 118. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be recorded and disclosed in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. The complexity of the Tax Act could necessitate the need to use the full one year measurement period to adequately interpret, analyze and conclude upon the tax effects of the Tax Act as of the enactment date.\n \u2022 SG&A was $494.6 million, a decrease of $8.6 million, or 1.7%, compared to 2016. This includes the effects of $17.0 million in non-recurring charges and approximately $10 million of incremental costs related to variable compensation in 2017. \nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Europe segment decreased $0.6 million, or 0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as we continued to reduce discount channel sales and company-operated stores, while growing our e-commerce business. Approximately $16.4 million, or 9.4%, of the decrease was due to lower unit sales volumes, partially offset by an increase of $11.4 million, or 6.6%, from higher average selling prices, and an increase of $4.4 million, or 2.4%, from foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 In 2017 we identified annual reductions in SG&A in the amount of $75 to $85 million which, once implemented, are projected to generate an annual $30 to $35 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes by 2019, compared to 2016. We achieved approximately $23 million of these SG&A reductions in 2017 while incurring approximately $10 million of costs to re-set our variable compensation. We remain on track to achieve the targeted SG&A reductions by 2019. We incurred $11 million in non-recurring charges to achieve these SG&A reductions in 2017 and expect to incur approximately $5 million in non-recurring charges in 2018, for a total of $16 million of non-recurring charges associated with our SG&A reduction plan. We reduced our company-operated retail stores in 2017 by 111 and anticipate an additional reduction of approximately 50 company-operated retail stores in 2018, thereby reducing our total store count to approximately 400 from 558 over a two year period. The majority of company-operated store closures are occurring as store leases expire. \nWe anticipate our cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility (as described below) will be sufficient to meet the ongoing liquidity needs of our business for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2017, we had $172.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $99.4 million in available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, we had $147.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $78.7 million in available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017, $124.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in international locations, compared to $121.9 million at December 31, 2016. See Repatriation of Cash\u201d below for more information. We believe our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Europe segment decreased $15.4 million, or 8.1%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Europe segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $22.8 million, or 12.1%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $10.6 million, or 5.7%, increase due to higher average selling prices, and (iii) a $3.2 million, or 1.7%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\nGeneral\n \u2022 'U.S. tax on foreign earnings' includes the impact of the tax expense accrued on undistributed foreign earnings net of the related foreign tax credits. During 2017, the Tax Act significantly changed the U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. As a result, the impact of the transition tax as well as current year distributions, and reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with undistributed earnings and profits attributable to foreign subsidiaries, the Company is reflecting a $32.4 million tax benefit, which equates to a 178.4% favorable impact on the rate reconciliation. The total income tax provision impact of this benefit is offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance. \nIncome from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Europe segment was $25.7 million, an increase of $8.0 million, or 44.9%. Gross profit increased $3.8 million, or 4.5%, and gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 51.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the Europe segment gross profit is due to the net impact of a decrease of $9.7 million, or 11.4%, due to lower unit sales volumes, offset by an increase of $11.2 million, or 13.2%, due to increases in average selling prices, and an increase of $2.3 million, or 2.7%, from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Europe segment decreased $3.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to decreases in facilities expenses of $3.3 million as a result of the net reduction of 12 company-operated retail stores and SG&A reduction efforts, and lower bad debt expense of $2.4 million, offset in part by an increase in services and other costs of $2.2 million, none of which were individually significant. Impairment expense decreased by $0.7 million compared to 2016.\nThe following are some of our key jurisdictions and the income tax expense for each in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively: \n(2)Comparable store status is determined on a monthly basis. Comparable store sales includes the revenues of stores that have been in operation for more than twelve months. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15% as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth month in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce revenues are based on same site sales period over period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Europe segment decreased $2.6 million, or 3.8%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $2.0 increase in bad debt expense, (ii) a $0.9 million decrease in rent expense, and (iv) other items that are individually insignificant.\nof $22.7 million, or 10.2%, offset by a decrease in our average selling prices that exceeded the decline in our average costs per unit of $38.0 million, or 17.1%, and a decrease of $0.8 million, or 0.3%, from foreign currency translation.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, outside of discussions regarding constant currency and non-GAAP financial measures, is based on the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis.\nEffective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation\nStock Repurchase Plan Authorizations\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A decreased $8.6 million, or 1.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This includes the effects of $17.0 million in non-recurring charges and approximately $10 million of incremental costs related to variable compensation in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the combined impacts of a decrease in facilities expenses of $13.1 million as a result of fewer company-operated retail stores and the sales of our Taiwan and Middle East businesses, and lower bad debts expense of $3.8 million. These savings were offset in part by higher marketing expenses of $3.1 million and higher net other expenses of $5.2 million, which were individually insignificant.\n\n(2) Our inventory purchase obligations with third-party manufacturers consist of open purchase orders for footwear products and include an immaterial amount of purchase commitments with certain third-party manufacturers for yet-to-be-received finished product where title passes to us upon receipt. All purchase obligations with third-party manufacturers are expected to be paid within one year.\nStock Options\nOur estimated sales returns and allowances are based on customer return history and actual outstanding returns yet to be received. Changes to our estimates for customer returns, allowances and discounts may be caused by many factors, including, but not limited to whether customers accept our new styles, customer inventory levels, shipping delays or errors, known or suspected product defects, the seasonal nature of our products, and macroeconomic factors affecting our customers. Historically, actual amounts of customer returns, allowances and discounts have not differed significantly from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, allowances and discounts as of December 31, 2017 would have decreased our 2017 revenues by approximately $7.0 million. See Item 15 - Schedule II to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales returns, allowances and discounts.\nGross profit. During the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $17.1 million, or 3.4%, and gross margin increased 220 basis points to 50.5%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to our ongoing focus on higher margin core molded products, particularly clogs and sandals, and our reduction of low-margin European discount channel sales. A decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.1%, resulted from a decrease in our average selling price per unit which exceeded a decrease in average cost per unit, and an increase of approximately $15.7 million, or 3.1%, resulted from higher sales unit volumes. Foreign currency translation drove an increase of $1.7 million, or 0.3%, to gross profit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $1.7 million, or 1.0%, compared to the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Europe segment was $17.8 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 13.6%. Gross profit decreased $4.2 million, or 4.7%, and gross margin increased 180 basis points to 48.9% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Europe segment gross profit was due to the net impact of: (i) a $10.8 million, or 12.1%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $8.3 million, or 9.3%, increase due to a higher average selling price in excess of higher costs per unit, and (iii) a $1.7 million, or 1.9%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 The change in 'Foreign differential' is principally driven by differences in pre-tax book income between the periods compared and the source of this income, which is subject to different jurisdictional tax rates. During 2017, the effect of rate differences resulted in an $11.8 million tax benefit, or 64.7% favorable rate impact, compared to a $12.6 million tax benefit, or 175% favorable rate impact, in 2016. The change was driven primarily by tax expense relative to profitable jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits. Further, we employ a tax planning strategy that directly impacts the total tax expense directly attributable to the level of foreign earnings in the specific jurisdictions. However, we note that the impact on the effective tax rate is different due to book earnings recorded in 2017 compared to 2016. Through \nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRepatriation of Cash\n \u2022 \u2018Enacted changes in tax law' represents the estimated impact of the Tax Act of $17.6 million, equating to a 97.1% unfavorable impact. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. Additionally, in 2017 we were subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings for which U.S. tax was not previously accrued. \nAsset impairment charges. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we incurred $0.5 million, $2.7 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, in retail asset impairment charges related to certain underperforming retail locations that were unlikely to generate sufficient cash flows to fully recover the carrying value of the stores' assets over their remaining economic lives. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred additional charges of $4.8 million related to a discontinued project. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $0.4 million of goodwill impairment.\nat least 2019, we expect to continue to have an equivalent favorable impact on the tax provision and effective tax rate based on the specific foreign earnings.\n\n \u2022 We sold 57.9 million pairs of shoes worldwide, an increase of 3.1% from 56.1 million pairs in 2016. \n(6) Our current debt obligations consist of two notes payable related to insurance premiums.\nCapital Expenditures\nIncome tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized income tax expense of $7.9 million on pre-tax book income of $18.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 43.7%, compared to income tax expense of $9.3 million on pre-tax book loss of $7.2 million in 2016, which represented an effective tax rate of 128.7%. Our effective tax rate has varied dramatically in recent years due to differences in our profitability level and relative operating earnings across multiple jurisdictions, and is most notably impacted by the significant amount of operating losses that cannot be benefited for tax purposes.\nThe table below illustrates the overall change in the number of our company-operated retail locations by type of store and reportable operating segment:\n\n(2) Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nResults of Operations\n(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information.\n(1) Our operating lease obligations consist of leases for retail stores, offices, warehouses, vehicles, and equipment expiring at various dates through 2033. This balance represents the minimum cash commitment under contract to various third parties for operating lease obligations including the effect of rent escalation clauses and deferred rent and minimum sublease rentals due in the future under non-cancelable subleases. This balance does not include certain contingent rent clauses that may require additional rental amounts based on sales volume, inventories, etc. as these amounts are not determinable for future periods.\nIn order to provide additional liquidity in the future and to help support our strategic goals, our revolving credit facility ( the Facility\u201d), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit agreement ( the Credit Agreement\u201d), provides for borrowings of up to $100.0 million through February 2021 (increased from $80.0 million in October 2017). The Facility contains financial covenants that restrict certain actions by us, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to $50.0 million per year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $50.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nFuture Outlook\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRestricted Stock Awards ( RSAs\u201d) and Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d)\nOn December 26, 2013, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $350.0 million of our common stock. The number, price, structure, and timing of the repurchases will be at our sole discretion and may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.\n \u2022 Net loss attributable to common stockholders improved $26.4 million to a loss of $5.3 million compared to a loss of $31.7 million in 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per common share was $0.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a loss of $0.43 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016. \nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings on the Facility and $0.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in $99.4 million of available credit for future financing needs.\nNotes Payable\nSales Returns, Allowances and Discounts\nDuring 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment of $5.3 million, $3.1 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values, including a $4.8 million write-off for a discontinued project in 2017, $0.4 million related to goodwill in 2016, and $0.5 million, $2.7 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, related to underperforming company-operated retail stores. See Note 3 - Property and Equipment, Net in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to long-lived asset impairments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table summarizes aggregate information about our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Asia Pacific segment was $78.9 million, an increase of $30.5 million, or 62.9%. Gross profit decreased $8.5 million, or 3.7%, and gross margin increased 190 basis points to 56.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment gross profit is due to the net impact of: (i) a $1.3 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $8.8 million, or 3.7%, decrease due to lower average selling prices in excess of a lower average cost per unit, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.6%, increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit declined by approximately $0.1 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit decreased $10.6 million, or 2.1%, and gross margin increased 143 basis points to 48.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $21.6 million, or 4.2%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $14.0 million, or 2.7%, increase due to the combined impact of a lower average cost of sales per unit partially offset by a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $3.0 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit declined by approximately $1.0 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement which enables the Company repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock each year, subject to certain restrictions, and increased the limit on cumulative stock repurchases from $350 million to $600 million.\nWe make ongoing estimates related to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our estimates are based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, economic trends and conditions affecting our customer base, significant non-recurring events, and historical write-off experience. Specific provisions are recorded for individual receivables when we become aware of a customer's inability or unwillingness to meet its financial obligations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and we may experience changes in the amount of reserves we recognize for accounts receivable that we deem uncollectible. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge, respectively, to \u2018Selling, general and administrative expenses' in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which we made such a determination. See Item 15 - Schedule II to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our wholesale channel decreased $45.0 million, or 7.6%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in wholesale channel revenues was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $42.0 million, or 7.1%, decrease in sales volumes, (ii) a $3.6 million, or 1.0%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.4%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nThe following were significant developments in our businesses during the year ended December 31, 2017:\nAs a result of the Tax Act, most of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. As of December 31, 2017, we held $124.4 million of our total $172.1 million in cash in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Of the $124.4 million, $1.1 million could potentially be restricted. If the remaining $123.3 million were to be immediately repatriated to the U.S., no additional U.S. federal income tax expense would be incurred.\n \u2022 We incur state income tax losses during the period due to net operating losses recorded in the U.S., as well as applicable state modifications related to the taxability of foreign dividends. The tax provision benefit of these losses are offset by a valuation allowance. We are subject to certain minimal state income taxes. \nWe believe these initiatives will better position Crocs to adapt to changing customer demands and global economic developments. We are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage by narrowing our product line with an emphasis on higher margin units, as well as developing innovative new casual lifestyle footwear platforms. By streamlining the product portfolio and reducing non-core product development, we believe we will create a more powerful consumer connection to the brand.\n \u2022 We continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The impact of changes in valuation accounts to the effective tax rate was $24.4 million recorded on deferred tax assets that are not anticipated to be realized, equating to a 134.2% unfavorable impact. The specific circumstances regarding management's assertion of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets is discussed as part of the disclosures in Note 11 - Income Taxes. We maintain total valuation allowances of approximately $119.5 million as of December 31, 2017, which may be reduced in the future depending upon the achieved or sustained profitability of certain entities. \nAsia Pacific Operating Segment\n(1) simplifying our business to reduce costs,\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, total net costs within \u2018Other businesses' and \u2018Unallocated corporate' increased by $12.9 million, or 8.0%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due to an increase of $9.8 million in salaries and wages, primarily related to our variable compensation, an increase of $7.8 million in marketing expenses, primarily related to our endorsement and promotional activities, and increased impairments of $4.8 million, which were partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million in travel and entertainment costs and a decrease of $7.7 million in supply chain costs. Services and other costs, none of which were individually significant, increased by $2.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Americas segment was $58.8 million, an increase of $9.4 million, or 19.1%. Gross profit increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, and gross margin increased 120 basis points to 48.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the Americas segment gross profit is due to the net impact of a $6.4 million, or 2.9%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, a $9.3 million, or 4.2%, increase due to the combined impact of a higher average selling price and a lower average cost of sales per unit, and a $1.9 million, or 0.9%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 During 2017, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.0 million. \nexpected dividend payments over the eight year redemption accretion period ending January 27, 2022.\n2017 Financial Highlights\nContingencies and Legal Proceedings\nProperty and equipment along with other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Testing of long-lived assets for impairment is at the level of an asset group, which is the is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In our retail business, the asset group for impairment testing is each individual retail store. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.\n(1) Reflects period over period change on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior comparative period.\nFinancing Activities. The $48.9 million increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from (i) repurchases of 5.7 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million; partially offset by (ii) lower net repayments on borrowings of $0.9 million; and (iii) a net decrease of $0.2 million of cash used in other financing activities.\nExcluded from the table above is a $5.4 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of sales decreased $43.7 million, or 7.5%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $24.6 million, or 4.2%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $18.6 million, or 3.2%, decrease due to a lower average cost per unit sold, and (iii) a $0.5 million, or 0.1%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $15.8 million, or 11.1%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of decreases of $3.2 million in salaries and wages and $8.0 million in facilities expenses as a result of the reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores and our SG&A reduction efforts, including the sale of our Middle East business, lower bad debts expense of $0.9 million, and a decrease of $3.7 million in services and other costs, none of which were individually significant. Impairment expense related to company operated retail stores decreased by $0.6 million compared to 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $9.5 million, or 7.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in e-commerce revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $30.2 million, or 24.9%, increase in sales volumes (primarily due to increased sales volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific segments), (ii) a $20.0 million, or 16.4%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $0.7 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nStock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, however; they involve inherent uncertainties including market conditions and employee behavior that are generally outside of our control. Generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual results. We expense all share-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures.\nForeign currency gain (loss), net. Foreign currency gain (loss), net, consists of unrealized and realized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency gains of $0.6 million compared to net losses of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $3.3 million.\nReserves for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\n \u2022 During both 2017 and 2016, we recorded tax expense for audits settled during the year of $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The amount included in settlements during 2017 is netted against total uncertain tax position releases during the same period relating to the same positions. Furthermore, in Note 11 - Income Taxes the \u2018Uncertain tax benefits' line item in 2017 includes net accruals related to current year positions recorded, and is consistent with amounts accrued during prior years. We have released a significant portion of historical uncertain tax benefits based on effective and actual settlements. There is not currently an expectation that uncertain tax positions will significantly impact our tax expense on an ongoing basis. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our retail channel decreased $18.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in retail channel revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $13.8 million, or 3.7%, decrease in sales volumes, (ii) a $3.6 million, or 1.0%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.4%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had $68.8 million of remaining common stock repurchase authorizations under our 2013 stock repurchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made no stock repurchases.\nRevenues by Channel\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities. We provide for income taxes at the current and future enacted tax rates and laws applicable in each taxing jurisdiction. We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. While the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the \u2018Income tax expense' line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nfocus, and we continued to grow our e-commerce team and work toward global adoption of best practices. Revenues increased by approximately $30.6 million, or 23.4%, due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by decreases of $11.8 million, or 9.0%, due to lower average selling prices and $0.3 million, or 0.2%, due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $13.1 million for property, equipment, and software, compared to $22.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017 related primarily to information technology investments, opening new retail stores, and renovating existing stores. For 2018, we expect to invest approximately $20 million in capital expenditure improvements, primarily information technology and supply chain enhancements.\nOther Businesses, Unallocated Corporate\nWe estimate the market value of inventory based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell discontinued or end of life inventory through our outlet stores, among other off-price channels. Estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and market conditions. If the estimated market value is less than its carrying value, the carrying value is adjusted to the market value and the difference is recorded in \u2018Cost of sales' in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $29.4 million, or 6.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $2.4 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $30.3 million, or 7.1%, decrease in the average selling price and (iii) a $3.3 million, or 0.8%, increase due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nThe differences in total tax expense and effective rate variance in the table above resulted primarily from the following factors: we recognized tax expense resulting from the Tax Act as well as increased withholding taxes related to intercompany activity which is likely to recur in the U.S; we decreased withholding tax expense in the Netherlands; we recognized net income and tax expense after incurring losses in prior years in Japan; and we recognized net income and a tax benefit as a result of recognizing the benefit of prior year tax losses in China.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, contractual disputes, employee relations matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 - Legal Proceedings in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our contingencies and legal proceedings.\nSee Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to income taxes.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has a supply agreement which provides the Company the right to purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture its products. The supply agreement requires that the Company meet minimum purchase requirements throughout the term of the agreement, which renews annually on January 1st unless terminated by either party. Historically, the minimum purchase requirements have not been onerous and the Company does not expect them to become onerous in the future. Depending on the material purchased, pricing is based either on contracted price or is subject to quarterly reviews and fluctuates based on order volume, currency fluctuations, and raw material prices. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company guarantees the payment for certain third-party manufacturer purchases of these raw materials up to a maximum potential amount of \u20ac3.5 million (approximately $4.2 million as of December 31, 2017).\nKnown or Anticipated Trends\n \u2022 We continued to focus on simplifying our product line and disciplined inventory management to allow investment in higher margin, faster-turning product and reduced our inventory by $16.7 million, or 11.3%, from $147.0 million to $130.3 million. \nRevenues. Revenues decreased $12.8 million, or 1.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our Taiwan business in the fourth quarter of 2016, the sale of our Middle East business in the second quarter of 2017, reductions in the number of company-operated retail stores, and additional actions taken to optimize our wholesale, retail, and e-commerce channels. The revenue decline associated with store closures and transfers was approximately $39.1 million. Higher sales volumes increased revenues by $39.6 million, or 3.8%, offset by lower average footwear selling prices, which decreased revenues by approximately $57.2 million, or 5.5%, as our product and channel mix continued to change. Favorable exchange rate activity drove an increase of $4.8 million, or 0.5%.\nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $25.4 million, or 6.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Wholesale revenues were lower as we continued to pursue business model changes to drive higher quality revenues and improve profitability across Asia, including the sales of our Taiwan and Middle East businesses and the strengthening of our wholesale network in Japan. Retail revenues decreased as a result of a net reduction of 84 company-operated retail stores. E-commerce revenues increased by 20.1%, with particularly strong performance in China. An increase in sales volumes of approximately $38.9 million, or 9.8%, was offset by a decrease in average selling prices of $63.1 million, or 15.9%, as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. The impact of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $1.2 million, or 0.3%.\nComparable retail store sales and direct to consumer comparable store sales by reportable operating segment are as follows:\nBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends to impact our operating results:\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues decreased 5.0% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenues is due to the net impact of (i) a $46.3 million, or 4.2%, decrease associated with lower sales volumes, (ii) a $4.7 million, or 0.5%, decrease associated with lower average selling prices per pair, and (iii) a $3.4 million, or 0.3%, decrease associated with unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\n(3) Dividends payable are associated with our Series A Preferred Stock at a rate of 6.0% of the stated value of the stock. The amounts represent\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility\nIn 2017, we began operating under a tax holiday in one of our foreign jurisdictions. This tax holiday is in effect through 2022, and may be extended if certain additional requirements are met. The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of the tax holiday in 2017 decreased tax expense in that jurisdiction by approximately $0.1 million and had no impact to our reported earnings per diluted share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nInventory Valuation\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including the remaining useful life of each asset group, forecasted growth rates, pricing, working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash needs specific to the asset group. Additional considerations when assessing impairment include changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions, global and regional economic conditions, demand for our product and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long-lived assets. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on historical experience, complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We believe that the following discussion represents those accounting policies that are the most critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSG&A decreased $55.9 million, or 10.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This change was primarily driven by (i) bad debt expense decrease of $22.8 million, (ii) an $8.7 million decrease in rent expenses associated with contingent rents and closed retail stores partially offset by (iii) $4.3 million increase in outside services expense. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our bad debt expense was $3.2 million compared to $26.0 million in the same period in the prior year. Substantially all of this decrease in bad debt expense was due to stricter credit collection policies from our China operations, which is included in our Asia Pacific segment. Restructuring charges of $8.7 million were incurred in 2015, while none were incurred in 2016.\nReportable Operating Segments\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted from a favorable change in net income as adjusted for non-cash items of $27.6 million, and a favorable change in our operating assets and liabilities of $30.9 million. Net income as adjusted for non-cash items increased due to: (i) an increase of $26.7 million from higher net income; (ii) an increase of $10.1 million from net unrealized foreign currency remeasurement and forward contract activity; (iii) a decrease of $3.8 million in bad debts; (iv) and a decrease of $5.4 million in other non-cash items.\nStore Locations and Comparable Store Sales\nOn February 20, 2018, the Board approved an increased repurchase authorization up to $500.0 million of our common stock.\nWe grant RSAs to our non-employee directors, time-based RSUs to certain executive and non-executive employees, and performance-based RSUs to certain executives. The grant date fair values of RSAs and time-based RSUs are based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted for dividend rights during the vesting period. Our performance-based RSUs vest based upon attainment of certain performance conditions, including earnings levels, revenue and cash flow targets, and certification by our Compensation Committee. The grant date fair value of these awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. This pricing model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying each performance condition stipulated in the terms of the award to estimate its grant date fair value. Compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized over the employees' requisite service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment as to achievement of certain performance metrics.\n \u2022 Foreign exchange rate volatility may continue to impact our reported U.S. Dollar results from our foreign operations. \nEurope Operating Segment\n(3) positioning ourselves to return to sustainable, profitable growth.\nBusiness Overview\nThe following provide additional information about the effective income tax rate reconciliation presented in Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\nCrocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company,\u201d Crocs,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. All of our products utilize our proprietary closed-cell resin, called CrosliteTM, along with a range of other materials. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products through a wide range of distribution channels. We currently sell our products in more than 90 countries, through three distribution channels: wholesale, retail, and e-commerce. Our wholesale channel includes domestic wholesalers as well as international wholesalers and distributors; our retail channel includes company-operated stores; and our e-commerce channel includes company-operated e-commerce sites.\nInvesting Activities. The $7.7 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $9.1 million decrease in capital expenditures for property, equipment, and software; (ii) a decrease in proceeds from asset disposals of $0.9 million; (iii) a $0.6 million decrease in restricted cash; and (iii) an increase of $0.1 million related to other investing activities.\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total net costs within \u2018Other businesses' and \u2018Unallocated corporate' decreased by $24.2 million, or 13.0%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in corporate unallocated SG&A costs as a result of our SG&A cost reduction efforts.\nWorking Capital. Changes in cash from working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 were due primarily to the following: (i) a favorable change of $2.9 million from lower inventory levels, due to enhanced inventory management; (ii) a favorable change of $23.4 million in prepaid expenses and other assets; (iii) an unfavorable change of $1.8 million due to an increase in accounts receivable; and (iv) a favorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.2 million; and (v) a net favorable changes in income taxes of $5.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $24.6 million to $172.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nWe intend to continue our strategic plans for long-term improvement and growth of the business, which comprise these key initiatives:\nE-commerce channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $18.5 million, or 14.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We invested in marketing with an enhanced digital\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $29.6 million, or 17.2%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $25.4 million decrease associated with bad debt expense, (ii) a $5.5 million increase associated with services, (iii) a $6.3 million decrease in sales expense, (iv) a $5.0 million decrease in rent expense, and (v) other items that are individually insignificant.\n(1) Changes for gross margin and operating margin are shown in basis points ( bp\u201d).\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we present certain information related to our current period results of operations through constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $5.3 million, or 3.2%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of a decrease of $3.1 million in facilities expenses as a result of reductions in the number of company-operated retail stores and our SG&A reduction efforts, and a net decrease of $2.2 million in services, information technology, and other expenses. Impairment expense related to company-operated retail stores decreased by $1.3 million compared to 2016.\nSee Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and issued accounting pronouncements that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. We determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings of the non-US subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.\n(5) Our minimum licensing royalties consist of usage-based payments for the right to use various licenses, trademarks and copyrights in the production of our footwear and accessories. Royalty obligations are based on minimum guarantees under contract; however, may include additional royalty obligations based on sales volume that are not determinable for future periods.\nWe are refining our business model around the world, prioritizing direct investment in larger-scale geographies to focus our resources on the demographics with the largest growth prospects, moving away from direct investment in retail and wholesale businesses in smaller markets, and transferring significant commercial responsibilities to distributors and other third-parties. Further, we intend to expand our engagement with leading wholesale accounts in select markets to drive sales growth, optimize product placement, and enhance brand reputation.\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017, other than certain operating lease and purchase commitments, which are described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nOur products are sold through wholesale distribution channels department stores, sporting goods stores, distributors, national, regional and independent retailers. We also sell directly to consumers through company-operated, full-price retail stores, kiosks, store-in-store locations, outlet stores, and e-commerce sites. Substantially all of our inventories are finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the moving average cost method.\n \u2022 We anticipate lower retail revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as we close less productive stores as leases expire and transfer select company-operated stores to distributors. Distributor revenues are reported within our wholesale channel. \nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the Tax Act. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings which is referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, in 2017 we are subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act.\n \u2022 Income from operations improved by $23.5 million, after incurring approximately $17.0 million in non-recurring charges, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to last year's loss of $6.2 million. \nReserves for the risk of physical loss of inventory are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts, and recorded within \u2018Cost of sales' in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWholesale channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our wholesale channel decreased $9.9 million, or 1.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. A $35.1 million, or 6.4%, decrease was due to lower average selling prices as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. Higher sales volumes increased revenues by approximately $21.9 million, or 4.0%, despite the impact of strategic reductions in sales via discount channels in our Europe operating segment as well as the decline in our wholesale business in Japan while we strengthen our wholesale network. The effect of foreign currency translation was an increase of $3.3 million, or 0.6%, to revenues.\nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Americas segment increased $13.1 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues was led by a 10.3% increase in e-commerce revenues, while a modest increase in wholesale revenues was partially offset by a decrease in retail revenues, reflecting 15 fewer company-operated retail stores compared to last year. Higher sales volumes resulted in an increase of approximately $17.0 million, or 3.7%, while lower average selling prices resulted in a decrease of $5.5 million, or 1.2%, and foreign currency translation resulted in an increase of $1.6 million, or 0.3%.\n(2) improving the quality of our revenues, and\n \u2022 A cautious retail environment may negatively affect customer purchasing trends. \nIncome from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Asia Pacific segment was $79.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.5%. Gross profit decreased $16.1 million, or 7.2%, and gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 55.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as our channel mix shifted toward a more outlet-focused retail footprint. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment gross profit was due to the net impact of an increase in unit sales volumes\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $0.7 million of current debt outstanding under notes payable, bearing fixed interest rates ranging from 1.95% to 2.83%.\nRevenues were $1,023.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 1.2% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in 2017 revenues compared to 2016 revenues was due to the net effects of: (i) higher sales volumes, despite a net reduction of 111 company-operated retail stores, which increased revenues by $39.6 million, or 3.8%; (ii) lower average selling prices as our product and channel mix continued to change, which decreased revenues by $57.2 million, or 5.5%; and (iii) favorable changes in exchange rates, which increased revenues by $4.8 million, or 0.5%.\nImpairment of Other Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Americas segment decreased $9.2 million, or 1.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Americas segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $13.6 million, or 2.9%, decrease related to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $8.0 million, or 1.7%, increase related to an increase in the average selling price, and (iii) a $3.6 million, or 0.7%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nRetail channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our retail channel decreased $21.4 million, or 5.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales volumes decreased by approximately $12.8 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to a net decrease of 111 company-operated retail stores as we optimized our store fleet and shifted our store mix from full-price retail to outlet. Average selling prices were lower by $10.3 million, or 2.9%, as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. These declines were partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million, or 0.6%, from foreign currency translation.\n(7) Our capital lease obligations consist of leases for office equipment expiring at various dates through 2021. This balance represents the minimum cash commitment under contract to various third-parties for capital lease obligations.", "item_7_text": " \u2022 Gross margin improved 220 basis points compared to 2016 to 50.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017. We drove this improvement by continuing to prioritize high margin molded product, improving our go to market capabilities, and better managing promotions. \n(4) Other contracts consist of various agreements with third-party providers, primarily for IT and financial services, distribution and logistics service providers, and other agreements.\nOur consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows:\nManagement uses constant currency to assist in comparing business trends from period to period on a consistent basis in communications with the Board, stockholders, analysts, and investors concerning our financial performance. We believe constant currency is useful to investors and other users of our consolidated financial statements as an additional tool to evaluate operating performance. We believe it also provides a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our operations. Investors should not consider constant currency in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nAs a global business, we have cash balances in various countries and amounts are denominated in various currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and cash positions. Future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources. Cash balances held in foreign countries may have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them which could adversely impact our liquidity and our ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities.\nIn January 2018, the Company entered into a revolving credit facility with China Merchants Bank Company Limited, Shanghai Branch, or the CMBC Facility,\u201d which provides the Company a revolving loan facility of up to 30.0 million RMB, or $4.6 million, subject to consent by the lender. The CMBC Facility will mature in January 2019. For RMB loans under the CMBC Facility, interest is based on a benchmark interest rate plus a certain number of basis points upon agreement by the lender and the Company at the time of borrowing. The CMBC Facility may be canceled or suspended at any time by either party.\nAmericas Operating Segment\nA significant area of judgment affecting reported revenues and net income involves estimating reserves for sales returns, allowances, and discounts, which represent the portion of revenues not expected to be realized. Wholesale revenues are reduced by estimates of returns, allowance, discounts, and contractual discounts to major customers. We also may accept returns from our wholesale customers, on an exception basis, to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments, and may provide markdown allowances at our sole discretion to key wholesalers and distributors to facilitate sales of slower moving products. We also record reductions to revenues for estimated customer credits as a result of price markdowns in certain markets. Revenues in our retail and e-commerce channels are also reduced by an estimate of returns.\nCost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of sales decreased by $29.8 million, or 5.6%, compared to the same period in 2016. Lower average costs per unit were primarily the result of changes in our product mix, reflecting an ongoing focus on core molded products, which cost less to produce, and continued supply chain cost reductions, including a reallocation of third-party manufacturing production to lower-cost suppliers within the Asia Pacific region. Higher unit sales volume increased cost of sales by $16.8 million, or 3.1%, but was more than offset by a reduction of approximately $49.6 million, or 9.3%, due to lower average costs per unit, while foreign currency translation drove an increase of $3.0 million, or 0.6%.\nIncome from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Americas segment was $86.9 million, an increase of $28.0 million, or 47.6%. Gross profit increased $21.4 million, or 9.5%, and gross margin increased 310 basis points to 51.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in gross profit is due to the net impact of an increase of $10.3 million, or 4.6%, due to higher sales volumes, despite a net reduction of 15 company-operated retail locations, an increase of $10.9 million, or 4.8%, due to a decrease in our average cost per unit which exceeded a decrease in average selling price per unit, and an increase of $0.2 million, or 0.1%, from foreign currency translation.\n\n \u2022 \u2018Non-deductible/non-taxable items' resulted in a $6.0 million tax expense in 2017, representing an unfavorable rate impact of 33.0%, compared to a $2.7 million tax expense in 2016, representing an unfavorable rate impact of 37.4%. The expense recognized in 2017 primarily relates to non-deductible executive and foreign share-based compensation, which we anticipate will recur in the foreseeable future, and the write-off of non-deductible goodwill, which we do not expect to recur in the foreseeable future. \nThe following table sets forth information related to our reportable operating business segments for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015:\n \u2022 We continued to focus on improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations, including carefully managing and reducing our retail fleet, especially full-priced retail stores, and focusing on enhancing the profitability of this channel. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we opened a total of 19 stores and closed or transferred to distributors 130 stores for a net reduction of 111 company-operated retail stores. \n \u2022 Consumer spending preferences continue to shift toward e-commerce and away from brick and mortar stores. This has resulted in continued sales growth in our e-commerce channel, as well as on various e-tail sites operated by wholesalers, and contributed to declining foot traffic in our retail locations. \nWe continue to evaluate the impacts of the Tax Act. As we further understand its implications, as well as the related, and yet to be issued, regulator rules, regulations and interpretations, our effective tax rate could be impacted. Additional impacts from the Tax Act will be recorded as they are identified during the measurement period pursuant to Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (\"SAB 118\"). Our determination of the tax effects of the Tax Act will be completed no later than one year from the enactment date as permitted under SAB 118. Any adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period will be recorded and disclosed in the reporting period in which the adjustment is determined. The complexity of the Tax Act could necessitate the need to use the full one year measurement period to adequately interpret, analyze and conclude upon the tax effects of the Tax Act as of the enactment date.\n \u2022 SG&A was $494.6 million, a decrease of $8.6 million, or 1.7%, compared to 2016. This includes the effects of $17.0 million in non-recurring charges and approximately $10 million of incremental costs related to variable compensation in 2017. \nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Europe segment decreased $0.6 million, or 0.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, as we continued to reduce discount channel sales and company-operated stores, while growing our e-commerce business. Approximately $16.4 million, or 9.4%, of the decrease was due to lower unit sales volumes, partially offset by an increase of $11.4 million, or 6.6%, from higher average selling prices, and an increase of $4.4 million, or 2.4%, from foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 In 2017 we identified annual reductions in SG&A in the amount of $75 to $85 million which, once implemented, are projected to generate an annual $30 to $35 million improvement in earnings before interest and taxes by 2019, compared to 2016. We achieved approximately $23 million of these SG&A reductions in 2017 while incurring approximately $10 million of costs to re-set our variable compensation. We remain on track to achieve the targeted SG&A reductions by 2019. We incurred $11 million in non-recurring charges to achieve these SG&A reductions in 2017 and expect to incur approximately $5 million in non-recurring charges in 2018, for a total of $16 million of non-recurring charges associated with our SG&A reduction plan. We reduced our company-operated retail stores in 2017 by 111 and anticipate an additional reduction of approximately 50 company-operated retail stores in 2018, thereby reducing our total store count to approximately 400 from 558 over a two year period. The majority of company-operated store closures are occurring as store leases expire. \nWe anticipate our cash flows from operations and available borrowings under our Senior Revolving Credit Facility (as described below) will be sufficient to meet the ongoing liquidity needs of our business for the next twelve months. As of December 31, 2017, we had $172.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $99.4 million in available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, we had $147.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and up to $78.7 million in available borrowings under our revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2017, $124.4 million of our cash and cash equivalents was held in international locations, compared to $121.9 million at December 31, 2016. See Repatriation of Cash\u201d below for more information. We believe our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months. Additional future financing may be necessary to fund our operations and there can be no assurance that, if needed, we will be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Europe segment decreased $15.4 million, or 8.1%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Europe segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $22.8 million, or 12.1%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $10.6 million, or 5.7%, increase due to higher average selling prices, and (iii) a $3.2 million, or 1.7%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\nGeneral\n \u2022 'U.S. tax on foreign earnings' includes the impact of the tax expense accrued on undistributed foreign earnings net of the related foreign tax credits. During 2017, the Tax Act significantly changed the U.S. taxation of foreign earnings. As a result, the impact of the transition tax as well as current year distributions, and reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with undistributed earnings and profits attributable to foreign subsidiaries, the Company is reflecting a $32.4 million tax benefit, which equates to a 178.4% favorable impact on the rate reconciliation. The total income tax provision impact of this benefit is offset by a corresponding change in the valuation allowance. \nIncome from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Europe segment was $25.7 million, an increase of $8.0 million, or 44.9%. Gross profit increased $3.8 million, or 4.5%, and gross margin increased by 240 basis points to 51.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the Europe segment gross profit is due to the net impact of a decrease of $9.7 million, or 11.4%, due to lower unit sales volumes, offset by an increase of $11.2 million, or 13.2%, due to increases in average selling prices, and an increase of $2.3 million, or 2.7%, from foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Europe segment decreased $3.5 million, or 5.2%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to decreases in facilities expenses of $3.3 million as a result of the net reduction of 12 company-operated retail stores and SG&A reduction efforts, and lower bad debt expense of $2.4 million, offset in part by an increase in services and other costs of $2.2 million, none of which were individually significant. Impairment expense decreased by $0.7 million compared to 2016.\nThe following are some of our key jurisdictions and the income tax expense for each in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively: \n(2)Comparable store status is determined on a monthly basis. Comparable store sales includes the revenues of stores that have been in operation for more than twelve months. Stores in which selling square footage has changed more than 15% as a result of a remodel, expansion, or reduction are excluded until the thirteenth month in which they have comparable prior year sales. Temporarily closed stores are excluded from the comparable store sales calculation during the month of closure. Location closures in excess of three months are excluded until the thirteenth month post re-opening. E-commerce revenues are based on same site sales period over period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Europe segment decreased $2.6 million, or 3.8%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $2.0 increase in bad debt expense, (ii) a $0.9 million decrease in rent expense, and (iv) other items that are individually insignificant.\nof $22.7 million, or 10.2%, offset by a decrease in our average selling prices that exceeded the decline in our average costs per unit of $38.0 million, or 17.1%, and a decrease of $0.8 million, or 0.3%, from foreign currency translation.\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations, outside of discussions regarding constant currency and non-GAAP financial measures, is based on the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on-going basis.\nEffective Income Tax Rate Reconciliation\nStock Repurchase Plan Authorizations\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. SG&A decreased $8.6 million, or 1.7%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. This includes the effects of $17.0 million in non-recurring charges and approximately $10 million of incremental costs related to variable compensation in 2017. The decrease was primarily due to the combined impacts of a decrease in facilities expenses of $13.1 million as a result of fewer company-operated retail stores and the sales of our Taiwan and Middle East businesses, and lower bad debts expense of $3.8 million. These savings were offset in part by higher marketing expenses of $3.1 million and higher net other expenses of $5.2 million, which were individually insignificant.\n\n(2) Our inventory purchase obligations with third-party manufacturers consist of open purchase orders for footwear products and include an immaterial amount of purchase commitments with certain third-party manufacturers for yet-to-be-received finished product where title passes to us upon receipt. All purchase obligations with third-party manufacturers are expected to be paid within one year.\nStock Options\nOur estimated sales returns and allowances are based on customer return history and actual outstanding returns yet to be received. Changes to our estimates for customer returns, allowances and discounts may be caused by many factors, including, but not limited to whether customers accept our new styles, customer inventory levels, shipping delays or errors, known or suspected product defects, the seasonal nature of our products, and macroeconomic factors affecting our customers. Historically, actual amounts of customer returns, allowances and discounts have not differed significantly from our estimates. A hypothetical 1% increase in our reserves for returns, allowances and discounts as of December 31, 2017 would have decreased our 2017 revenues by approximately $7.0 million. See Item 15 - Schedule II to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales returns, allowances and discounts.\nGross profit. During the year ended December 31, 2017, gross profit increased $17.1 million, or 3.4%, and gross margin increased 220 basis points to 50.5%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to our ongoing focus on higher margin core molded products, particularly clogs and sandals, and our reduction of low-margin European discount channel sales. A decrease of $0.3 million, or 0.1%, resulted from a decrease in our average selling price per unit which exceeded a decrease in average cost per unit, and an increase of approximately $15.7 million, or 3.1%, resulted from higher sales unit volumes. Foreign currency translation drove an increase of $1.7 million, or 0.3%, to gross profit.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $1.7 million, or 1.0%, compared to the same period in 2015.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Europe segment was $17.8 million, an increase of $2.1 million, or 13.6%. Gross profit decreased $4.2 million, or 4.7%, and gross margin increased 180 basis points to 48.9% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Europe segment gross profit was due to the net impact of: (i) a $10.8 million, or 12.1%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $8.3 million, or 9.3%, increase due to a higher average selling price in excess of higher costs per unit, and (iii) a $1.7 million, or 1.9%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 The change in 'Foreign differential' is principally driven by differences in pre-tax book income between the periods compared and the source of this income, which is subject to different jurisdictional tax rates. During 2017, the effect of rate differences resulted in an $11.8 million tax benefit, or 64.7% favorable rate impact, compared to a $12.6 million tax benefit, or 175% favorable rate impact, in 2016. The change was driven primarily by tax expense relative to profitable jurisdictions, partially offset by operating losses in certain jurisdictions where the Company has determined that it is not more likely than not to realize the associated tax benefits. Further, we employ a tax planning strategy that directly impacts the total tax expense directly attributable to the level of foreign earnings in the specific jurisdictions. However, we note that the impact on the effective tax rate is different due to book earnings recorded in 2017 compared to 2016. Through \nITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRepatriation of Cash\n \u2022 \u2018Enacted changes in tax law' represents the estimated impact of the Tax Act of $17.6 million, equating to a 97.1% unfavorable impact. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings. Additionally, in 2017 we were subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings for which U.S. tax was not previously accrued. \nAsset impairment charges. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we incurred $0.5 million, $2.7 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, in retail asset impairment charges related to certain underperforming retail locations that were unlikely to generate sufficient cash flows to fully recover the carrying value of the stores' assets over their remaining economic lives. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we incurred additional charges of $4.8 million related to a discontinued project. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred $0.4 million of goodwill impairment.\nat least 2019, we expect to continue to have an equivalent favorable impact on the tax provision and effective tax rate based on the specific foreign earnings.\n\n \u2022 We sold 57.9 million pairs of shoes worldwide, an increase of 3.1% from 56.1 million pairs in 2016. \n(6) Our current debt obligations consist of two notes payable related to insurance premiums.\nCapital Expenditures\nIncome tax expense. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized income tax expense of $7.9 million on pre-tax book income of $18.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 43.7%, compared to income tax expense of $9.3 million on pre-tax book loss of $7.2 million in 2016, which represented an effective tax rate of 128.7%. Our effective tax rate has varied dramatically in recent years due to differences in our profitability level and relative operating earnings across multiple jurisdictions, and is most notably impacted by the significant amount of operating losses that cannot be benefited for tax purposes.\nThe table below illustrates the overall change in the number of our company-operated retail locations by type of store and reportable operating segment:\n\n(2) Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nResults of Operations\n(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information.\n(1) Our operating lease obligations consist of leases for retail stores, offices, warehouses, vehicles, and equipment expiring at various dates through 2033. This balance represents the minimum cash commitment under contract to various third parties for operating lease obligations including the effect of rent escalation clauses and deferred rent and minimum sublease rentals due in the future under non-cancelable subleases. This balance does not include certain contingent rent clauses that may require additional rental amounts based on sales volume, inventories, etc. as these amounts are not determinable for future periods.\nIn order to provide additional liquidity in the future and to help support our strategic goals, our revolving credit facility ( the Facility\u201d), pursuant to an Amended and Restated Credit agreement ( the Credit Agreement\u201d), provides for borrowings of up to $100.0 million through February 2021 (increased from $80.0 million in October 2017). The Facility contains financial covenants that restrict certain actions by us, including limitations on: (i) stock repurchases to $50.0 million per year, subject to certain restrictions; and (ii) capital expenditures and commitments to $50.0 million per year. The Credit Agreement also permits intercompany loans of up to $375.0 million and requires the Company to meet certain financial covenant ratios that become effective when average outstanding borrowings under the Credit Agreement, including letters of credit, exceed the lesser of $40.0 million or 40% of the total commitments during certain periods or if the outstanding borrowings exceed the borrowing base. If the financial covenant ratios are in effect, the Company must maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of 1.10 to 1.00, and a maximum leverage ratio of 2.00 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2017, the Company was in compliance with all financial covenants.\nFuture Outlook\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRestricted Stock Awards ( RSAs\u201d) and Restricted Stock Units ( RSUs\u201d)\nOn December 26, 2013, the Board approved the repurchase of up to $350.0 million of our common stock. The number, price, structure, and timing of the repurchases will be at our sole discretion and may be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and does not oblige us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. The Board may suspend, modify, or terminate the repurchase program at any time without prior notice.\n \u2022 Net loss attributable to common stockholders improved $26.4 million to a loss of $5.3 million compared to a loss of $31.7 million in 2016. Basic and diluted net loss per common share was $0.07 for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a loss of $0.43 per common share for the year ended December 31, 2016. \nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding borrowings on the Facility and $0.6 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in $99.4 million of available credit for future financing needs.\nNotes Payable\nSales Returns, Allowances and Discounts\nDuring 2017, 2016, and 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment of $5.3 million, $3.1 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long-lived assets to their estimated fair values, including a $4.8 million write-off for a discontinued project in 2017, $0.4 million related to goodwill in 2016, and $0.5 million, $2.7 million, and $15.3 million, respectively, related to underperforming company-operated retail stores. See Note 3 - Property and Equipment, Net in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to long-lived asset impairments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table summarizes aggregate information about our significant contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Asia Pacific segment was $78.9 million, an increase of $30.5 million, or 62.9%. Gross profit decreased $8.5 million, or 3.7%, and gross margin increased 190 basis points to 56.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment gross profit is due to the net impact of: (i) a $1.3 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $8.8 million, or 3.7%, decrease due to lower average selling prices in excess of a lower average cost per unit, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.6%, increase due to the impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit declined by approximately $0.1 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, gross profit decreased $10.6 million, or 2.1%, and gross margin increased 143 basis points to 48.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in gross profit is primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $21.6 million, or 4.2%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $14.0 million, or 2.7%, increase due to the combined impact of a lower average cost of sales per unit partially offset by a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $3.0 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Gross profit declined by approximately $1.0 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nIn February 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the Credit Agreement which enables the Company repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock each year, subject to certain restrictions, and increased the limit on cumulative stock repurchases from $350 million to $600 million.\nWe make ongoing estimates related to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our estimates are based on a variety of factors, including the length of time receivables are past due, economic trends and conditions affecting our customer base, significant non-recurring events, and historical write-off experience. Specific provisions are recorded for individual receivables when we become aware of a customer's inability or unwillingness to meet its financial obligations. Because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers, actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and we may experience changes in the amount of reserves we recognize for accounts receivable that we deem uncollectible. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, a larger reserve might be required. In the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate, we would record a credit or a charge, respectively, to \u2018Selling, general and administrative expenses' in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which we made such a determination. See Item 15 - Schedule II to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our wholesale channel decreased $45.0 million, or 7.6%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in wholesale channel revenues was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $42.0 million, or 7.1%, decrease in sales volumes, (ii) a $3.6 million, or 1.0%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.4%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nThe following were significant developments in our businesses during the year ended December 31, 2017:\nAs a result of the Tax Act, most of the cash held outside of the U.S. could be repatriated to the U.S. without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes. In some countries, repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country. As of December 31, 2017, we held $124.4 million of our total $172.1 million in cash in international locations. This cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held. Of the $124.4 million, $1.1 million could potentially be restricted. If the remaining $123.3 million were to be immediately repatriated to the U.S., no additional U.S. federal income tax expense would be incurred.\n \u2022 We incur state income tax losses during the period due to net operating losses recorded in the U.S., as well as applicable state modifications related to the taxability of foreign dividends. The tax provision benefit of these losses are offset by a valuation allowance. We are subject to certain minimal state income taxes. \nWe believe these initiatives will better position Crocs to adapt to changing customer demands and global economic developments. We are focusing on our core molded footwear heritage by narrowing our product line with an emphasis on higher margin units, as well as developing innovative new casual lifestyle footwear platforms. By streamlining the product portfolio and reducing non-core product development, we believe we will create a more powerful consumer connection to the brand.\n \u2022 We continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets. The impact of changes in valuation accounts to the effective tax rate was $24.4 million recorded on deferred tax assets that are not anticipated to be realized, equating to a 134.2% unfavorable impact. The specific circumstances regarding management's assertion of the realizability of certain deferred tax assets is discussed as part of the disclosures in Note 11 - Income Taxes. We maintain total valuation allowances of approximately $119.5 million as of December 31, 2017, which may be reduced in the future depending upon the achieved or sustained profitability of certain entities. \nAsia Pacific Operating Segment\n(1) simplifying our business to reduce costs,\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, total net costs within \u2018Other businesses' and \u2018Unallocated corporate' increased by $12.9 million, or 8.0%, compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was due to an increase of $9.8 million in salaries and wages, primarily related to our variable compensation, an increase of $7.8 million in marketing expenses, primarily related to our endorsement and promotional activities, and increased impairments of $4.8 million, which were partially offset by a decrease of $3.8 million in travel and entertainment costs and a decrease of $7.7 million in supply chain costs. Services and other costs, none of which were individually significant, increased by $2.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, income from operations for our Americas segment was $58.8 million, an increase of $9.4 million, or 19.1%. Gross profit increased $1.0 million, or 0.4%, and gross margin increased 120 basis points to 48.3% compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in the Americas segment gross profit is due to the net impact of a $6.4 million, or 2.9%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, a $9.3 million, or 4.2%, increase due to the combined impact of a higher average selling price and a lower average cost of sales per unit, and a $1.9 million, or 0.9%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\n \u2022 During 2017, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of $50.0 million. \nexpected dividend payments over the eight year redemption accretion period ending January 27, 2022.\n2017 Financial Highlights\nContingencies and Legal Proceedings\nProperty and equipment along with other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. Testing of long-lived assets for impairment is at the level of an asset group, which is the is the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. In our retail business, the asset group for impairment testing is each individual retail store. In evaluating long-lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition, where applicable. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value, less costs to sell.\n(1) Reflects period over period change on a constant currency basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using exchange rates used in the prior comparative period.\nFinancing Activities. The $48.9 million increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from (i) repurchases of 5.7 million shares of our common stock for $50.0 million; partially offset by (ii) lower net repayments on borrowings of $0.9 million; and (iii) a net decrease of $0.2 million of cash used in other financing activities.\nExcluded from the table above is a $5.4 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2017, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cost of sales decreased $43.7 million, or 7.5%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $24.6 million, or 4.2%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $18.6 million, or 3.2%, decrease due to a lower average cost per unit sold, and (iii) a $0.5 million, or 0.1%, decrease due to the impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $15.8 million, or 11.1%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of decreases of $3.2 million in salaries and wages and $8.0 million in facilities expenses as a result of the reduction in the number of company-operated retail stores and our SG&A reduction efforts, including the sale of our Middle East business, lower bad debts expense of $0.9 million, and a decrease of $3.7 million in services and other costs, none of which were individually significant. Impairment expense related to company operated retail stores decreased by $0.6 million compared to 2016.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $9.5 million, or 7.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in e-commerce revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $30.2 million, or 24.9%, increase in sales volumes (primarily due to increased sales volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific segments), (ii) a $20.0 million, or 16.4%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $0.7 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nStock options are granted to employees and non-employee directors with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options, which requires the use of assumptions, including the expected term of the option, expected volatility of our stock price, our expected dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate, among others. These assumptions reflect our best estimates, however; they involve inherent uncertainties including market conditions and employee behavior that are generally outside of our control. Generally, once stock option values are determined, accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from actual results. We expense all share-based compensation awarded to employees and non-employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for forfeitures.\nForeign currency gain (loss), net. Foreign currency gain (loss), net, consists of unrealized and realized foreign currency gains and losses from the remeasurement and settlement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies as well as realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency derivative instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency gains of $0.6 million compared to net losses of $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized realized and unrealized net foreign currency losses of $3.3 million.\nReserves for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\n \u2022 During both 2017 and 2016, we recorded tax expense for audits settled during the year of $0.4 million and $0.3 million, respectively. The amount included in settlements during 2017 is netted against total uncertain tax position releases during the same period relating to the same positions. Furthermore, in Note 11 - Income Taxes the \u2018Uncertain tax benefits' line item in 2017 includes net accruals related to current year positions recorded, and is consistent with amounts accrued during prior years. We have released a significant portion of historical uncertain tax benefits based on effective and actual settlements. There is not currently an expectation that uncertain tax positions will significantly impact our tax expense on an ongoing basis. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues from our retail channel decreased $18.9 million, or 5.0%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in retail channel revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $13.8 million, or 3.7%, decrease in sales volumes, (ii) a $3.6 million, or 1.0%, decrease due to a lower average selling price, and (iii) a $1.5 million, or 0.4%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we repurchased 5.7 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $50.0 million. As of December 31, 2017, we had $68.8 million of remaining common stock repurchase authorizations under our 2013 stock repurchase plan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we made no stock repurchases.\nRevenues by Channel\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities. We provide for income taxes at the current and future enacted tax rates and laws applicable in each taxing jurisdiction. We use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained. No portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. Interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. While the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law, the body of statutory, regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the \u2018Income tax expense' line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets.\nfocus, and we continued to grow our e-commerce team and work toward global adoption of best practices. Revenues increased by approximately $30.6 million, or 23.4%, due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by decreases of $11.8 million, or 9.0%, due to lower average selling prices and $0.3 million, or 0.2%, due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid $13.1 million for property, equipment, and software, compared to $22.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2017 related primarily to information technology investments, opening new retail stores, and renovating existing stores. For 2018, we expect to invest approximately $20 million in capital expenditure improvements, primarily information technology and supply chain enhancements.\nOther Businesses, Unallocated Corporate\nWe estimate the market value of inventory based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and a forecast of future demand, giving consideration to the value of current orders in-house for future sales of inventory, as well as plans to sell discontinued or end of life inventory through our outlet stores, among other off-price channels. Estimates may differ from actual results due to the quantity, quality, and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences, and market conditions. If the estimated market value is less than its carrying value, the carrying value is adjusted to the market value and the difference is recorded in \u2018Cost of sales' in our consolidated statements of operations.\n(1) Reflects year over year change as if the current period results were in constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure. See Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d for more information.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $29.4 million, or 6.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $2.4 million, or 0.6%, decrease due to lower sales volumes, (ii) a $30.3 million, or 7.1%, decrease in the average selling price and (iii) a $3.3 million, or 0.8%, increase due to the favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2016 were negatively impacted by approximately $8.4 million as a result of the sale of our South Africa operations, which was completed on April 15, 2016.\nThe differences in total tax expense and effective rate variance in the table above resulted primarily from the following factors: we recognized tax expense resulting from the Tax Act as well as increased withholding taxes related to intercompany activity which is likely to recur in the U.S; we decreased withholding tax expense in the Netherlands; we recognized net income and tax expense after incurring losses in prior years in Japan; and we recognized net income and a tax benefit as a result of recognizing the benefit of prior year tax losses in China.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigation, contractual disputes, employee relations matters, various tax or other governmental audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations, if practicable. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties, and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on management's judgment in developing the related estimates and assumptions. See Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies and Note 15 - Legal Proceedings in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our contingencies and legal proceedings.\nSee Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information related to income taxes.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has a supply agreement which provides the Company the right to purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture its products. The supply agreement requires that the Company meet minimum purchase requirements throughout the term of the agreement, which renews annually on January 1st unless terminated by either party. Historically, the minimum purchase requirements have not been onerous and the Company does not expect them to become onerous in the future. Depending on the material purchased, pricing is based either on contracted price or is subject to quarterly reviews and fluctuates based on order volume, currency fluctuations, and raw material prices. Pursuant to the agreement, the Company guarantees the payment for certain third-party manufacturer purchases of these raw materials up to a maximum potential amount of \u20ac3.5 million (approximately $4.2 million as of December 31, 2017).\nKnown or Anticipated Trends\n \u2022 We continued to focus on simplifying our product line and disciplined inventory management to allow investment in higher margin, faster-turning product and reduced our inventory by $16.7 million, or 11.3%, from $147.0 million to $130.3 million. \nRevenues. Revenues decreased $12.8 million, or 1.2%, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016. The revenues decreased primarily due to the sale of our Taiwan business in the fourth quarter of 2016, the sale of our Middle East business in the second quarter of 2017, reductions in the number of company-operated retail stores, and additional actions taken to optimize our wholesale, retail, and e-commerce channels. The revenue decline associated with store closures and transfers was approximately $39.1 million. Higher sales volumes increased revenues by $39.6 million, or 3.8%, offset by lower average footwear selling prices, which decreased revenues by approximately $57.2 million, or 5.5%, as our product and channel mix continued to change. Favorable exchange rate activity drove an increase of $4.8 million, or 0.5%.\nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $25.4 million, or 6.4%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Wholesale revenues were lower as we continued to pursue business model changes to drive higher quality revenues and improve profitability across Asia, including the sales of our Taiwan and Middle East businesses and the strengthening of our wholesale network in Japan. Retail revenues decreased as a result of a net reduction of 84 company-operated retail stores. E-commerce revenues increased by 20.1%, with particularly strong performance in China. An increase in sales volumes of approximately $38.9 million, or 9.8%, was offset by a decrease in average selling prices of $63.1 million, or 15.9%, as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. The impact of foreign currency translation was a decrease of $1.2 million, or 0.3%.\nComparable retail store sales and direct to consumer comparable store sales by reportable operating segment are as follows:\nBased on our recent operating results and current perspectives on our operating environment, we anticipate certain trends to impact our operating results:\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues decreased 5.0% compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in revenues is due to the net impact of (i) a $46.3 million, or 4.2%, decrease associated with lower sales volumes, (ii) a $4.7 million, or 0.5%, decrease associated with lower average selling prices per pair, and (iii) a $3.4 million, or 0.3%, decrease associated with unfavorable changes in foreign currency rates.\n(3) Dividends payable are associated with our Series A Preferred Stock at a rate of 6.0% of the stated value of the stock. The amounts represent\nSenior Revolving Credit Facility\nIn 2017, we began operating under a tax holiday in one of our foreign jurisdictions. This tax holiday is in effect through 2022, and may be extended if certain additional requirements are met. The tax holiday is conditional upon our meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The impact of the tax holiday in 2017 decreased tax expense in that jurisdiction by approximately $0.1 million and had no impact to our reported earnings per diluted share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nInventory Valuation\nIn determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including the remaining useful life of each asset group, forecasted growth rates, pricing, working capital, capital expenditures, and other cash needs specific to the asset group. Additional considerations when assessing impairment include changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions, global and regional economic conditions, demand for our product and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long-lived assets. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, future impairments may arise in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations.\nAn accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on historical experience, complex judgments, assessments of probability, and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. We believe that the following discussion represents those accounting policies that are the most critical to the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations. For a discussion of our significant accounting policies, see Note 1 - Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSG&A decreased $55.9 million, or 10.0%, during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. This change was primarily driven by (i) bad debt expense decrease of $22.8 million, (ii) an $8.7 million decrease in rent expenses associated with contingent rents and closed retail stores partially offset by (iii) $4.3 million increase in outside services expense. During the year ended December 31, 2016, our bad debt expense was $3.2 million compared to $26.0 million in the same period in the prior year. Substantially all of this decrease in bad debt expense was due to stricter credit collection policies from our China operations, which is included in our Asia Pacific segment. Restructuring charges of $8.7 million were incurred in 2015, while none were incurred in 2016.\nReportable Operating Segments\nOperating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities increased $58.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in cash provided by operating activities resulted from a favorable change in net income as adjusted for non-cash items of $27.6 million, and a favorable change in our operating assets and liabilities of $30.9 million. Net income as adjusted for non-cash items increased due to: (i) an increase of $26.7 million from higher net income; (ii) an increase of $10.1 million from net unrealized foreign currency remeasurement and forward contract activity; (iii) a decrease of $3.8 million in bad debts; (iv) and a decrease of $5.4 million in other non-cash items.\nStore Locations and Comparable Store Sales\nOn February 20, 2018, the Board approved an increased repurchase authorization up to $500.0 million of our common stock.\nWe grant RSAs to our non-employee directors, time-based RSUs to certain executive and non-executive employees, and performance-based RSUs to certain executives. The grant date fair values of RSAs and time-based RSUs are based on the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date, adjusted for dividend rights during the vesting period. Our performance-based RSUs vest based upon attainment of certain performance conditions, including earnings levels, revenue and cash flow targets, and certification by our Compensation Committee. The grant date fair value of these awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model. This pricing model utilizes multiple input variables that determine the probability of satisfying each performance condition stipulated in the terms of the award to estimate its grant date fair value. Compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized over the employees' requisite service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment as to achievement of certain performance metrics.\n \u2022 Foreign exchange rate volatility may continue to impact our reported U.S. Dollar results from our foreign operations. \nEurope Operating Segment\n(3) positioning ourselves to return to sustainable, profitable growth.\nBusiness Overview\nThe following provide additional information about the effective income tax rate reconciliation presented in Note 11 - Income Taxes in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K:\n\nCrocs, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively, the Company,\u201d Crocs,\u201d we,\u201d our,\u201d or us\u201d) are engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, worldwide marketing, distribution, and sale of casual lifestyle footwear and accessories for men, women, and children. We strive to be the global leader in the sale of molded footwear characterized by functionality, comfort, color, and lightweight design. All of our products utilize our proprietary closed-cell resin, called CrosliteTM, along with a range of other materials. The broad appeal of our footwear has allowed us to market our products through a wide range of distribution channels. We currently sell our products in more than 90 countries, through three distribution channels: wholesale, retail, and e-commerce. Our wholesale channel includes domestic wholesalers as well as international wholesalers and distributors; our retail channel includes company-operated stores; and our e-commerce channel includes company-operated e-commerce sites.\nInvesting Activities. The $7.7 million decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $9.1 million decrease in capital expenditures for property, equipment, and software; (ii) a decrease in proceeds from asset disposals of $0.9 million; (iii) a $0.6 million decrease in restricted cash; and (iii) an increase of $0.1 million related to other investing activities.\n\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, total net costs within \u2018Other businesses' and \u2018Unallocated corporate' decreased by $24.2 million, or 13.0%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in corporate unallocated SG&A costs as a result of our SG&A cost reduction efforts.\nWorking Capital. Changes in cash from working capital for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 were due primarily to the following: (i) a favorable change of $2.9 million from lower inventory levels, due to enhanced inventory management; (ii) a favorable change of $23.4 million in prepaid expenses and other assets; (iii) an unfavorable change of $1.8 million due to an increase in accounts receivable; and (iv) a favorable change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $1.2 million; and (v) a net favorable changes in income taxes of $5.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $24.6 million to $172.1 million as of December 31, 2017.\nWe intend to continue our strategic plans for long-term improvement and growth of the business, which comprise these key initiatives:\nE-commerce channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our e-commerce channel increased $18.5 million, or 14.2%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. We invested in marketing with an enhanced digital\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, SG&A for our Asia Pacific segment decreased $29.6 million, or 17.2%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of: (i) a $25.4 million decrease associated with bad debt expense, (ii) a $5.5 million increase associated with services, (iii) a $6.3 million decrease in sales expense, (iv) a $5.0 million decrease in rent expense, and (v) other items that are individually insignificant.\n(1) Changes for gross margin and operating margin are shown in basis points ( bp\u201d).\nShare-Based Compensation\nIn addition to financial measures presented on the basis of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d), we present certain information related to our current period results of operations through constant currency,\u201d which is a non-GAAP financial measure and should be viewed as a supplement to our results of operations and presentation of reportable segments under U.S. GAAP. Constant currency represents current period results that have been retranslated using prior year average foreign exchange rates for the comparative period to enhance the visibility of the underlying business trends excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, SG&A for our Americas segment decreased $5.3 million, or 3.2%, compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease in SG&A was primarily due to the net impact of a decrease of $3.1 million in facilities expenses as a result of reductions in the number of company-operated retail stores and our SG&A reduction efforts, and a net decrease of $2.2 million in services, information technology, and other expenses. Impairment expense related to company-operated retail stores decreased by $1.3 million compared to 2016.\nSee Note 2 - Recent Accounting Pronouncements in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of recently adopted accounting pronouncements, and issued accounting pronouncements that we believe may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when adopted.\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results, the reversal of existing temporary differences, taxable income in prior carry back years (if permitted) and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset. We determine on a regular basis the amount of undistributed earnings that will be indefinitely reinvested in our non-U.S. operations. This assessment is based on the cash flow projections and operational and fiscal objectives of each of our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries. Foreign withholding taxes have not been provided on cumulative undistributed foreign earnings of the non-US subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017 which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the United States.\n(5) Our minimum licensing royalties consist of usage-based payments for the right to use various licenses, trademarks and copyrights in the production of our footwear and accessories. Royalty obligations are based on minimum guarantees under contract; however, may include additional royalty obligations based on sales volume that are not determinable for future periods.\nWe are refining our business model around the world, prioritizing direct investment in larger-scale geographies to focus our resources on the demographics with the largest growth prospects, moving away from direct investment in retail and wholesale businesses in smaller markets, and transferring significant commercial responsibilities to distributors and other third-parties. Further, we intend to expand our engagement with leading wholesale accounts in select markets to drive sales growth, optimize product placement, and enhance brand reputation.\nWe had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017, other than certain operating lease and purchase commitments, which are described in Note 13 - Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome Taxes\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2017\nOur products are sold through wholesale distribution channels department stores, sporting goods stores, distributors, national, regional and independent retailers. We also sell directly to consumers through company-operated, full-price retail stores, kiosks, store-in-store locations, outlet stores, and e-commerce sites. Substantially all of our inventories are finished goods, which are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined using the moving average cost method.\n \u2022 We anticipate lower retail revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses ( SG&A\u201d) as we close less productive stores as leases expire and transfer select company-operated stores to distributors. Distributor revenues are reported within our wholesale channel. \nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions, determining our provision for income taxes, and evaluating the impact of the Tax Act. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017 and introduces significant changes to U.S. income tax law. Effective in 2018, the Tax Act reduces the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and creates new taxes on certain foreign-sourced earnings which is referred to as the global intangible low-taxed income. In addition, in 2017 we are subject to a one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings not previously subject to U.S. income tax. Accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates in the interpretation and calculations of the provisions of the Tax Act.\n \u2022 Income from operations improved by $23.5 million, after incurring approximately $17.0 million in non-recurring charges, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to last year's loss of $6.2 million. \nReserves for the risk of physical loss of inventory are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts, and recorded within \u2018Cost of sales' in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWholesale channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our wholesale channel decreased $9.9 million, or 1.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. A $35.1 million, or 6.4%, decrease was due to lower average selling prices as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. Higher sales volumes increased revenues by approximately $21.9 million, or 4.0%, despite the impact of strategic reductions in sales via discount channels in our Europe operating segment as well as the decline in our wholesale business in Japan while we strengthen our wholesale network. The effect of foreign currency translation was an increase of $3.3 million, or 0.6%, to revenues.\nRevenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues for our Americas segment increased $13.1 million, or 2.8%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in revenues was led by a 10.3% increase in e-commerce revenues, while a modest increase in wholesale revenues was partially offset by a decrease in retail revenues, reflecting 15 fewer company-operated retail stores compared to last year. Higher sales volumes resulted in an increase of approximately $17.0 million, or 3.7%, while lower average selling prices resulted in a decrease of $5.5 million, or 1.2%, and foreign currency translation resulted in an increase of $1.6 million, or 0.3%.\n(2) improving the quality of our revenues, and\n \u2022 A cautious retail environment may negatively affect customer purchasing trends. \nIncome from Operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, income from operations for our Asia Pacific segment was $79.3 million, an increase of $0.4 million, or 0.5%. Gross profit decreased $16.1 million, or 7.2%, and gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 55.8% compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 as our channel mix shifted toward a more outlet-focused retail footprint. The decrease in the Asia Pacific segment gross profit was due to the net impact of an increase in unit sales volumes\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $0.7 million of current debt outstanding under notes payable, bearing fixed interest rates ranging from 1.95% to 2.83%.\nRevenues were $1,023.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a 1.2% decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in 2017 revenues compared to 2016 revenues was due to the net effects of: (i) higher sales volumes, despite a net reduction of 111 company-operated retail stores, which increased revenues by $39.6 million, or 3.8%; (ii) lower average selling prices as our product and channel mix continued to change, which decreased revenues by $57.2 million, or 5.5%; and (iii) favorable changes in exchange rates, which increased revenues by $4.8 million, or 0.5%.\nImpairment of Other Long-Lived Assets\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues for our Americas segment decreased $9.2 million, or 1.9%, compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease in the Americas segment revenues was due to the net impact of: (i) a $13.6 million, or 2.9%, decrease related to lower sales volumes, (ii) an $8.0 million, or 1.7%, increase related to an increase in the average selling price, and (iii) a $3.6 million, or 0.7%, decrease due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation.\nRetail channel revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2017, revenues from our retail channel decreased $21.4 million, or 5.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Sales volumes decreased by approximately $12.8 million, or 3.6%, primarily due to a net decrease of 111 company-operated retail stores as we optimized our store fleet and shifted our store mix from full-price retail to outlet. Average selling prices were lower by $10.3 million, or 2.9%, as we shifted to higher margin, lower-priced molded product. These declines were partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million, or 0.6%, from foreign currency translation.\n(7) Our capital lease obligations consist of leases for office equipment expiring at various dates through 2021.

lower average selling prices as the product and channel mix continued to shift, partially offset by higher sales volumes. \n\n- Gross margin increased 220 basis points to 50.5% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to a focus on higher margin molded products.\n\n- Income from operations was $17.3 million in 2017, an improvement from a loss of $6.2 million in 2016, despite $17 million in non-recurring charges.
