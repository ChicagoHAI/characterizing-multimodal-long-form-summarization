Our diagnostics business includes Bio-Reference Laboratories ( Bio-Reference\u201d), the nation's third-largest clinical laboratory with a core genetic testing business and a 400-person sales and marketing team to drive growth and leverage new products, including the 4Kscore prostate cancer test and the Claros 1 in-office immunoassay platform (in development). Our pharmaceutical business features Rayaldee, an FDA-approved treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT\u201d) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease ( CKD\u201d) and vitamin D insufficiency (launched in November 2016), and VARUBI\u2122 for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (oral formulation launched by partner TESARO in November 2015 and pending approval for IV formulation), TT401, a once or twice weekly oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity which is a clinically advanced drug candidate among the new class of GLP-1 glucagon receptor dual agonists (Phase 2b) , and TT701, an androgen receptor modulator for androgen deficiency indications. Our pharmaceutical business also features hGH-CTP, a once-weekly human growth hormone injection (in Phase 3 and partnered with Pfizer), a once-daily Factor VIIa drug for hemophilia (Phase 2a), and long-acting oxyntomodulin ( OXM\u201d) for diabetes and obesity (Phase 1).\nWe operate established pharmaceutical platforms in Spain, Ireland, Chile and Mexico, which are generating revenue and from which we expect to generate positive cash flow and facilitate future market entry for our products currently in development. EirGen, our specialty pharmaceutical manufacturing and development site in Ireland, is focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products. In addition, we operate a specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs\u201d) manufacturer in Israel, which we expect will facilitate the development of our pipeline of molecules and compounds for our proprietary products.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIn November 2016, we launched commercial sales for Rayaldee in the U.S. market. The FDA approved Rayaldee extended release capsules in June 2016 for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. We have a highly specialized sales and marketing team dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee, and we expect to increase the sales and marketing team in the second half of 2017.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor The Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $729.9 million compared to the prior year. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 208: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,012,129\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>682,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from products\n</td> <td>83,467\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from transfer of intellectual property and other\n</td> <td>126,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,221,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>729,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in Revenue from services is attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in Revenue from products principally reflects an increase in revenue from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, and an increase in revenue from OPKO Chile. Revenue from transfer of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2016 principally reflects $50.0 million of revenue from the initial payment in the VFMCRP Agreement and $70.6 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction. Revenue from transfer of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2015 principally reflects $65.5 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction and $15.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee, TESARO, in the fourth quarter of 2015. We are recognizing the non-refundable $295.0 million upfront payments received in the Pfizer Transaction on a straight-line basis over the expected performance period. The performance period is expected to continue through 2019, when we anticipate completing the various research and development services that are specified in the Pfizer Transaction.\nCosts of revenue. Costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $376.2 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $375.9 million of the increase in cost of service revenue. The increase in cost of product revenue is attributable to an increase in cost of revenue from EirGen and OPKO Chile, which was partially offset by the deconsolidation of SciVac Therapeutics Inc. ( STI\u201d) in July 2015. Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nTable 209: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>564,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>370,798\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>47,379\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>41,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>611,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>376,243\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $490.9 million and $196.6 million, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015, which accounted for $382.4 million of selling, general and administrative expenses in the 2016 period compared to $118.1 million for the comparable period of 2015. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2016 included costs related to the launch of Rayaldee. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 are $17.9 million of severance costs for certain Bio-Reference executives.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, include equity-based compensation expense of $33.4 million and $17.4 million, respectively. The increase in equity-based compensation expense is due to additional options grants made in 2016 and $8.9 million of expense related to the acceleration of stock option vesting for certain Bio-Reference executives.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $111.2 million and $99.5 million, respectively. Research and development costs include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We track external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and PMA's (pre-market approval) for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses: Table 210: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>External expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Phase 3 clinical trials\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing expense for biological products\n</td> <td>35,985\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earlier-stage programs\n</td> <td>6,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development employee-related expenses\n</td> <td>28,676\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other internal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>30,752\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party grants and funding from collaboration agreements\n</td> <td>(2,666\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, is due to an increase in research and development expenses related to hGH-CTP, a long acting human growth hormone which was outlicensed to Pfizer in 2015, and to an increase in research and development expenses for Factor VIIa-CTP. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also include $8.8 million from the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively, compared to $4.1 million for the comparable period of 2015. This was partially offset by decreased expenses incurred by OPKO Renal related to the development of Rayaldee. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded, as an offset to research and development expenses, $2.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to research and development grants received from our collaboration and funding agreements. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include equity-based compensation expenses of $7.5 million and $7.9 million, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to expand our research and development of potential future products.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $17.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The increase in contingent consideration is attributable to OPKO Renal resulting from an increase in the fair value of our contingent obligations due to changes in assumptions regarding the timing of successful achievement of future milestones driven by the FDA approval of Rayaldee in June 2016. The contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2016 relate to potential amounts payable to former stockholders of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal pursuant to our acquisition agreements in January 2011, October 2011, August 2012 and March 2013, respectively.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $64.4 million and $28.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 also includes $8.0 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets for Rayaldee. Upon the FDA's approval of Rayaldee in June 2016, we reclassified $187.6 million of IPR&D related to Rayaldee from In-process research and development to Intangible assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and began to amortize that asset. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $43.2 million and $2.5 million from Bio-Reference and EirGen which we acquired in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively, compared to $14.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for the comparable period of 2015. Our IPR&D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, the IPR&D assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.\nGrant repayment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a payment of $25.9 million to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy ( OCS\u201d) in connection with repayment obligations resulting from grants previously made by the OCS to OPKO Biologics to support development of hGH-CTP and the outlicense of the technology outside of Israel. We did not have any such activity for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest income. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was not significant as our cash investment strategy emphasizes the security of the principal invested and fulfillment of liquidity needs.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $7.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Interest expense is principally related to interest incurred on the 2033 Senior Notes including amortization of related deferred financing costs and to the interest incurred on Bio-Reference's outstanding debt under its credit facility. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to a decrease in the average principal amount of the 2033 Senior Notes outstanding in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 also reflects\na non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million as interest expense related to the exchange of $55.4 million principal of 2033 Senior Notes in 2015. This was partially offset by interest incurred on Bio-Reference's outstanding debt under its credit facility for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $2.8 million of income and $39.1 million of expense, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net related to non-cash income (expense) reflects the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in the 2033 Senior Notes of $7.0 million and $(36.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 also reflects $4.2 million of expense related to the change in the fair value of warrants and options to purchase additional shares of Neovasc, Cocrystal Pharma, Inc., ARNO Therapeutics, Inc. and MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\nOther income and (expense), net. Other income and (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $3.9 million and $7.7 million of income, respectively. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consists of a $2.5 million gain recognized in connection with the merger of STI and VBI Vaccines Inc., a $5.0 million gain recognized in connection with the settlement of a legal matter and foreign currency transaction gains recognized during the period, which was partially offset by a $4.8 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investments in Xenetic, ARNO and RXi down to their respective fair values. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consists of a $15.9 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of STI in 2015 which was partially offset by a $7.3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investment in RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation down to its fair value.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $56.1 million, and $113.7 million, respectively. The change in income taxes is primarily due to a $93.4 million release of OPKO's valuation allowance in 2015 on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the merger with Bio-Reference and to changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses. In addition, income taxes in 2016 benefited from a favorable corporate tax rate reduction in Israel.\nLoss from investments in investees. We have made investments in other early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for us as a shareholder or member. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate share of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees' technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipate they will continue to report a net loss. Loss from investments in investees was $7.7 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nFor The Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $400.6 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $321.9 million of the year-over-year revenue growth. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 211: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from services\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>329,739\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,666\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>321,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from products\n</td> <td>80,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,163\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from transfer of intellectual property and other\n</td> <td>81,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>491,738\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>91,125\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in Revenue from services was attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in Revenue from products principally reflected $12.1 million of revenue from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $8.7 million, and decreased revenue from STI, a VIE we deconsolidated in July 2015. The increase in Revenue from transfer of intellectual property principally reflected $65.5 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction and $15.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee TESARO in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $5.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee TESARO in 2014.\nCosts of revenue. Costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $187.2 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $183.3 million of the year-over-year cost of revenue growth. Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>41,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in cost of service revenue was attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in cost of product revenue principally reflected cost of revenue of $6.8 million from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, which was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $5.2 million and the deconsolidation of STI in July 2015.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $196.6 million and $57.9 million, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in 2015, which recognized $118.1 million and $1.8 million of selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015, respectively, increased personnel expenses as we expand our sales, marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure, and an increase in professional fees attributable to our acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, included bad debt expense of $24.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and equity-based compensation expense of $17.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively. The increase in bad debt expense was due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference. The increase in equity-based compensation expense was due to additional options grants made in 2015 and fluctuations in the price of our common stock.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $99.5 million and $83.6 million, respectively. Research and development costs included external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses included clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We tracked external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and PMA's (pre-market approval) for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses were incurred to support overall research and development activities and included expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses: Table 213: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>External expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Phase 3 clinical trials\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Manufacturing expense for biological products\n</td> <td>31,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,692\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earlier-stage programs\n</td> <td>6,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,093\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development employee-related expenses\n</td> <td>27,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,642\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other internal research and development expenses\n</td> <td>24,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,982\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party grants and funding from collaboration agreements\n</td> <td>(2,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,350\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>99,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to a $16.7 million increase in research and development expenses related to hGH-CTP, a long acting human growth hormone which was outlicensed to Pfizer in 2015, including manufacturing expense for biological products, and the recognition of $2.3 million of expense for our NDA submission to the FDA for oral Rayaldee in May 2015. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 also included $4.1 million from the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively. This was partially offset by decreased expenses incurred by OPKO Renal related to phase 3 clinical trials for Rayaldee, which were completed in 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded, as an offset to research and development expenses, $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to research and development grants received from our collaboration and funding agreements. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included equity-based compensation expense of $7.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively.\nIn-Process Research and Development. In May 2014, we acquired Inspiro in a stock for stock transaction. We recorded the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded the assets and liabilities at fair value, and as a result, we recorded $10.1 million of acquired in-process research and development expense. In addition, pursuant to our agreement with Merck & Co. ( Merck\u201d), we were required to make a $2.0 million payment upon the achievement of a milestone for VARUBI\u2122 which was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014. The agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the entire $2.0 million milestone payment was allocated to in-process research and development expense. No In-process research and development expense was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $5.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. The decrease in contingent consideration expense was attributable to OPKO Renal resulting from an increase in the fair value of our contingent obligations to OPKO Renal in 2014 due to changes in assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of future milestones driven by the two successful phase 3 trials of Rayaldee in 2014. The contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2015 related to potential amounts payable to former stockholders of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal pursuant to our acquisition agreements in January 2011, October 2011, August 2012 and March 2013, respectively.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $28.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Amortization expense reflected the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $14.6 million and $1.7 million from Bio-Reference and EirGen which we acquired in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively. Our IPR&D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, the IPR&D assets will then be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.\nGrant repayment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a payment of $25.9 million to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy ( OCS\u201d) in connection with repayment obligations resulting from grants previously made by the OCS to OPKO Biologics to support development of hGH-CTP and the outlicense of the technology outside of Israel.\nInterest income. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was not significant as our cash investment strategy emphasizes the security of the principal invested and fulfillment of liquidity needs.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $8.4 million and $12.3 million, respectively. Interest expense was principally related to interest incurred on the 2033 Senior Notes and the amortization of related deferred financing costs. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was due to a decrease in the principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes outstanding from $87.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $32.2 million as of December 31, 2015. This was partially offset by interest expense of $1.9 million from Bio-Reference due to outstanding debt under their credit facility. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also reflected non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million and $1.5 million as interest expense related to exchange or conversion of $55.4 million and $70.4 million principal of 2033 Senior Notes during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $39.1 million and $10.6 million of expense, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net principally related to non-cash expense related to the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in the 2033 Senior Notes of $36.6 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nOther income and (expense), net. Other income and (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $7.7 million of income and $3.1 million of expense, respectively. The increase in other income and (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $15.9 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of STI in the third quarter of 2015. This was partially offset by a $7.3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investment in RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation down to its fair value of $0.9 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a $1.4 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to our investment in ARNO Therapeutics in 2014.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our income tax benefit was due to a $93.4 million release of OPKO's valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the merger with Bio-Reference. This was partially offset by expense recognized on taxable income from the Pfizer Transaction during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our income tax benefit (provision) reflected the projected income tax payable in the U.S., Ireland, Israel, Chile, Spain, Mexico, and Luxembourg.\nLoss from investments in investees. We have made investments in other early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for us as a shareholder or member. We accounted for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate share of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees' technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipated they would continue to report a net loss. Loss from investments in investees was $7.1 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated STI, and account for our retained interest in STI as an equity method investment.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $168.7 million. Cash provided by operations during 2016 principally reflects a $50.0 million upfront payment received from the VFMCRP Agreement, our operations at Bio-Reference, and a $39.4 million payment received from the Internal Revenue Service for a change in accounting method, partially offset by expenses related to general and administrative activities related to our corporate operations, research and development activities and our launch activities related to Rayaldee. Cash used in investing activities primarily reflects capital expenditures of $18.5 million, investments of $14.4 million and acquisitions of intangible assets of $5.0 million, partially offset by cash acquired in the acquisition of Transition Therapeutics of $15.9 million. Cash used in financing activities primarily reflects net repayments on lines of credit of $43.8 million, partially offset by $8.6 million received from Common Stock option and Common Stock warrant exercises. We have not generated sustained positive cash flow sufficient to offset our operating and other expenses and our primary source of cash has been from the public and private placement of stock, the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes and credit facilities available to us.\nIn November 2016, we launched commercial sales for Rayaldee in the U.S. market. The FDA approved Rayaldee extended release capsules in June 2016 for the treatment of SHPT in adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. We have a highly specialized sales and marketing team dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee, and we expect to increase the sales and marketing team in the second half of 2017 as market access improves and prescription trends increase.\nIn August 2016, we completed the acquisition of Transition Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotechnology company. Holders of Transition Therapeutics common stock received 6,431,899 shares of OPKO Common Stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $58.5 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $9.10 as reported by NASDAQ on the closing date.\nIn May 2016, EirGen, our wholly-owned subsidiary, partnered with VFMCRP through a Development and License Agreement for the development and marketing of Rayaldee in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea and certain other international markets. The license to VFMCRP potentially covers all therapeutic and prophylactic uses of the product in human patients, provided that initially the license is for the use of the product for the treatment or prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism related to patients with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (\"Initial Indication\"). We received a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payment of $50 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $232 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments or a minimum royalty, whichever is greater, upon commencement of sales of the product.\nAs part of the arrangement, the companies will share responsibility for the conduct of trials specified within an agreed-upon development plan, with each company leading certain activities within the plan. For the initial development plan , the companies have agreed to certain cost sharing arrangements. VFMCRP will be responsible for all other development costs that VFMCRP considers necessary to develop the product for the Initial Indication in the Territory except as otherwise provided in the VFMCRP Agreement. EirGen also granted to VFMCRP an option to acquire an exclusive license to use, import, offer for sale, sell, distribute and commercialize the product in the United States for treatment of SHPT in dialysis patients with stage 5 CKD and vitamin D insufficiency (the \"Dialysis Indication\") Upon exercise of the Option, VFMCRP will reimburse EirGen for all of the development costs incurred by EirGen with respect to the product for the Dialysis Indication in the United States. VFMCRP would also pay EirGen up to an additional aggregate amount of $555 million upon the achievement of certain milestones and would be obligated to pay double digit royalties on VFMCRP's sales in the United States for the Dialysis Indication.\nIn January 2015, we partnered with Pfizer through a worldwide agreement for the development and commercialization of our long-acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of GHD in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born SGA. Under the terms of the agreements with Pfizer, we received non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payments of $295.0 million in the first quarter of 2015 and are eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Pfizer received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide. In addition, we are eligible to receive initial tiered royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD with percentage rates ranging from the high teens to mid-twenties. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD in certain major markets, the royalties will transition to regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and Pfizer's Genotropin\u00ae.\nWe will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, which includes Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. Pfizer will be responsible for all development costs for additional indications as well as all post-marketing studies. In addition, Pfizer will fund the commercialization activities for all\nindications and lead the manufacturing activities covered by the global development plan. In December 2016, we announced preliminary topline data from our Phase 3, double blind, placebo controlled study of hGH-CTP in adults with GHD. Although there was no statistically significant difference between hGH-CTP and placebo on the primary endpoint of change in trunk fat mass from baseline to 26 weeks, after unblinding the study, we identified an exceptional value of trunk fat mass reduction in the placebo group that may have affected the primary outcome. We believe the exceptional data point warrants an outlier sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint and related secondary endpoints. Upon completion of the data sensitivity analysis, we plan to discuss the study results and outlier analysis with the regulatory authorities to determine next steps in obtaining regulatory approval.\nIn August 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bio-Reference, the third largest full service clinical laboratory in the United States, known for its innovative technological solutions and pioneering leadership in the areas of genomics and genetic sequencing. Holders of Bio-Reference common stock received 76,566,147 shares of OPKO Common Stock for the outstanding shares of Bio-Reference common stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $950.1 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $12.38 as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, or $34.05 per share of Bio-Reference common stock. Included in the transaction value is $2.3 million related to the value of replacement stock option awards attributable to pre-merger service.\nIn May 2015, we entered into a series of purchase agreements to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of EirGen, a specialty pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products, for $133.8 million. We acquired the outstanding shares of EirGen for approximately $100.2 million in cash and delivered 2,420,487 shares of our Common Stock valued at approximately $33.6 million based on the closing price per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the closing date of the acquisition, $13.88 per share.\nWe plan to construct a research, development and manufacturing center in Waterford, Ireland, for which we expect to incur between $30 million and $40 million for the construction and validation of the facility with expenditures beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expected completion in 2019. Currently, we plan to fund the project from cash on hand or from third party funding sources that may be available to us.\nOur licensee, TESARO, received approval by the U.S. FDA in September 2015 for oral VARUBI\u2122, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In November 2015, TESARO announced the commercial launch of VARUBI\u2122 in the United States. We are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $30.0 million (of which $20.0 million has been received to date) upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sale milestones and additional commercial milestone payments of up to $85.0 million if specified levels of annual net sales are achieved. TESARO is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties on annual net sales achieved in the United States and Europe at percentage rates that range from the low double digits to the low twenties, and outside of the United States and Europe at low double-digit percentage rates.\n2033 Senior Notes. In January 2013, we issued $175.0 million of the 2033 Senior Notes. The 2033 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. At December 31, 2016, $31.9 million principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes was outstanding.\nOn January 3, 2017, we announced that our 2033 Senior Notes continue to be convertible by holders of such 2033 Senior Notes through March 31, 2017. We have elected to satisfy the conversion obligation in shares of our Common Stock. This conversion right has been extended because the closing price per share of our Common Stock has exceeded $9.19, or 130% of the applicable conversion price of $7.07, for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during the quarter ended on December 31, 2016. The 2033 Senior Notes will continue to be convertible until March 31, 2017, and may be convertible thereafter, if one or more of the conversion conditions specified in the Indenture is satisfied during future measurement periods. Pursuant to the Indenture, a holder who elects to convert the 2033 Senior Notes will receive 141.4827 shares of our Common Stock plus such number of additional shares as is applicable on the conversion date per $1,000 principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes based on the early conversion provisions in the Indenture.\nIn connection with our acquisitions of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal, we agreed to pay future consideration to the sellers upon the achievement of certain events, including up to an additional $19.1 million in shares of our Common Stock to the former stockholders of OPKO Diagnostics upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones; and up to an additional $125.0 million in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option subject to the achievement of certain milestones, to the former shareholders of OPKO Renal.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we also satisfied a $25.0 million contingent payment to the former owners of OPKO Renal through the issuance of 2,611,648 shares of our common stock in 2016.\nOn November 5, 2015, Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( CB\u201d), as lender and administrative agent, as amended (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $175.0 million secured revolving credit facility and includes a $20.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans and a $20.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit. Bio-Reference may increase the credit facility to up to $275.0 million on a secured basis, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. The Credit Agreement matures on November 5, 2020 and is guaranteed by all of Bio-Reference's domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement is also secured by substantially all assets of Bio-Reference and its domestic subsidiaries, as well as a non-recourse pledge by us of our equity interest in Bio-Reference. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivables of Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries, as specified therein. The proceeds of the new credit facility were used to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes of Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the total availability under our Credit Agreement with CB and our lines of credit with financial institutions in Chile and Spain was $151.9 million, of which $47.3 million was used and outstanding at December 31, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on these lines of credit is approximately 4.7%. These lines of credit are short-term and are used primarily as a source of working capital. The highest balance at any time during the year ended December 31, 2016, was $83.5 million. We intend to continue to enter into these lines of credit as needed. There is no assurance that these lines of credit or other funding sources will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses, including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales, marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure.\nWe believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2016, and the amounts available to be borrowed under our lines of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next 12 months. We based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change, and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect. If we acquire additional assets or companies, accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials, we will need additional funds. Our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our relationship with Pfizer, success of the commercial launch of Rayaldee, Bio-Reference's financial performance, possible acquisitions, the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing, and our success in developing markets for our product candidates. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or possible acquisitions.\nThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2016, with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by period.\nTable 214: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual obligations\n(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Open purchase orders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>90,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,751\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,967\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,137\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2033 Senior Notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgages and other debts payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>362\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>356\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>981\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,771\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lines of credit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,512\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,321\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest commitments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,082\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,011\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,401\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,725\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>262,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable, including the following:\n- Contractual obligations in connection with clinical trials, which span over two years, and that depend on patient enrollment. The total amount of expenditures is dependent on the actual number of patients enrolled and as such, the contracts do not specify the maximum amount we may owe.\n- Product license agreements effective during the lesser of 15 years or patent expiration whereby payments and amounts are determined by applying a royalty rate on uncapped future sales.\n- Contingent consideration that includes payments upon achievement of certain milestones including meeting development milestones such as the completion of successful clinical trials, NDA approvals by the FDA and revenue milestones upon the achievement of certain revenue targets all of which are anticipated to be paid within the next seven years and are payable in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option, and that may aggregate up to $159.4 million.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nAccounting estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nGoodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets, including IPR&D, acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, representing approximately 76% and 78% of total assets, respectively.\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, licensing and other transactions are generally recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. We determined the fair value of intangible assets, including IPR&D, using the income method.\u201d This method starts with a forecast of net cash flows, risk adjusted for estimated probabilities of technical and regulatory success (for IPR&D) and adjusted to present value using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk associated with the cash flow streams. All assets are valued from a market participant view which might be different than our specific views. The valuation process is very complex and requires significant input and judgment using internal and external sources. Although a valuation is required to be finalized within a one-year period, it must consider all and only those facts and evidence which existed at the acquisition date. The most complex and judgmental matters applicable to the valuation process are summarized below:\nTable 215: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Unit of account - Most intangible assets are valued as single global assets rather than multiple assets for each jurisdiction or indication after considering the development stage, expected levels of incremental costs to obtain additional approvals, risks associated with further development, amount and timing of benefits expected to be derived in the future, expected patent lives in various jurisdictions and the intention to promote the asset as a global brand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 216: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Estimated useful life - The asset life expected to contribute meaningful cash flows is determined after considering all pertinent matters associated with the asset, including expected regulatory approval dates (if unapproved), exclusivity periods and other legal, regulatory or contractual provisions as well as the effects of any obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors, including barriers to entry.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 217: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Probability of Technical and Regulatory Success ( PTRS\u201d) Rate - PTRS rates are determined based upon industry averages considering the respective program's development stage and disease indication and adjusted for specific information or data known at the acquisition date. Subsequent clinical results or other internal or external data obtained could alter the PTRS rate and materially impact the estimated fair value of the intangible asset in subsequent periods leading to impairment charges.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Projections - Future revenues are estimated after considering many factors such as initial market opportunity, pricing, sales trajectories to peak sales levels, competitive environment and product evolution. Future costs and expenses are estimated after considering historical market trends, market participant synergies and the timing and level of additional development costs to obtain the initial or additional regulatory approvals, maintain or further enhance the product. We generally assume initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals which typically may not occur for a number of years. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than those assumed since projections are subjected to multiple factors including trial results and regulatory matters which could materially change the ultimate commercial success of the asset as well as significantly alter the costs to develop the respective asset into commercially viable products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Tax rates - The expected future income is tax effected using a market participant tax rate. In determining the tax rate, we consider the jurisdiction in which the intellectual property is held and location of research and manufacturing infrastructure. We also consider that any repatriation of earnings would likely have U.S. tax consequences.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Discount rate - Discount rates are selected after considering the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Goodwill was $704.6 million and $743.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. Examples of qualitative factors include our share price, our\nfinancial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test previously performed. No goodwill impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our testing. We recorded $87 thousand of goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of our testing.\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our testing. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nIntangible assets, net were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, including IPR&D of $644.7 million and $792.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, although IPR&D is required to be tested at least annually until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon obtaining regulatory approval, the IPR&D asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset is charged to expense.\nIntangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products and IPR&D. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation.\nConsidering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry's success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPR&D impairment charges are likely to occur in future periods. IPR&D is closely monitored and assessed each period for impairment.\nWe amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20 years. We use the straight-line method of amortization as there is no reliably determinable pattern in which the economic benefits of our intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. Amortization expense was $64.4 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRevenue recognition. Revenue for laboratory services is recognized at the time test results are reported, which approximates when services are provided. Services are provided to patients covered by various third-party payer programs including various managed care organizations, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Billings for services under third-party payer programs are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances for differences between the amounts billed and estimated program payment amounts. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts based on final settlement with the programs are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 16% and 9%, respectively, of our revenues from services were derived directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The increase in revenues from laboratory services, including revenue from Medicare and Medicaid programs, is due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, collectability is reasonably assured, and the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, which is generally when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers. Our estimates for sales returns and allowances are based upon the historical patterns of product returns and allowances taken, matched against the sales from which they originated, and our evaluation of specific factors that may increase or decrease the risk of product returns. Product revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, co-pay assistance and other deductions (collectively, \"Sales Deductions\") as well as estimated product returns. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenues are recognized.\nWe launched Rayaldee in the U.S. through our dedicated renal sales force in November 2016. Rayaldee is distributed in the U.S. principally through the retail pharmacy channel, which initiates with the largest wholesalers in the U.S. (collectively, \"Rayaldee Customers\"). In addition to distribution agreements with Rayaldee Customers, we have entered into arrangements with many health care providers and payers that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of Rayaldee.\nWe lack the experiential data which would allow us to estimate Sales Deductions and returns. Therefore, as of December 31, 2016, we have determined that we do not yet meet the criteria for the recognition of revenue for shipments of Rayaldee at the time of shipment to Rayaldee Customers as allowances for Sales Deductions and returns are not known or cannot be reasonably estimated. We will not recognize revenue upon shipment until such time as we can reasonably estimate and record provisions for Sales Deductions and returns utilizing historical information and market research projections.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not recognize any product revenues related to Rayaldee sales. Payments received from Rayaldee Customers in advance of recognition of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue included in Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The related deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2016 was $1.6 million. The corresponding costs of product revenues for which we have not recognized product revenue have similarly not yet been reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property includes revenue related to the sale, license or transfer of intellectual property such as upfront license payments, license fees, milestone and royalty payments received through our license, and collaboration and commercialization agreements. We analyze our multiple-element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting.\nNon-refundable license fees for the out-license of our technology are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement. We recognize non-refundable upfront license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and qualifies for treatment as a separate unit of accounting under multiple-element arrangement guidance. License fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations that do not have standalone value are recorded as deferred revenue, included in Accrued expenses or Other long-term liabilities, when received and generally are recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligations only after both the license period has commenced and we have delivered the technology.\nThe assessment of our obligations and related performance periods requires significant management judgment. If an agreement contains research and development obligations, the relevant time period for the research and development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process. Such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized, and as a result, management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of research and development on a periodic basis.\nRevenue from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payments are non-refundable; there was substantive uncertainty at the date of entering into the arrangement that the milestone would be achieved; the milestone payment is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item by us; the milestone relates solely to past performance; and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, the milestone payments are not considered to be substantive and are, therefore, deferred and recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations.\nConcentration of credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Substantially all of our accounts receivable are with either companies in the health care industry or patients. However, credit risk is limited due to the number of our clients as well as their dispersion across many different geographic regions.\nWhile we have receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, we do not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related health care programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent upon submitting appropriate documentation. Accounts receivable balances (net of contractual adjustments) from Medicare and Medicaid were $50.5 million and $26.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe portion of our accounts receivable due from individual patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, receivables due from patients represent approximately 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively, of our consolidated accounts receivable (prior to allowance for doubtful accounts).\nWe assess the collectability of accounts receivable balances by considering factors such as historical collection experience, customer credit worthiness, the age of accounts receivable balances, regulatory changes and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our reported net income (loss) is directly affected by our estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $36.3 million and $25.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nIncome taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. Our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment.\nEquity-based compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We record excess tax benefits, realized from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash inflow and as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations. Equity-based compensation arrangements to non-employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of equity-based compensation to non-employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest. We estimate the grant-date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the Black-Scholes-Merton formula or the Black-Scholes Model.\u201d The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options including expected term, expected volatility, expected dividends and risk-free interest rate. We perform analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Model and to estimate forfeitures of equity-based awards. We are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share-based awards that ultimately vest. The selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates which may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand, estimated time required to sell such inventories, remaining shelf-life, and current market conditions to determine whether inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories at our diagnostics segment consist primarily of purchased laboratory supplies, which is used in our testing laboratories.\nPre-launch inventories. We may accumulate commercial quantities of certain product candidates prior to the date we anticipate that such products will receive final U.S. FDA approval. The accumulation of such pre-launch inventories involves the risk that such products may not be approved for marketing by the FDA on a timely basis, or ever. This risk notwithstanding, we may accumulate pre-launch inventories of certain products when such action is appropriate in relation to the commercial value of the product launch opportunity. In accordance with our policy, this pre-launch inventory is expensed.\nContingent consideration. Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain prior acquisitions to their fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and decreases in the fair value as a reduction in contingent consideration expense. Changes in contingent consideration result from changes in the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones, the estimated timing in which the milestones are achieved and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability. Contingent consideration may change significantly as our development programs progress, revenue estimates evolve and additional data is obtained, impacting our assumptions. The assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value which may have a material impact on our results from operations and financial position.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecent accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards that removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements, provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies can choose to apply the ASU using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating both methods of adoption and the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).\u201d ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 was effective for the Company beginning after January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2014-12 in the first quarter of 2016 using the prospective application did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d to provide guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. Our adoption of ASU 2014-15 in the fourth quarter of 2016 did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,\u201d which amends current consolidation guidance including changes to both the variable and voting interest models used by companies to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated. The requirements from ASU 2015-02 were effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2015-02 in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d which changes the measurement principle for entities that do not measure inventory using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) or retail inventory method from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,\u201d which replaces the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively with a requirement that an acquirer recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Our early adoption of ASU 2015-16 in 2015 did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. We early adopted the provisions of this ASU prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015, and did not retrospectively adjust the prior periods. The adoption of this ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes and reduces complexity without decreasing the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10),\u201d which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which will require organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. The ASU will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718),\u201d which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and accounting for forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),\u201d which addresses the classification of eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350),\u201d which simplifies how an entity is required to test for goodwill impairment. ASU 2017-04 will be effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.", "item_7_truncated": "The assessment of our obligations and related performance periods requires significant management judgment.

The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015, which accounted for $382.4 million of selling, general and administrative expenses in the 2016 period compared to $118.1 million for the comparable period of 2015. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2016 included costs related to the launch of Rayaldee. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 are $17.9 million of severance costs for certain Bio-Reference executives.\nTable 212: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of Revenue\n</td> <td>For the year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of service revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>193,305\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,372\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>183,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenue\n</td> <td>41,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>235,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,230\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \u2022 Tax rates - The expected future income is tax effected using a market participant tax rate.

Rayaldee is distributed in the U.S. principally through the retail pharmacy channel, which initiates with the largest wholesalers in the U.S. (collectively, \"Rayaldee Customers\"). In addition to distribution agreements with Rayaldee Customers, we have entered into arrangements with many health care providers and payers that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of Rayaldee.\n- Contractual obligations in connection with clinical trials, which span over two years, and that depend on patient enrollment. The total amount of expenditures is dependent on the actual number of patients enrolled and as such, the contracts do not specify the maximum amount we may owe.\nLoss from investments in investees. We have made investments in other early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for us as a shareholder or member. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate share of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees' technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipate they will continue to report a net loss. Loss from investments in investees was $7.7 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGrant repayment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a payment of $25.9 million to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy ( OCS\u201d) in connection with repayment obligations resulting from grants previously made by the OCS to OPKO Biologics to support development of hGH-CTP and the outlicense of the technology outside of Israel.\n\nIn May 2015, we entered into a series of purchase agreements to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of EirGen, a specialty pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products, for $133.8 million. We acquired the outstanding shares of EirGen for approximately $100.2 million in cash and delivered 2,420,487 shares of our Common Stock valued at approximately $33.6 million based on the closing price per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the closing date of the acquisition, $13.88 per share.\nOther income and (expense), net. Other income and (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $3.9 million and $7.7 million of income, respectively. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consists of a $2.5 million gain recognized in connection with the merger of STI and VBI Vaccines Inc., a $5.0 million gain recognized in connection with the settlement of a legal matter and foreign currency transaction gains recognized during the period, which was partially offset by a $4.8 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investments in Xenetic, ARNO and RXi down to their respective fair values. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consists of a $15.9 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of STI in 2015 which was partially offset by a $7.3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investment in RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation down to its fair value.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. We early adopted the provisions of this ASU prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015, and did not retrospectively adjust the prior periods. The adoption of this ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes and reduces complexity without decreasing the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not recognize any product revenues related to Rayaldee sales. Payments received from Rayaldee Customers in advance of recognition of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue included in Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The related deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2016 was $1.6 million. The corresponding costs of product revenues for which we have not recognized product revenue have similarly not yet been reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n \u2022 Discount rate - Discount rates are selected after considering the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset.  Goodwill was $704.6 million and $743.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. Examples of qualitative factors include our share price, our\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property includes revenue related to the sale, license or transfer of intellectual property such as upfront license payments, license fees, milestone and royalty payments received through our license, and collaboration and commercialization agreements. We analyze our multiple-element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting.\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $400.6 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $321.9 million of the year-over-year revenue growth. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n- Contingent consideration that includes payments upon achievement of certain milestones including meeting development milestones such as the completion of successful clinical trials, NDA approvals by the FDA and revenue milestones upon the achievement of certain revenue targets all of which are anticipated to be paid within the next seven years and are payable in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option, and that may aggregate up to $159.4 million.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( PSLRA\u201d), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act\u201d), about our expectations, beliefs, or intentions regarding our product development efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies, or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends, or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbor provisions of PSLRA. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance.\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $729.9 million compared to the prior year. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRevenue recognition. Revenue for laboratory services is recognized at the time test results are reported, which approximates when services are provided. Services are provided to patients covered by various third-party payer programs including various managed care organizations, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Billings for services under third-party payer programs are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances for differences between the amounts billed and estimated program payment amounts. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts based on final settlement with the programs are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 16% and 9%, respectively, of our revenues from services were derived directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The increase in revenues from laboratory services, including revenue from Medicare and Medicaid programs, is due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015.\nContingent consideration. Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain prior acquisitions to their fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and decreases in the fair value as a reduction in contingent consideration expense. Changes in contingent consideration result from changes in the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones, the estimated timing in which the milestones are achieved and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability. Contingent consideration may change significantly as our development programs progress, revenue estimates evolve and additional data is obtained, impacting our assumptions. The assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value which may have a material impact on our results from operations and financial position.\nindications and lead the manufacturing activities covered by the global development plan. In December 2016, we announced preliminary topline data from our Phase 3, double blind, placebo controlled study of hGH-CTP in adults with GHD. Although there was no statistically significant difference between hGH-CTP and placebo on the primary endpoint of change in trunk fat mass from baseline to 26 weeks, after unblinding the study, we identified an exceptional value of trunk fat mass reduction in the placebo group that may have affected the primary outcome. We believe the exceptional data point warrants an outlier sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint and related secondary endpoints. Upon completion of the data sensitivity analysis, we plan to discuss the study results and outlier analysis with the regulatory authorities to determine next steps in obtaining regulatory approval.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we also satisfied a $25.0 million contingent payment to the former owners of OPKO Renal through the issuance of 2,611,648 shares of our common stock in 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nIn January 2015, we partnered with Pfizer through a worldwide agreement for the development and commercialization of our long-acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of GHD in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born SGA. Under the terms of the agreements with Pfizer, we received non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payments of $295.0 million in the first quarter of 2015 and are eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Pfizer received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide. In addition, we are eligible to receive initial tiered royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD with percentage rates ranging from the high teens to mid-twenties. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD in certain major markets, the royalties will transition to regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and Pfizer's Genotropin\u00ae.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d which changes the measurement principle for entities that do not measure inventory using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) or retail inventory method from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $5.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. The decrease in contingent consideration expense was attributable to OPKO Renal resulting from an increase in the fair value of our contingent obligations to OPKO Renal in 2014 due to changes in assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of future milestones driven by the two successful phase 3 trials of Rayaldee in 2014. The contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2015 related to potential amounts payable to former stockholders of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal pursuant to our acquisition agreements in January 2011, October 2011, August 2012 and March 2013, respectively.\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal, we agreed to pay future consideration to the sellers upon the achievement of certain events, including up to an additional $19.1 million in shares of our Common Stock to the former stockholders of OPKO Diagnostics upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones; and up to an additional $125.0 million in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option subject to the achievement of certain milestones, to the former shareholders of OPKO Renal.\nThe increase in Revenue from services is attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in Revenue from products principally reflects an increase in revenue from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, and an increase in revenue from OPKO Chile. Revenue from transfer of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2016 principally reflects $50.0 million of revenue from the initial payment in the VFMCRP Agreement and $70.6 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction. Revenue from transfer of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2015 principally reflects $65.5 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction and $15.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee, TESARO, in the fourth quarter of 2015. We are recognizing the non-refundable $295.0 million upfront payments received in the Pfizer Transaction on a straight-line basis over the expected performance period. The performance period is expected to continue through 2019, when we anticipate completing the various research and development services that are specified in the Pfizer Transaction.\nIn May 2016, EirGen, our wholly-owned subsidiary, partnered with VFMCRP through a Development and License Agreement for the development and marketing of Rayaldee in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea and certain other international markets. The license to VFMCRP potentially covers all therapeutic and prophylactic uses of the product in human patients, provided that initially the license is for the use of the product for the treatment or prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism related to patients with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (\"Initial Indication\"). We received a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payment of $50 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $232 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments or a minimum royalty, whichever is greater, upon commencement of sales of the product.\nOur licensee, TESARO, received approval by the U.S. FDA in September 2015 for oral VARUBITM, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In November 2015, TESARO announced the commercial launch of VARUBITM in the United States. We are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $30.0 million (of which $20.0 million has been received to date) upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sale milestones and additional commercial milestone payments of up to $85.0 million if specified levels of annual net sales are achieved. TESARO is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties on annual net sales achieved in the United States and Europe at percentage rates that range from the low double digits to the low twenties, and outside of the United States and Europe at low double-digit percentage rates.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the total availability under our Credit Agreement with CB and our lines of credit with financial institutions in Chile and Spain was $151.9 million, of which $47.3 million was used and outstanding at December 31, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on these lines of credit is approximately 4.7%. These lines of credit are short-term and are used primarily as a source of working capital. The highest balance at any time during the year ended December 31, 2016, was $83.5 million. We intend to continue to enter into these lines of credit as needed. There is no assurance that these lines of credit or other funding sources will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $111.2 million and $99.5 million, respectively. Research and development costs include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We track external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and PMA's (pre-market approval) for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $56.1 million, and $113.7 million, respectively. The change in income taxes is primarily due to a $93.4 million release of OPKO's valuation allowance in 2015 on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the merger with Bio-Reference and to changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses. In addition, income taxes in 2016 benefited from a favorable corporate tax rate reduction in Israel.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $7.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Interest expense is principally related to interest incurred on the 2033 Senior Notes including amortization of related deferred financing costs and to the interest incurred on Bio-Reference's outstanding debt under its credit facility. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to a decrease in the average principal amount of the 2033 Senior Notes outstanding in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 also reflects\nThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2016, with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by period.\n \u2022 Probability of Technical and Regulatory Success ( PTRS\u201d) Rate - PTRS rates are determined based upon industry averages considering the respective program's development stage and disease indication and adjusted for specific information or data known at the acquisition date. Subsequent clinical results or other internal or external data obtained could alter the PTRS rate and materially impact the estimated fair value of the intangible asset in subsequent periods leading to impairment charges. \nThe increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, is due to an increase in research and development expenses related to hGH-CTP, a long acting human growth hormone which was outlicensed to Pfizer in 2015, and to an increase in research and development expenses for Factor VIIa-CTP. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also include $8.8 million from the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively, compared to $4.1 million for the comparable period of 2015. This was partially offset by decreased expenses incurred by OPKO Renal related to the development of Rayaldee. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded, as an offset to research and development expenses, $2.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to research and development grants received from our collaboration and funding agreements. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include equity-based compensation expenses of $7.5 million and $7.9 million, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to expand our research and development of potential future products.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our income tax benefit was due to a $93.4 million release of OPKO's valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the merger with Bio-Reference. This was partially offset by expense recognized on taxable income from the Pfizer Transaction during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our income tax benefit (provision) reflected the projected income tax payable in the U.S., Ireland, Israel, Chile, Spain, Mexico, and Luxembourg.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses, including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales, marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure.\nfinancial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test previously performed. No goodwill impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our testing. We recorded $87 thousand of goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of our testing.\nRevenue from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payments are non-refundable; there was substantive uncertainty at the date of entering into the arrangement that the milestone would be achieved; the milestone payment is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item by us; the milestone relates solely to past performance; and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, the milestone payments are not considered to be substantive and are, therefore, deferred and recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations.\nIn August 2016, we completed the acquisition of Transition Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotechnology company. Holders of Transition Therapeutics common stock received 6,431,899 shares of OPKO Common Stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $58.5 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $9.10 as reported by NASDAQ on the closing date.\nThe portion of our accounts receivable due from individual patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, receivables due from patients represent approximately 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively, of our consolidated accounts receivable (prior to allowance for doubtful accounts).\nGrant repayment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a payment of $25.9 million to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy ( OCS\u201d) in connection with repayment obligations resulting from grants previously made by the OCS to OPKO Biologics to support development of hGH-CTP and the outlicense of the technology outside of Israel. We did not have any such activity for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in Revenue from services was attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in Revenue from products principally reflected $12.1 million of revenue from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $8.7 million, and decreased revenue from STI, a VIE we deconsolidated in July 2015. The increase in Revenue from transfer of intellectual property principally reflected $65.5 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction and $15.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee TESARO in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $5.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee TESARO in 2014.\nFor The Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nIntangible assets, net were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, including IPR&D of $644.7 million and $792.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, although IPR&D is required to be tested at least annually until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon obtaining regulatory approval, the IPR&D asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset is charged to expense.\na non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million as interest expense related to the exchange of $55.4 million principal of 2033 Senior Notes in 2015. This was partially offset by interest incurred on Bio-Reference's outstanding debt under its credit facility for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $28.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Amortization expense reflected the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $14.6 million and $1.7 million from Bio-Reference and EirGen which we acquired in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively. Our IPR&D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, the IPR&D assets will then be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $99.5 million and $83.6 million, respectively. Research and development costs included external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses included clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We tracked external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and PMA's (pre-market approval) for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses were incurred to support overall research and development activities and included expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nIn August 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bio-Reference, the third largest full service clinical laboratory in the United States, known for its innovative technological solutions and pioneering leadership in the areas of genomics and genetic sequencing. Holders of Bio-Reference common stock received 76,566,147 shares of OPKO Common Stock for the outstanding shares of Bio-Reference common stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $950.1 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $12.38 as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, or $34.05 per share of Bio-Reference common stock. Included in the transaction value is $2.3 million related to the value of replacement stock option awards attributable to pre-merger service.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $8.4 million and $12.3 million, respectively. Interest expense was principally related to interest incurred on the 2033 Senior Notes and the amortization of related deferred financing costs. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was due to a decrease in the principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes outstanding from $87.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $32.2 million as of December 31, 2015. This was partially offset by interest expense of $1.9 million from Bio-Reference due to outstanding debt under their credit facility. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also reflected non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million and $1.5 million as interest expense related to exchange or conversion of $55.4 million and $70.4 million principal of 2033 Senior Notes during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn-Process Research and Development. In May 2014, we acquired Inspiro in a stock for stock transaction. We recorded the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded the assets and liabilities at fair value, and as a result, we recorded $10.1 million of acquired in-process research and development expense. In addition, pursuant to our agreement with Merck & Co. ( Merck\u201d), we were required to make a $2.0 million payment upon the achievement of a milestone for VARUBITM which was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014. The agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the entire $2.0 million milestone payment was allocated to in-process research and development expense. No In-process research and development expense was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nWe will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, which includes Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. Pfizer will be responsible for all development costs for additional indications as well as all post-marketing studies. In addition, Pfizer will fund the commercialization activities for all\nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. Our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRecent accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards that removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements, provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies can choose to apply the ASU using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating both methods of adoption and the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor The Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAccounting estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nThe increase in cost of service revenue was attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in cost of product revenue principally reflected cost of revenue of $6.8 million from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, which was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $5.2 million and the deconsolidation of STI in July 2015.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses: \nWe operate established pharmaceutical platforms in Spain, Ireland, Chile and Mexico, which are generating revenue and from which we expect to generate positive cash flow and facilitate future market entry for our products currently in development. EirGen, our specialty pharmaceutical manufacturing and development site in Ireland, is focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products. In addition, we operate a specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs\u201d) manufacturer in Israel, which we expect will facilitate the development of our pipeline of molecules and compounds for our proprietary products.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),\u201d which addresses the classification of eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs part of the arrangement, the companies will share responsibility for the conduct of trials specified within an agreed-upon development plan, with each company leading certain activities within the plan. For the initial development plan, the companies have agreed to certain cost sharing arrangements. VFMCRP will be responsible for all other development costs that VFMCRP considers necessary to develop the product for the Initial Indication in the Territory except as otherwise provided in the VFMCRP Agreement. EirGen also granted to VFMCRP an option to acquire an exclusive license to use, import, offer for sale, sell, distribute and commercialize the product in the United States for treatment of SHPT in dialysis patients with stage 5 CKD and vitamin D insufficiency (the \"Dialysis Indication\") Upon exercise of the Option, VFMCRP will reimburse EirGen for all of the development costs incurred by EirGen with respect to the product for the Dialysis Indication in the United States. VFMCRP would also pay EirGen up to an additional aggregate amount of $555 million upon the achievement of certain milestones and would be obligated to pay double digit royalties on VFMCRP's sales in the United States for the Dialysis Indication.\nConcentration of credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Substantially all of our accounts receivable are with either companies in the health care industry or patients. However, credit risk is limited due to the number of our clients as well as their dispersion across many different geographic regions.\nWe believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2016, and the amounts available to be borrowed under our lines of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next 12 months. We based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change, and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect. If we acquire additional assets or companies, accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials, we will need additional funds. Our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our relationship with Pfizer, success of the commercial launch of Rayaldee, Bio-Reference's financial performance, possible acquisitions, the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing, and our success in developing markets for our product candidates. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or possible acquisitions.\nThe preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable, including the following:\nIn November 2016, we launched commercial sales for Rayaldee in the U.S. market. The FDA approved Rayaldee extended release capsules in June 2016 for the treatment of SHPT in adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. We have a highly specialized sales and marketing team dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee, and we expect to increase the sales and marketing team in the second half of 2017 as market access improves and prescription trends increase.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,\u201d which replaces the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively with a requirement that an acquirer recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Our early adoption of ASU 2015-16 in 2015 did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand, estimated time required to sell such inventories, remaining shelf-life, and current market conditions to determine whether inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories at our diagnostics segment consist primarily of purchased laboratory supplies, which is used in our testing laboratories.\nWe amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20 years. We use the straight-line method of amortization as there is no reliably determinable pattern in which the economic benefits of our intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. Amortization expense was $64.4 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $17.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The increase in contingent consideration is attributable to OPKO Renal resulting from an increase in the fair value of our contingent obligations due to changes in assumptions regarding the timing of successful achievement of future milestones driven by the FDA approval of Rayaldee in June 2016. The contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2016 relate to potential amounts payable to former stockholders of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal pursuant to our acquisition agreements in January 2011, October 2011, August 2012 and March 2013, respectively.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $64.4 million and $28.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 also includes $8.0 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets for Rayaldee. Upon the FDA's approval of Rayaldee in June 2016, we reclassified $187.6 million of IPR&D related to Rayaldee from In-process research and development to Intangible assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and began to amortize that asset. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $43.2 million and $2.5 million from Bio-Reference and EirGen which we acquired in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively, compared to $14.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for the comparable period of 2015. Our IPR&D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, the IPR&D assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our testing. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d to provide guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. Our adoption of ASU 2014-15 in the fourth quarter of 2016 did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIntangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products and IPR&D. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation.\nPre-launch inventories. We may accumulate commercial quantities of certain product candidates prior to the date we anticipate that such products will receive final U.S. FDA approval. The accumulation of such pre-launch inventories involves the risk that such products may not be approved for marketing by the FDA on a timely basis, or ever. This risk notwithstanding, we may accumulate pre-launch inventories of certain products when such action is appropriate in relation to the commercial value of the product launch opportunity. In accordance with our policy, this pre-launch inventory is expensed.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, collectability is reasonably assured, and the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, which is generally when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers. Our estimates for sales returns and allowances are based upon the historical patterns of product returns and allowances taken, matched against the sales from which they originated, and our evaluation of specific factors that may increase or decrease the risk of product returns. Product revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, co-pay assistance and other deductions (collectively, \"Sales Deductions\") as well as estimated product returns. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenues are recognized.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,\u201d which amends current consolidation guidance including changes to both the variable and voting interest models used by companies to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated. The requirements from ASU 2015-02 were effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2015-02 in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income and (expense), net. Other income and (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $7.7 million of income and $3.1 million of expense, respectively. The increase in other income and (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $15.9 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of STI in the third quarter of 2015. This was partially offset by a $7.3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investment in RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation down to its fair value of $0.9 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a $1.4 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to our investment in ARNO Therapeutics in 2014.\nWe plan to construct a research, development and manufacturing center in Waterford, Ireland, for which we expect to incur between $30 million and $40 million for the construction and validation of the facility with expenditures beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expected completion in 2019. Currently, we plan to fund the project from cash on hand or from third party funding sources that may be available to us.\nEquity-based compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We record excess tax benefits, realized from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash inflow and as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations. Equity-based compensation arrangements to non-employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of equity-based compensation to non-employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest. We estimate the grant-date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the Black-Scholes-Merton formula or the Black-Scholes Model.\u201d The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options including expected term, expected volatility, expected dividends and risk-free interest rate. We perform analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Model and to estimate forfeitures of equity-based awards. We are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share-based awards that ultimately vest. The selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates which may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCosts of revenue. Costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $376.2 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $375.9 million of the increase in cost of service revenue. The increase in cost of product revenue is attributable to an increase in cost of revenue from EirGen and OPKO Chile, which was partially offset by the deconsolidation of SciVac Therapeutics Inc. ( STI\u201d) in July 2015. Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nIn November 2016, we launched commercial sales for Rayaldee in the U.S. market. The FDA approved Rayaldee extended release capsules in June 2016 for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. We have a highly specialized sales and marketing team dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee, and we expect to increase the sales and marketing team in the second half of 2017.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $2.8 million of income and $39.1 million of expense, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net related to non-cash income (expense) reflects the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in the 2033 Senior Notes of $7.0 million and $(36.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 also reflects $4.2 million of expense related to the change in the fair value of warrants and options to purchase additional shares of Neovasc, Cocrystal Pharma, Inc., ARNO Therapeutics, Inc. and MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\nOn January 3, 2017, we announced that our 2033 Senior Notes continue to be convertible by holders of such 2033 Senior Notes through March 31, 2017. We have elected to satisfy the conversion obligation in shares of our Common Stock. This conversion right has been extended because the closing price per share of our Common Stock has exceeded $9.19, or 130% of the applicable conversion price of $7.07, for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during the quarter ended on December 31, 2016. The 2033 Senior Notes will continue to be convertible until March 31, 2017, and may be convertible thereafter, if one or more of the conversion conditions specified in the Indenture is satisfied during future measurement periods. Pursuant to the Indenture, a holder who elects to convert the 2033 Senior Notes will receive 141.4827 shares of our Common Stock plus such number of additional shares as is applicable on the conversion date per $1,000 principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes based on the early conversion provisions in the Indenture.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $168.7 million. Cash provided by operations during 2016 principally reflects a $50.0 million upfront payment received from the VFMCRP Agreement, our operations at Bio-Reference, and a $39.4 million payment received from the Internal Revenue Service for a change in accounting method, partially offset by expenses related to general and administrative activities related to our corporate operations, research and development activities and our launch activities related to Rayaldee. Cash used in investing activities primarily reflects capital expenditures of $18.5 million, investments of $14.4 million and acquisitions of intangible assets of $5.0 million, partially offset by cash acquired in the acquisition of Transition Therapeutics of $15.9 million. Cash used in financing activities primarily reflects net repayments on lines of credit of $43.8 million, partially offset by $8.6 million received from Common Stock option and Common Stock warrant exercises. We have not generated sustained positive cash flow sufficient to offset our operating and other expenses and our primary source of cash has been from the public and private placement of stock, the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes and credit facilities available to us.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $39.1 million and $10.6 million of expense, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net principally related to non-cash expense related to the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in the 2033 Senior Notes of $36.6 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350),\u201d which simplifies how an entity is required to test for goodwill impairment. ASU 2017-04 will be effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nGoodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets, including IPR&D, acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, representing approximately 76% and 78% of total assets, respectively.\nCosts of revenue. Costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $187.2 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $183.3 million of the year-over-year cost of revenue growth. Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718),\u201d which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and accounting for forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest income. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was not significant as our cash investment strategy emphasizes the security of the principal invested and fulfillment of liquidity needs.\nOn November 5, 2015, Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( CB\u201d), as lender and administrative agent, as amended (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $175.0 million secured revolving credit facility and includes a $20.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans and a $20.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit. Bio-Reference may increase the credit facility to up to $275.0 million on a secured basis, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. The Credit Agreement matures on November 5, 2020 and is guaranteed by all of Bio-Reference's domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement is also secured by substantially all assets of Bio-Reference and its domestic subsidiaries, as well as a non-recourse pledge by us of our equity interest in Bio-Reference. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivables of Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries, as specified therein. The proceeds of the new credit facility were used to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes of Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries.\nInterest income. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was not significant as our cash investment strategy emphasizes the security of the principal invested and fulfillment of liquidity needs.\nWe are a diversified healthcare company that seeks to establish industry-leading positions in large and rapidly growing medical markets. Our diagnostics business includes Bio-Reference Laboratories ( Bio-Reference\u201d), the nation's third-largest clinical laboratory with a core genetic testing business and a 400-person sales and marketing team to drive growth and leverage new products, including the 4Kscore prostate cancer test and the Claros 1 in-office immunoassay platform (in development). Our pharmaceutical business features Rayaldee, an FDA-approved treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT\u201d) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease ( CKD\u201d) and vitamin D insufficiency (launched in November 2016), and VARUBITM for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (oral formulation launched by partner TESARO in November 2015 and pending approval for IV formulation), TT401, a once or twice weekly oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity which is a clinically advanced drug candidate among the new class of GLP-1 glucagon receptor dual agonists (Phase 2b), and TT701, an androgen receptor modulator for androgen deficiency indications. Our pharmaceutical business also features hGH-CTP, a once-weekly human growth hormone injection (in Phase 3 and partnered with Pfizer), a once-daily Factor VIIa drug for hemophilia (Phase 2a), and long-acting oxyntomodulin ( OXM\u201d) for diabetes and obesity (Phase 1).\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses: \n2033 Senior Notes. In January 2013, we issued $175.0 million of the 2033 Senior Notes. The 2033 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. At December 31, 2016, $31.9 million principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes was outstanding.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWhile we have receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, we do not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related health care programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent upon submitting appropriate documentation. Accounts receivable balances (net of contractual adjustments) from Medicare and Medicaid were $50.5 million and $26.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, licensing and other transactions are generally recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. We determined the fair value of intangible assets, including IPR&D, using the income method.\u201d This method starts with a forecast of net cash flows, risk adjusted for estimated probabilities of technical and regulatory success (for IPR&D) and adjusted to present value using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk associated with the cash flow streams. All assets are valued from a market participant view which might be different than our specific views. The valuation process is very complex and requires significant input and judgment using internal and external sources. Although a valuation is required to be finalized within a one-year period, it must consider all and only those facts and evidence which existed at the acquisition date. The most complex and judgmental matters applicable to the valuation process are summarized below:\n \u2022 Unit of account - Most intangible assets are valued as single global assets rather than multiple assets for each jurisdiction or indication after considering the development stage, expected levels of incremental costs to obtain additional approvals, risks associated with further development, amount and timing of benefits expected to be derived in the future, expected patent lives in various jurisdictions and the intention to promote the asset as a global brand. \nWe lack the experiential data which would allow us to estimate Sales Deductions and returns. Therefore, as of December 31, 2016, we have determined that we do not yet meet the criteria for the recognition of revenue for shipments of Rayaldee at the time of shipment to Rayaldee Customers as allowances for Sales Deductions and returns are not known or cannot be reasonably estimated. We will not recognize revenue upon shipment until such time as we can reasonably estimate and record provisions for Sales Deductions and returns utilizing historical information and market research projections.\n \u2022 Projections - Future revenues are estimated after considering many factors such as initial market opportunity, pricing, sales trajectories to peak sales levels, competitive environment and product evolution. Future costs and expenses are estimated after considering historical market trends, market participant synergies and the timing and level of additional development costs to obtain the initial or additional regulatory approvals, maintain or further enhance the product. We generally assume initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals which typically may not occur for a number of years. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than those assumed since projections are subjected to multiple factors including trial results and regulatory matters which could materially change the ultimate commercial success of the asset as well as significantly alter the costs to develop the respective asset into commercially viable products. \nWe assess the collectability of accounts receivable balances by considering factors such as historical collection experience, customer credit worthiness, the age of accounts receivable balances, regulatory changes and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our reported net income (loss) is directly affected by our estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $36.3 million and $25.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u2022 Estimated useful life - The asset life expected to contribute meaningful cash flows is determined after considering all pertinent matters associated with the asset, including expected regulatory approval dates (if unapproved), exclusivity periods and other legal, regulatory or contractual provisions as well as the effects of any obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors, including barriers to entry. \nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $196.6 million and $57.9 million, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in 2015, which recognized $118.1 million and $1.8 million of selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015, respectively, increased personnel expenses as we expand our sales, marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure, and an increase in professional fees attributable to our acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, included bad debt expense of $24.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and equity-based compensation expense of $17.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively. The increase in bad debt expense was due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference. The increase in equity-based compensation expense was due to additional options grants made in 2015 and fluctuations in the price of our common stock.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).\u201d ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 was effective for the Company beginning after January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2014-12 in the first quarter of 2016 using the prospective application did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-refundable license fees for the out-license of our technology are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement. We recognize non-refundable upfront license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and qualifies for treatment as a separate unit of accounting under multiple-element arrangement guidance. License fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations that do not have standalone value are recorded as deferred revenue, included in Accrued expenses or Other long-term liabilities, when received and generally are recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligations only after both the license period has commenced and we have delivered the technology.\nThe increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to a $16.7 million increase in research and development expenses related to hGH-CTP, a long acting human growth hormone which was outlicensed to Pfizer in 2015, including manufacturing expense for biological products, and the recognition of $2.3 million of expense for our NDA submission to the FDA for oral Rayaldee in May 2015. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 also included $4.1 million from the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively. This was partially offset by decreased expenses incurred by OPKO Renal related to phase 3 clinical trials for Rayaldee, which were completed in 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded, as an offset to research and development expenses, $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to research and development grants received from our collaboration and funding agreements. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included equity-based compensation expense of $7.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively.", "item_7_text": "The assessment of our obligations and related performance periods requires significant management judgment. If an agreement contains research and development obligations, the relevant time period for the research and development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process. Such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized, and as a result, management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of research and development on a periodic basis.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, include equity-based compensation expense of $33.4 million and $17.4 million, respectively. The increase in equity-based compensation expense is due to additional options grants made in 2016 and $8.9 million of expense related to the acceleration of stock option vesting for certain Bio-Reference executives.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842),\u201d which will require organizations that lease assets with lease terms of more than 12 months to recognize assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases on their balance sheets. The ASU will also require new qualitative and quantitative disclosures to help investors and other financial statement users better understand the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. ASU 2016-02 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n- Product license agreements effective during the lesser of 15 years or patent expiration whereby payments and amounts are determined by applying a royalty rate on uncapped future sales.\nLoss from investments in investees. We have made investments in other early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for us as a shareholder or member. We accounted for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate share of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees' technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipated they would continue to report a net loss. Loss from investments in investees was $7.1 million and $3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In the third quarter of 2015, we deconsolidated STI, and account for our retained interest in STI as an equity method investment.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $490.9 million and $196.6 million, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015, which accounted for $382.4 million of selling, general and administrative expenses in the 2016 period compared to $118.1 million for the comparable period of 2015. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2016 included costs related to the launch of Rayaldee. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 are $17.9 million of severance costs for certain Bio-Reference executives.\n \u2022 Tax rates - The expected future income is tax effected using a market participant tax rate. In determining the tax rate, we consider the jurisdiction in which the intellectual property is held and location of research and manufacturing infrastructure. We also consider that any repatriation of earnings would likely have U.S. tax consequences. \nConsidering the high risk nature of research and development and the industry's success rate of bringing developmental compounds to market, IPR&D impairment charges are likely to occur in future periods. IPR&D is closely monitored and assessed each period for impairment.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10),\u201d which addresses certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. The ASU requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. ASU 2016-01 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIncome taxes. Income taxes are accounted for under the asset-and-liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nWe launched Rayaldee in the U.S. through our dedicated renal sales force in November 2016. Rayaldee is distributed in the U.S. principally through the retail pharmacy channel, which initiates with the largest wholesalers in the U.S. (collectively, \"Rayaldee Customers\"). In addition to distribution agreements with Rayaldee Customers, we have entered into arrangements with many health care providers and payers that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks and discounts with respect to the purchase of Rayaldee.\n- Contractual obligations in connection with clinical trials, which span over two years, and that depend on patient enrollment. The total amount of expenditures is dependent on the actual number of patients enrolled and as such, the contracts do not specify the maximum amount we may owe.\nLoss from investments in investees. We have made investments in other early stage companies that we perceive to have valuable proprietary technology and significant potential to create value for us as a shareholder or member. We account for these investments under the equity method of accounting, resulting in the recording of our proportionate share of their losses until our share of their loss exceeds our investment. Until the investees' technologies are commercialized, if ever, we anticipate they will continue to report a net loss. Loss from investments in investees was $7.7 million and $7.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nGrant repayment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a payment of $25.9 million to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy ( OCS\u201d) in connection with repayment obligations resulting from grants previously made by the OCS to OPKO Biologics to support development of hGH-CTP and the outlicense of the technology outside of Israel.\n\nIn May 2015, we entered into a series of purchase agreements to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of EirGen, a specialty pharmaceutical company incorporated in Ireland focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products, for $133.8 million. We acquired the outstanding shares of EirGen for approximately $100.2 million in cash and delivered 2,420,487 shares of our Common Stock valued at approximately $33.6 million based on the closing price per share of our Common Stock as reported by the New York Stock Exchange on the closing date of the acquisition, $13.88 per share.\nOther income and (expense), net. Other income and (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $3.9 million and $7.7 million of income, respectively. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily consists of a $2.5 million gain recognized in connection with the merger of STI and VBI Vaccines Inc., a $5.0 million gain recognized in connection with the settlement of a legal matter and foreign currency transaction gains recognized during the period, which was partially offset by a $4.8 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investments in Xenetic, ARNO and RXi down to their respective fair values. Other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily consists of a $15.9 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of STI in 2015 which was partially offset by a $7.3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investment in RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation down to its fair value.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes,\u201d which requires deferred tax liabilities and assets to be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. We early adopted the provisions of this ASU prospectively in the fourth quarter of 2015, and did not retrospectively adjust the prior periods. The adoption of this ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes and reduces complexity without decreasing the usefulness of information provided to users of financial statements. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not recognize any product revenues related to Rayaldee sales. Payments received from Rayaldee Customers in advance of recognition of revenue are recorded as deferred revenue included in Accrued expenses in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. The related deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2016 was $1.6 million. The corresponding costs of product revenues for which we have not recognized product revenue have similarly not yet been reflected in our Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n \u2022 Discount rate - Discount rates are selected after considering the risks inherent in the future cash flows; the assessment of the asset's life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset, including consideration of any technical, legal, regulatory, or economic barriers to entry, as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset.  Goodwill was $704.6 million and $743.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, by assessing qualitative factors or performing a quantitative analysis in determining whether it is more likely than not that its fair value exceeds the carrying value. Examples of qualitative factors include our share price, our\nRevenue from transfer of intellectual property includes revenue related to the sale, license or transfer of intellectual property such as upfront license payments, license fees, milestone and royalty payments received through our license, and collaboration and commercialization agreements. We analyze our multiple-element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting.\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $400.6 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $321.9 million of the year-over-year revenue growth. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\n- Contingent consideration that includes payments upon achievement of certain milestones including meeting development milestones such as the completion of successful clinical trials, NDA approvals by the FDA and revenue milestones upon the achievement of certain revenue targets all of which are anticipated to be paid within the next seven years and are payable in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option, and that may aggregate up to $159.4 million.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ( PSLRA\u201d), Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the Securities Act\u201d), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the Exchange Act\u201d), about our expectations, beliefs, or intentions regarding our product development efforts, business, financial condition, results of operations, strategies, or prospects. You can identify forward-looking statements by the fact that these statements do not relate strictly to historical or current matters. Rather, forward-looking statements relate to anticipated or expected events, activities, trends, or results as of the date they are made. Because forward-looking statements relate to matters that have not yet occurred, these statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Many factors could cause our actual activities or results to differ materially from the activities and results anticipated in forward-looking statements. These factors include those contained in Item 1A - Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. We intend that all forward-looking statements be subject to the safe harbor provisions of PSLRA. These forward-looking statements are only predictions and reflect our views as of the date they are made with respect to future events and financial performance.\nRevenues. Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $729.9 million compared to the prior year. Revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nRevenue recognition. Revenue for laboratory services is recognized at the time test results are reported, which approximates when services are provided. Services are provided to patients covered by various third-party payer programs including various managed care organizations, as well as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Billings for services under third-party payer programs are included in revenue net of allowances for contractual discounts and allowances for differences between the amounts billed and estimated program payment amounts. Adjustments to the estimated payment amounts based on final settlement with the programs are recorded upon settlement as an adjustment to revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 16% and 9%, respectively, of our revenues from services were derived directly from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The increase in revenues from laboratory services, including revenue from Medicare and Medicaid programs, is due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015.\nContingent consideration. Each period we revalue the contingent consideration obligations associated with certain prior acquisitions to their fair value and record increases in the fair value as contingent consideration expense and decreases in the fair value as a reduction in contingent consideration expense. Changes in contingent consideration result from changes in the assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of related milestones, the estimated timing in which the milestones are achieved and the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of the liability. Contingent consideration may change significantly as our development programs progress, revenue estimates evolve and additional data is obtained, impacting our assumptions. The assumptions used in estimating fair value require significant judgment. The use of different assumptions and judgments could result in a materially different estimate of fair value which may have a material impact on our results from operations and financial position.\nindications and lead the manufacturing activities covered by the global development plan. In December 2016, we announced preliminary topline data from our Phase 3, double blind, placebo controlled study of hGH-CTP in adults with GHD. Although there was no statistically significant difference between hGH-CTP and placebo on the primary endpoint of change in trunk fat mass from baseline to 26 weeks, after unblinding the study, we identified an exceptional value of trunk fat mass reduction in the placebo group that may have affected the primary outcome. We believe the exceptional data point warrants an outlier sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint and related secondary endpoints. Upon completion of the data sensitivity analysis, we plan to discuss the study results and outlier analysis with the regulatory authorities to determine next steps in obtaining regulatory approval.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we also satisfied a $25.0 million contingent payment to the former owners of OPKO Renal through the issuance of 2,611,648 shares of our common stock in 2016.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nIn January 2015, we partnered with Pfizer through a worldwide agreement for the development and commercialization of our long-acting hGH-CTP for the treatment of GHD in adults and children, as well as for the treatment of growth failure in children born SGA. Under the terms of the agreements with Pfizer, we received non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payments of $295.0 million in the first quarter of 2015 and are eligible to receive up to an additional $275 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory milestones. Pfizer received the exclusive license to commercialize hGH-CTP worldwide. In addition, we are eligible to receive initial tiered royalty payments associated with the commercialization of hGH-CTP for Adult GHD with percentage rates ranging from the high teens to mid-twenties. Upon the launch of hGH-CTP for Pediatric GHD in certain major markets, the royalties will transition to regional, tiered gross profit sharing for both hGH-CTP and Pfizer's Genotropin\u00ae.\nIn July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory,\u201d which changes the measurement principle for entities that do not measure inventory using the last-in, first-out ( LIFO\u201d) or retail inventory method from the lower of cost or market to lower of cost and net realizable value. ASU 2015-11 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $5.1 million and $24.4 million, respectively. The decrease in contingent consideration expense was attributable to OPKO Renal resulting from an increase in the fair value of our contingent obligations to OPKO Renal in 2014 due to changes in assumptions regarding probabilities of successful achievement of future milestones driven by the two successful phase 3 trials of Rayaldee in 2014. The contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2015 related to potential amounts payable to former stockholders of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal pursuant to our acquisition agreements in January 2011, October 2011, August 2012 and March 2013, respectively.\nOVERVIEW\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal, we agreed to pay future consideration to the sellers upon the achievement of certain events, including up to an additional $19.1 million in shares of our Common Stock to the former stockholders of OPKO Diagnostics upon and subject to the achievement of certain milestones; and up to an additional $125.0 million in either shares of our Common Stock or cash, at our option subject to the achievement of certain milestones, to the former shareholders of OPKO Renal.\nThe increase in Revenue from services is attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in Revenue from products principally reflects an increase in revenue from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, and an increase in revenue from OPKO Chile. Revenue from transfer of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2016 principally reflects $50.0 million of revenue from the initial payment in the VFMCRP Agreement and $70.6 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction. Revenue from transfer of intellectual property for the year ended December 31, 2015 principally reflects $65.5 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction and $15.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee, TESARO, in the fourth quarter of 2015. We are recognizing the non-refundable $295.0 million upfront payments received in the Pfizer Transaction on a straight-line basis over the expected performance period. The performance period is expected to continue through 2019, when we anticipate completing the various research and development services that are specified in the Pfizer Transaction.\nIn May 2016, EirGen, our wholly-owned subsidiary, partnered with VFMCRP through a Development and License Agreement for the development and marketing of Rayaldee in Europe, Canada, Mexico, Australia, South Korea and certain other international markets. The license to VFMCRP potentially covers all therapeutic and prophylactic uses of the product in human patients, provided that initially the license is for the use of the product for the treatment or prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism related to patients with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency (\"Initial Indication\"). We received a non-refundable and non-creditable upfront payment of $50 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $232 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales-based milestones. In addition, we are eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalty payments or a minimum royalty, whichever is greater, upon commencement of sales of the product.\nOur licensee, TESARO, received approval by the U.S. FDA in September 2015 for oral VARUBITM, a neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. In November 2015, TESARO announced the commercial launch of VARUBITM in the United States. We are eligible to receive milestone payments of up to $30.0 million (of which $20.0 million has been received to date) upon achievement of certain regulatory and commercial sale milestones and additional commercial milestone payments of up to $85.0 million if specified levels of annual net sales are achieved. TESARO is also obligated to pay us tiered royalties on annual net sales achieved in the United States and Europe at percentage rates that range from the low double digits to the low twenties, and outside of the United States and Europe at low double-digit percentage rates.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the total availability under our Credit Agreement with CB and our lines of credit with financial institutions in Chile and Spain was $151.9 million, of which $47.3 million was used and outstanding at December 31, 2016. The weighted average interest rate on these lines of credit is approximately 4.7%. These lines of credit are short-term and are used primarily as a source of working capital. The highest balance at any time during the year ended December 31, 2016, was $83.5 million. We intend to continue to enter into these lines of credit as needed. There is no assurance that these lines of credit or other funding sources will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, in the future.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $111.2 million and $99.5 million, respectively. Research and development costs include external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses include clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We track external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and PMA's (pre-market approval) for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses are incurred to support overall research and development activities and include expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our income tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $56.1 million, and $113.7 million, respectively. The change in income taxes is primarily due to a $93.4 million release of OPKO's valuation allowance in 2015 on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the merger with Bio-Reference and to changes in the geographic mix of revenues and expenses. In addition, income taxes in 2016 benefited from a favorable corporate tax rate reduction in Israel.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was $7.4 million and $8.4 million, respectively. Interest expense is principally related to interest incurred on the 2033 Senior Notes including amortization of related deferred financing costs and to the interest incurred on Bio-Reference's outstanding debt under its credit facility. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 is due to a decrease in the average principal amount of the 2033 Senior Notes outstanding in 2016 compared to 2015. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 also reflects\nThe following table provides information as of December 31, 2016, with respect to the amounts and timing of our known contractual obligation payments due by period.\n \u2022 Probability of Technical and Regulatory Success ( PTRS\u201d) Rate - PTRS rates are determined based upon industry averages considering the respective program's development stage and disease indication and adjusted for specific information or data known at the acquisition date. Subsequent clinical results or other internal or external data obtained could alter the PTRS rate and materially impact the estimated fair value of the intangible asset in subsequent periods leading to impairment charges. \nThe increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, is due to an increase in research and development expenses related to hGH-CTP, a long acting human growth hormone which was outlicensed to Pfizer in 2015, and to an increase in research and development expenses for Factor VIIa-CTP. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 also include $8.8 million from the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively, compared to $4.1 million for the comparable period of 2015. This was partially offset by decreased expenses incurred by OPKO Renal related to the development of Rayaldee. In addition, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded, as an offset to research and development expenses, $2.7 million and $2.3 million, respectively, related to research and development grants received from our collaboration and funding agreements. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include equity-based compensation expenses of $7.5 million and $7.9 million, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to expand our research and development of potential future products.\nIncome tax benefit (provision). Our income tax benefit was due to a $93.4 million release of OPKO's valuation allowance on our U.S. deferred tax assets as a result of the merger with Bio-Reference. This was partially offset by expense recognized on taxable income from the Pfizer Transaction during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition, our income tax benefit (provision) reflected the projected income tax payable in the U.S., Ireland, Israel, Chile, Spain, Mexico, and Luxembourg.\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expenses, including expenses related to the hiring of personnel and additional clinical trials. We expect that selling, general and administrative expenses will also increase as we expand our sales, marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure.\nfinancial performance compared to budgets, long-term financial plans, macroeconomic, industry and market conditions as well as the substantial excess of fair value over the carrying value of net assets from the annual impairment test previously performed. No goodwill impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of our testing. We recorded $87 thousand of goodwill impairment during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of our testing.\nRevenue from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met: the milestone payments are non-refundable; there was substantive uncertainty at the date of entering into the arrangement that the milestone would be achieved; the milestone payment is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item by us; the milestone relates solely to past performance; and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone. If any of these conditions are not met, the milestone payments are not considered to be substantive and are, therefore, deferred and recognized as Revenue from transfer of intellectual property over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations.\nIn August 2016, we completed the acquisition of Transition Therapeutics, a clinical stage biotechnology company. Holders of Transition Therapeutics common stock received 6,431,899 shares of OPKO Common Stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $58.5 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $9.10 as reported by NASDAQ on the closing date.\nThe portion of our accounts receivable due from individual patients comprises the largest portion of credit risk. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, receivables due from patients represent approximately 7.3% and 7.5%, respectively, of our consolidated accounts receivable (prior to allowance for doubtful accounts).\nGrant repayment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we made a payment of $25.9 million to the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Israeli Ministry of Economy ( OCS\u201d) in connection with repayment obligations resulting from grants previously made by the OCS to OPKO Biologics to support development of hGH-CTP and the outlicense of the technology outside of Israel. We did not have any such activity for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThe increase in Revenue from services was attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in Revenue from products principally reflected $12.1 million of revenue from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $8.7 million, and decreased revenue from STI, a VIE we deconsolidated in July 2015. The increase in Revenue from transfer of intellectual property principally reflected $65.5 million of revenue from the transfer of intellectual property related to the Pfizer Transaction and $15.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee TESARO in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to $5.0 million of revenue from a milestone payment from our licensee TESARO in 2014.\nFor The Years Ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014\nIntangible assets, net were $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion, including IPR&D of $644.7 million and $792.3 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Intangible assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable, although IPR&D is required to be tested at least annually until the project is completed or abandoned. Upon obtaining regulatory approval, the IPR&D asset is then accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life. If the project is abandoned, the IPR&D asset is charged to expense.\na non-cash write-off of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million as interest expense related to the exchange of $55.4 million principal of 2033 Senior Notes in 2015. This was partially offset by interest incurred on Bio-Reference's outstanding debt under its credit facility for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $28.0 million and $10.9 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Amortization expense reflected the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $14.6 million and $1.7 million from Bio-Reference and EirGen which we acquired in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively. Our IPR&D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, the IPR&D assets will then be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $99.5 million and $83.6 million, respectively. Research and development costs included external and internal expenses, partially offset by third-party grants and funding arising from collaboration agreements. External expenses included clinical and non-clinical activities performed by contract research organizations, lab services, purchases of drug and diagnostic product materials and manufacturing development costs. We tracked external research and development expenses by individual program for phase 3 clinical trials for drug approval and PMA's (pre-market approval) for diagnostics tests, if any. Internal expenses include employee-related expenses including salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense. Other internal research and development expenses were incurred to support overall research and development activities and included expenses related to general overhead and facilities.\nIn August 2015, we completed the acquisition of Bio-Reference, the third largest full service clinical laboratory in the United States, known for its innovative technological solutions and pioneering leadership in the areas of genomics and genetic sequencing. Holders of Bio-Reference common stock received 76,566,147 shares of OPKO Common Stock for the outstanding shares of Bio-Reference common stock. The transaction was valued at approximately $950.1 million, based on a closing price per share of our Common Stock of $12.38 as reported by the New York Stock Exchange, or $34.05 per share of Bio-Reference common stock. Included in the transaction value is $2.3 million related to the value of replacement stock option awards attributable to pre-merger service.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was $8.4 million and $12.3 million, respectively. Interest expense was principally related to interest incurred on the 2033 Senior Notes and the amortization of related deferred financing costs. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was due to a decrease in the principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes outstanding from $87.6 million at December 31, 2014 to $32.2 million as of December 31, 2015. This was partially offset by interest expense of $1.9 million from Bio-Reference due to outstanding debt under their credit facility. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also reflected non-cash write-offs of deferred financing costs of $1.0 million and $1.5 million as interest expense related to exchange or conversion of $55.4 million and $70.4 million principal of 2033 Senior Notes during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn-Process Research and Development. In May 2014, we acquired Inspiro in a stock for stock transaction. We recorded the transaction as an asset acquisition and recorded the assets and liabilities at fair value, and as a result, we recorded $10.1 million of acquired in-process research and development expense. In addition, pursuant to our agreement with Merck & Co. ( Merck\u201d), we were required to make a $2.0 million payment upon the achievement of a milestone for VARUBITM which was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2014. The agreement was accounted for as an asset acquisition and the entire $2.0 million milestone payment was allocated to in-process research and development expense. No In-process research and development expense was incurred during the year ended December 31, 2015.\n\nWe will lead the clinical activities and will be responsible for funding the development programs for the key indications, which includes Adult and Pediatric GHD and Pediatric SGA. Pfizer will be responsible for all development costs for additional indications as well as all post-marketing studies. In addition, Pfizer will fund the commercialization activities for all\nrecognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and the respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date. We periodically evaluate the realizability of our net deferred tax assets. Our tax accruals are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant such adjustment.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nRecent accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d ASU 2014-09 clarifies the principles for recognizing revenue and develops a common revenue standard for GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards that removes inconsistencies and weaknesses in revenue requirements, provides a more robust framework for addressing revenue issues, improves comparability of revenue recognition practices across entities, industries, jurisdictions, and capital markets, provides more useful information to users of financial statements through improved disclosure requirements and simplifies the preparation of financial statements by reducing the number of requirements to which an entity must refer. ASU 2014-09 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. Companies can choose to apply the ASU using either the full retrospective approach or a modified retrospective approach. We are currently evaluating both methods of adoption and the impact that the adoption of this ASU will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFor The Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAccounting estimates. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates.\nThe increase in cost of service revenue was attributable to the acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015. The increase in cost of product revenue principally reflected cost of revenue of $6.8 million from EirGen, which we acquired in May 2015, which was partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates of approximately $5.2 million and the deconsolidation of STI in July 2015.\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses: \nWe operate established pharmaceutical platforms in Spain, Ireland, Chile and Mexico, which are generating revenue and from which we expect to generate positive cash flow and facilitate future market entry for our products currently in development. EirGen, our specialty pharmaceutical manufacturing and development site in Ireland, is focused on the development and commercial supply of high potency, high barrier to entry pharmaceutical products. In addition, we operate a specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients ( APIs\u201d) manufacturer in Israel, which we expect will facilitate the development of our pipeline of molecules and compounds for our proprietary products.\nIn August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230),\u201d which addresses the classification of eight specific cash flow issues with the objective of reducing the existing diversity in practice. ASU 2016-15 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAs part of the arrangement, the companies will share responsibility for the conduct of trials specified within an agreed-upon development plan, with each company leading certain activities within the plan. For the initial development plan, the companies have agreed to certain cost sharing arrangements. VFMCRP will be responsible for all other development costs that VFMCRP considers necessary to develop the product for the Initial Indication in the Territory except as otherwise provided in the VFMCRP Agreement. EirGen also granted to VFMCRP an option to acquire an exclusive license to use, import, offer for sale, sell, distribute and commercialize the product in the United States for treatment of SHPT in dialysis patients with stage 5 CKD and vitamin D insufficiency (the \"Dialysis Indication\") Upon exercise of the Option, VFMCRP will reimburse EirGen for all of the development costs incurred by EirGen with respect to the product for the Dialysis Indication in the United States. VFMCRP would also pay EirGen up to an additional aggregate amount of $555 million upon the achievement of certain milestones and would be obligated to pay double digit royalties on VFMCRP's sales in the United States for the Dialysis Indication.\nConcentration of credit risk and allowance for doubtful accounts. Financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of accounts receivable. Substantially all of our accounts receivable are with either companies in the health care industry or patients. However, credit risk is limited due to the number of our clients as well as their dispersion across many different geographic regions.\nWe believe that the cash and cash equivalents on hand at December 31, 2016, and the amounts available to be borrowed under our lines of credit are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for operations and debt service beyond the next 12 months. We based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong or are subject to change, and we may be required to use our available cash resources sooner than we currently expect. If we acquire additional assets or companies, accelerate our product development programs or initiate additional clinical trials, we will need additional funds. Our future cash requirements will depend on a number of factors, including our relationship with Pfizer, success of the commercial launch of Rayaldee, Bio-Reference's financial performance, possible acquisitions, the continued progress of research and development of our product candidates, the timing and outcome of clinical trials and regulatory approvals, the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending, and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights, the status of competitive products, the availability of financing, and our success in developing markets for our product candidates. If we are not able to secure additional funding when needed, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or possible acquisitions.\nThe preceding table does not include information where the amounts of the obligations are not currently determinable, including the following:\nIn November 2016, we launched commercial sales for Rayaldee in the U.S. market. The FDA approved Rayaldee extended release capsules in June 2016 for the treatment of SHPT in adults with stage 3 or 4 CKD and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. We have a highly specialized sales and marketing team dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee, and we expect to increase the sales and marketing team in the second half of 2017 as market access improves and prescription trends increase.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments,\u201d which replaces the requirement that an acquirer in a business combination account for measurement period adjustments retrospectively with a requirement that an acquirer recognize adjustments to the provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. ASU 2015-16 requires that the acquirer record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization, or other income effects, if any, as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. Our early adoption of ASU 2015-16 in 2015 did not have a significant impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (net realizable value). Cost is determined by the first-in, first-out method. We consider such factors as the amount of inventory on hand, estimated time required to sell such inventories, remaining shelf-life, and current market conditions to determine whether inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Inventories at our diagnostics segment consist primarily of purchased laboratory supplies, which is used in our testing laboratories.\nWe amortize intangible assets with definite lives on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 3 to 20 years. We use the straight-line method of amortization as there is no reliably determinable pattern in which the economic benefits of our intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. Amortization expense was $64.4 million and $28.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nContingent consideration. Contingent consideration expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $17.0 million and $5.1 million, respectively. The increase in contingent consideration is attributable to OPKO Renal resulting from an increase in the fair value of our contingent obligations due to changes in assumptions regarding the timing of successful achievement of future milestones driven by the FDA approval of Rayaldee in June 2016. The contingent consideration liabilities at December 31, 2016 relate to potential amounts payable to former stockholders of CURNA, OPKO Diagnostics, OPKO Health Europe and OPKO Renal pursuant to our acquisition agreements in January 2011, October 2011, August 2012 and March 2013, respectively.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $64.4 million and $28.0 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Amortization expense reflects the amortization of acquired intangible assets with defined useful lives. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 also includes $8.0 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets for Rayaldee. Upon the FDA's approval of Rayaldee in June 2016, we reclassified $187.6 million of IPR&D related to Rayaldee from In-process research and development to Intangible assets, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheet and began to amortize that asset. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016 includes $43.2 million and $2.5 million from Bio-Reference and EirGen which we acquired in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively, compared to $14.6 million and $1.7 million, respectively, for the comparable period of 2015. Our IPR&D assets will not be amortized until the underlying development programs are completed. Upon obtaining regulatory approval by the U.S. FDA, the IPR&D assets will be accounted for as a finite-lived intangible asset and amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life.\nThe estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in projections and assumptions; therefore, in some instances changes in these assumptions could potentially lead to impairment. We perform sensitivity analyses around our assumptions in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the results of our testing. Ultimately, future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value. We believe that our estimates are consistent with assumptions that marketplace participants would use in their estimates of fair value. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions, we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d to provide guidance on management's responsibility in evaluating whether there is substantial doubt about a company's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 with early adoption permitted. Our adoption of ASU 2014-15 in the fourth quarter of 2016 did not have an impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIntangible assets are highly vulnerable to impairment charges, particularly newly acquired assets for recently launched products and IPR&D. These assets are initially measured at fair value and therefore any reduction in expectations used in the valuations could potentially lead to impairment. Some of the more common potential risks leading to impairment include competition, earlier than expected loss of exclusivity, pricing pressures, adverse regulatory changes or clinical trial results, delay or failure to obtain regulatory approval and additional development costs, inability to achieve expected synergies, higher operating costs, changes in tax laws and other macro-economic changes. The complexity in estimating the fair value of intangible assets in connection with an impairment test is similar to the initial valuation.\nPre-launch inventories. We may accumulate commercial quantities of certain product candidates prior to the date we anticipate that such products will receive final U.S. FDA approval. The accumulation of such pre-launch inventories involves the risk that such products may not be approved for marketing by the FDA on a timely basis, or ever. This risk notwithstanding, we may accumulate pre-launch inventories of certain products when such action is appropriate in relation to the commercial value of the product launch opportunity. In accordance with our policy, this pre-launch inventory is expensed.\nWe recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, collectability is reasonably assured, and the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, which is generally when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers. Our estimates for sales returns and allowances are based upon the historical patterns of product returns and allowances taken, matched against the sales from which they originated, and our evaluation of specific factors that may increase or decrease the risk of product returns. Product revenues are recorded net of estimated rebates, chargebacks, discounts, co-pay assistance and other deductions (collectively, \"Sales Deductions\") as well as estimated product returns. Allowances are recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time product revenues are recognized.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis,\u201d which amends current consolidation guidance including changes to both the variable and voting interest models used by companies to evaluate whether an entity should be consolidated. The requirements from ASU 2015-02 were effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2015-02 in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther income and (expense), net. Other income and (expense), net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $7.7 million of income and $3.1 million of expense, respectively. The increase in other income and (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily due to a $15.9 million gain recognized on the deconsolidation of STI in the third quarter of 2015. This was partially offset by a $7.3 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to write our investment in RXi Pharmaceuticals Corporation down to its fair value of $0.9 million as of December 31, 2015 compared to a $1.4 million other-than-temporary impairment charge to our investment in ARNO Therapeutics in 2014.\nWe plan to construct a research, development and manufacturing center in Waterford, Ireland, for which we expect to incur between $30 million and $40 million for the construction and validation of the facility with expenditures beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expected completion in 2019. Currently, we plan to fund the project from cash on hand or from third party funding sources that may be available to us.\nEquity-based compensation. We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award. That cost is recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. We record excess tax benefits, realized from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash inflow and as a reduction of taxes paid in cash flow from operations. Equity-based compensation arrangements to non-employees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date. The measurement of equity-based compensation to non-employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest. We estimate the grant-date fair value of our stock option grants using a valuation model known as the Black-Scholes-Merton formula or the Black-Scholes Model.\u201d The Black-Scholes Model requires the use of several variables to estimate the grant-date fair value of stock options including expected term, expected volatility, expected dividends and risk-free interest rate. We perform analyses to calculate and select the appropriate variable assumptions used in the Black-Scholes Model and to estimate forfeitures of equity-based awards. We are required to adjust our forfeiture estimates on at least an annual basis based on the number of share-based awards that ultimately vest. The selection of assumptions and estimated forfeiture rates is subject to significant judgment and future changes to our assumptions and estimates which may have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCosts of revenue. Costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $376.2 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $375.9 million of the increase in cost of service revenue. The increase in cost of product revenue is attributable to an increase in cost of revenue from EirGen and OPKO Chile, which was partially offset by the deconsolidation of SciVac Therapeutics Inc. ( STI\u201d) in July 2015. Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:\nIn November 2016, we launched commercial sales for Rayaldee in the U.S. market. The FDA approved Rayaldee extended release capsules in June 2016 for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease (CKD) and serum total 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels less than 30 ng/mL. We have a highly specialized sales and marketing team dedicated to the launch and commercialization of Rayaldee, and we expect to increase the sales and marketing team in the second half of 2017.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, were $2.8 million of income and $39.1 million of expense, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net related to non-cash income (expense) reflects the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in the 2033 Senior Notes of $7.0 million and $(36.6) million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the year ended December 31, 2016 also reflects $4.2 million of expense related to the change in the fair value of warrants and options to purchase additional shares of Neovasc, Cocrystal Pharma, Inc., ARNO Therapeutics, Inc. and MabVax Therapeutics Holdings, Inc.\nOn January 3, 2017, we announced that our 2033 Senior Notes continue to be convertible by holders of such 2033 Senior Notes through March 31, 2017. We have elected to satisfy the conversion obligation in shares of our Common Stock. This conversion right has been extended because the closing price per share of our Common Stock has exceeded $9.19, or 130% of the applicable conversion price of $7.07, for at least 20 of 30 consecutive trading days during the quarter ended on December 31, 2016. The 2033 Senior Notes will continue to be convertible until March 31, 2017, and may be convertible thereafter, if one or more of the conversion conditions specified in the Indenture is satisfied during future measurement periods. Pursuant to the Indenture, a holder who elects to convert the 2033 Senior Notes will receive 141.4827 shares of our Common Stock plus such number of additional shares as is applicable on the conversion date per $1,000 principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes based on the early conversion provisions in the Indenture.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $168.7 million. Cash provided by operations during 2016 principally reflects a $50.0 million upfront payment received from the VFMCRP Agreement, our operations at Bio-Reference, and a $39.4 million payment received from the Internal Revenue Service for a change in accounting method, partially offset by expenses related to general and administrative activities related to our corporate operations, research and development activities and our launch activities related to Rayaldee. Cash used in investing activities primarily reflects capital expenditures of $18.5 million, investments of $14.4 million and acquisitions of intangible assets of $5.0 million, partially offset by cash acquired in the acquisition of Transition Therapeutics of $15.9 million. Cash used in financing activities primarily reflects net repayments on lines of credit of $43.8 million, partially offset by $8.6 million received from Common Stock option and Common Stock warrant exercises. We have not generated sustained positive cash flow sufficient to offset our operating and other expenses and our primary source of cash has been from the public and private placement of stock, the issuance of the 2033 Senior Notes and credit facilities available to us.\nFair value changes of derivative instruments, net. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, were $39.1 million and $10.6 million of expense, respectively. Fair value changes of derivative instruments, net principally related to non-cash expense related to the changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in the 2033 Senior Notes of $36.6 million and $12.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350),\u201d which simplifies how an entity is required to test for goodwill impairment. ASU 2017-04 will be effective for annual or interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted after January 1, 2017. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nGoodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets, including IPR&D, acquired in business combinations, licensing and other transactions at December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, representing approximately 76% and 78% of total assets, respectively.\nCosts of revenue. Costs of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $187.2 million compared to the prior year. Our acquisition of Bio-Reference in August 2015 accounted for $183.3 million of the year-over-year cost of revenue growth. Cost of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were as follows:\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718),\u201d which simplifies several aspects of the accounting for share-based payment award transactions, including the income tax consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, classification on the statement of cash flows and accounting for forfeitures. ASU 2016-09 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this new guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nInterest income. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, was not significant as our cash investment strategy emphasizes the security of the principal invested and fulfillment of liquidity needs.\nOn November 5, 2015, Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ( CB\u201d), as lender and administrative agent, as amended (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement provides for a $175.0 million secured revolving credit facility and includes a $20.0 million sub-facility for swingline loans and a $20.0 million sub-facility for the issuance of letters of credit. Bio-Reference may increase the credit facility to up to $275.0 million on a secured basis, subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions. The Credit Agreement matures on November 5, 2020 and is guaranteed by all of Bio-Reference's domestic subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement is also secured by substantially all assets of Bio-Reference and its domestic subsidiaries, as well as a non-recourse pledge by us of our equity interest in Bio-Reference. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on a borrowing base comprised of eligible accounts receivables of Bio-Reference and certain of its subsidiaries, as specified therein. The proceeds of the new credit facility were used to refinance existing indebtedness, to finance working capital needs and for general corporate purposes of Bio-Reference and its subsidiaries.\nInterest income. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, was not significant as our cash investment strategy emphasizes the security of the principal invested and fulfillment of liquidity needs.\nWe are a diversified healthcare company that seeks to establish industry-leading positions in large and rapidly growing medical markets. Our diagnostics business includes Bio-Reference Laboratories ( Bio-Reference\u201d), the nation's third-largest clinical laboratory with a core genetic testing business and a 400-person sales and marketing team to drive growth and leverage new products, including the 4Kscore prostate cancer test and the Claros 1 in-office immunoassay platform (in development). Our pharmaceutical business features Rayaldee, an FDA-approved treatment for secondary hyperparathyroidism ( SHPT\u201d) in adults with stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease ( CKD\u201d) and vitamin D insufficiency (launched in November 2016), and VARUBITM for chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (oral formulation launched by partner TESARO in November 2015 and pending approval for IV formulation), TT401, a once or twice weekly oxyntomodulin for type 2 diabetes and obesity which is a clinically advanced drug candidate among the new class of GLP-1 glucagon receptor dual agonists (Phase 2b), and TT701, an androgen receptor modulator for androgen deficiency indications. Our pharmaceutical business also features hGH-CTP, a once-weekly human growth hormone injection (in Phase 3 and partnered with Pfizer), a once-daily Factor VIIa drug for hemophilia (Phase 2a), and long-acting oxyntomodulin ( OXM\u201d) for diabetes and obesity (Phase 1).\nThe following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses: \n2033 Senior Notes. In January 2013, we issued $175.0 million of the 2033 Senior Notes. The 2033 Senior Notes were sold in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act. At December 31, 2016, $31.9 million principal amount of 2033 Senior Notes was outstanding.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nWhile we have receivables due from federal and state governmental agencies, we do not believe that such receivables represent a credit risk since the related health care programs are funded by federal and state governments, and payment is primarily dependent upon submitting appropriate documentation. Accounts receivable balances (net of contractual adjustments) from Medicare and Medicaid were $50.5 million and $26.1 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs,\u201d which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. ASU 2015-03 was effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2015-03 in the first quarter of 2016 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations, licensing and other transactions are generally recognized at the date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. We determined the fair value of intangible assets, including IPR&D, using the income method.\u201d This method starts with a forecast of net cash flows, risk adjusted for estimated probabilities of technical and regulatory success (for IPR&D) and adjusted to present value using an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk associated with the cash flow streams. All assets are valued from a market participant view which might be different than our specific views. The valuation process is very complex and requires significant input and judgment using internal and external sources. Although a valuation is required to be finalized within a one-year period, it must consider all and only those facts and evidence which existed at the acquisition date. The most complex and judgmental matters applicable to the valuation process are summarized below:\n \u2022 Unit of account - Most intangible assets are valued as single global assets rather than multiple assets for each jurisdiction or indication after considering the development stage, expected levels of incremental costs to obtain additional approvals, risks associated with further development, amount and timing of benefits expected to be derived in the future, expected patent lives in various jurisdictions and the intention to promote the asset as a global brand. \nWe lack the experiential data which would allow us to estimate Sales Deductions and returns. Therefore, as of December 31, 2016, we have determined that we do not yet meet the criteria for the recognition of revenue for shipments of Rayaldee at the time of shipment to Rayaldee Customers as allowances for Sales Deductions and returns are not known or cannot be reasonably estimated. We will not recognize revenue upon shipment until such time as we can reasonably estimate and record provisions for Sales Deductions and returns utilizing historical information and market research projections.\n \u2022 Projections - Future revenues are estimated after considering many factors such as initial market opportunity, pricing, sales trajectories to peak sales levels, competitive environment and product evolution. Future costs and expenses are estimated after considering historical market trends, market participant synergies and the timing and level of additional development costs to obtain the initial or additional regulatory approvals, maintain or further enhance the product. We generally assume initial positive cash flows to commence shortly after the receipt of expected regulatory approvals which typically may not occur for a number of years. Actual cash flows attributed to the project are likely to be different than those assumed since projections are subjected to multiple factors including trial results and regulatory matters which could materially change the ultimate commercial success of the asset as well as significantly alter the costs to develop the respective asset into commercially viable products. \nWe assess the collectability of accounts receivable balances by considering factors such as historical collection experience, customer credit worthiness, the age of accounts receivable balances, regulatory changes and current economic conditions and trends that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Our reported net income (loss) is directly affected by our estimate of the collectability of accounts receivable. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $36.3 million and $25.2 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n \u2022 Estimated useful life - The asset life expected to contribute meaningful cash flows is determined after considering all pertinent matters associated with the asset, including expected regulatory approval dates (if unapproved), exclusivity periods and other legal, regulatory or contractual provisions as well as the effects of any obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic factors, including barriers to entry. \nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $196.6 million and $57.9 million, respectively. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily due to the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in 2015, which recognized $118.1 million and $1.8 million of selling, general and administrative expenses in 2015, respectively, increased personnel expenses as we expand our sales, marketing and administrative staff and add infrastructure, and an increase in professional fees attributable to our acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen. Selling, general and administrative expenses during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, included bad debt expense of $24.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, and equity-based compensation expense of $17.4 million and $9.7 million, respectively. The increase in bad debt expense was due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference. The increase in equity-based compensation expense was due to additional options grants made in 2015 and fluctuations in the price of our common stock.\nIn June 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-12, Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be Achieved after the Requisite Service Period (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force).\u201d ASU 2014-12 requires that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. ASU 2014-12 was effective for the Company beginning after January 1, 2016. Our adoption of ASU 2014-12 in the first quarter of 2016 using the prospective application did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNon-refundable license fees for the out-license of our technology are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement. We recognize non-refundable upfront license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and qualifies for treatment as a separate unit of accounting under multiple-element arrangement guidance. License fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations that do not have standalone value are recorded as deferred revenue, included in Accrued expenses or Other long-term liabilities, when received and generally are recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligations only after both the license period has commenced and we have delivered the technology.\nThe increase in research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015, was primarily due to a $16.7 million increase in research and development expenses related to hGH-CTP, a long acting human growth hormone which was outlicensed to Pfizer in 2015, including manufacturing expense for biological products, and the recognition of $2.3 million of expense for our NDA submission to the FDA for oral Rayaldee in May 2015. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 also included $4.1 million from the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and EirGen in August 2015 and May 2015, respectively. This was partially offset by decreased expenses incurred by OPKO Renal related to phase 3 clinical trials for Rayaldee, which were completed in 2014. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded, as an offset to research and development expenses, $2.3 million and $2.4 million, respectively, related to research and development grants received from our collaboration and funding agreements. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 included equity-based compensation expense of $7.9 million and $5.0 million, respectively.", "item_7_tables": "Table

significantly in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Bio-Reference Laboratories in 2015 which contributed diagnostic testing revenue. Revenue also increased from sale of intellectual property rights and milestone payments.\n\n- Cost of revenue increased in 2016 compared to 2015, again largely due to the Bio-Reference acquisition. \n\n- Research and development expenses increased in 2016, driven by expenses for long-acting human growth hormone and Factor VIIa programs. This was partially offset by decreased expenses for Rayaldee after its FDA approval in 2016.\n\n- Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2016, primarily due to the Bio-Reference acquisition as well as costs related to the launch of Rayaldee.\n\n- Income tax benefit was higher in 2015 compared to 2016, mainly due to a tax valuation allowance release in 2015 after the Bio-Reference merger. \n\n- Intangible assets increased significantly in 2015 and 2016 due to acquisitions, including IPR&D assets which will be amortized once development is complete. Impairments of these assets are possible in the future.\n\n- The company has credit facilities and debt which provide liquidity, but it does not have sustained positive cash flow yet, so it relies on financing activities.\n\nIn summary, the acquisitions of Bio-Reference and other companies as well as new product development have driven revenue growth but also increased expenses and reliance on external financing. Monitoring the performance of recent acquisitions and success of product development efforts will be key going forward."}
