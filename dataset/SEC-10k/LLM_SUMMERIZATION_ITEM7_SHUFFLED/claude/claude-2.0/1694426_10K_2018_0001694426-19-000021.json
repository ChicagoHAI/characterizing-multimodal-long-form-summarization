Effective July 1, 2017, we acquired through the Delek/Alon the operations and net assets of Alon, as discussed in the 'Recent Strategic Developments' section of Item 1, Business, and as discussed in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Delek/Alon Merger continues to have a significant impact on our revenue and profitability as well as earnings per share, our net asset position, our purchasing position in the marketplace, our footprint in the refining industry, especially in the Gulf Coast Region/Permian Basin, and our ability to go to market and secure financing, and we continue to realize synergies from our combined operations.\nRefining Overview\nThe refining segment processes crude oil and other purchased feedstocks for the manufacture of transportation motor fuels, including various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, asphalt and other petroleum-based products that are distributed through owned and third-party product terminals. It had a combined nameplate capacity of 302,000 barrels per day as of December 31, 2018. Prior to the Delek/Alon Merger, the refining segment operated refineries in Tyler, Texas (the \"Tyler refinery\") and El Dorado, Arkansas (the \"El Dorado refinery\") with a combined design crude throughput (nameplate) capacity of 155,000 barrels per day (\"bpd\"), including the 75,000 bpd Tyler refinery and the 80,000 bpd El Dorado refinery. Effective with the Delek/Alon Merger, our refining segment now also includes a crude oil refinery located in Big Spring, Texas (the \"Big Spring refinery\") with a nameplate capacity of 73,000 bpd, a crude oil refinery located in Krotz Springs, Louisiana (the \"Krotz Springs refinery\") with a nameplate capacity of 74,000 bpd. Our refining segment also included two biodiesel facilities we own and operate that are engaged in the production of biodiesel fuels and related activities, located in Crossett, Arkansas and Cleburne, Texas.\nOur profitability in the refining segment is substantially determined by the difference between the cost of the crude oil feedstocks we purchase and the price of the refined products we sell, referred to as the \"crack spread\", \"refining margin\" or \"refined product margin\". The cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined petroleum products we ultimately sell from our refineries depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes, local, domestic and foreign political affairs, global conflict, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. Other significant factors that influence our results in the refining segment include operating costs (particularly the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity), seasonal factors, refinery utilization rates and planned or unplanned maintenance activities or turnarounds. Moreover, while the fluctuations in the cost of crude oil are typically reflected in the prices of light refined products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, the price of other residual products, such as asphalt, coke, carbon black oil and LPG are less likely to move in parallel with crude cost. This could cause additional pressure on our realized margin during periods of rising or falling crude oil prices. Additionally, our margins are impacted by the pricing differentials of the various types and sources of crude oil we use at our refineries and their relation to product pricing, such as the differentials between WTI Midland and WTI Cushing or WTI Midland and Brent crude oil.\nWith respect to measuring our refining margins at our refineries, we consider the following:\nTable 135: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For our Tyler refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread. The Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread is used as a benchmark for measuring a refinery's product margins by measuring the difference between the market price of light products and crude oil, and represents the approximate refined product margin resulting from processing one barrel of crude oil into three-fifths barrel of gasoline and two-fifths barrel of high-sulfur diesel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nTable 136: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For our Big Spring refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread. The Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread is calculated assuming that one barrel of WTI Cushing crude oil are converted into two-thirds barrel of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one-third barrel of Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel. Our Big Spring refinery is capable of processing substantial volumes of sour crude oil, which has historically cost less than intermediate, and/or substantial volumes of sweet crude oils, and therefore the WTI Cushing/WTS price differential, taking into account differences in production yield, is an important measure for helping us make strategic, market-respondent production decisions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>For our Krotz Springs refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 2-1-1 high sulfur diesel crack spread, which is calculated assuming that one barrel of LLS crude oil is converted into one-half barrel of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one-half barrel of Gulf Coast high sulfur diesel. The Krotz Springs refinery has the capability to process substantial volumes of light sweet, crude oils to produce a high percentage of refined light products.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>The crude oil and product slate flexibility of the El Dorado refinery allows us to take advantage of changes in the crude oil and product markets; therefore, we anticipate that the quantities and varieties of crude oil processed and products manufactured at the El Dorado refinery by processing a variety of feedstocks into a number of refined product types will continue to vary. While there is variability in the crude slate and the product output at the El Dorado refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread because we believe it to be the most closely aligned benchmark.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> A widening of the WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread will favorably influence the operating margin for our refineries. Alternatively, a narrowing of this differential will have an adverse effect on our operating margins. Global product prices are influenced by the price of Brent crude which is a global benchmark crude. Global product prices influence product prices in the U.S. As a result, our refineries are influenced by the spread between Brent crude and WTI Midland. The Brent less WTI Midland spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of WTI Cushing crude oil. A widening of the spread between Brent and WTI Cushing will favorably influence our refineries' operating margins. Also, the Krotz Springs refinery is influenced by the spread between Brent crude and LLS. The Brent less LLS spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of LLS crude oil. A discount in LLS relative to Brent will favorably influence the Krotz Springs refinery operating margin.\nThe cost to acquire the refined fuel products we sell to our wholesale customers in our logistics segment and at our convenience stores in our retail segment depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. Our retail merchandise sales are driven by convenience, customer service, competitive pricing and branding. Motor fuel margin is sales less the delivered cost of fuel and motor fuel taxes, measured on a cents per gallon basis. Our motor fuel margins are impacted by local supply, demand, weather, competitor pricing and product brand.\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our portfolio of businesses and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that, if consummated, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nLogistics Overview\nOur logistics segment gathers, transports and stores crude oil and markets, distributes, transports and stores refined products in select regions of the southeastern United States and west Texas for our refining segment and third parties. It is comprised of the consolidated balance sheet and results of operations of Delek Logistics Partners, LP (\"Delek Logistics\", NYSE:DKL), where we owned a 61.4% limited partner interest (at December 31, 2018) in Delek Logistics and a 94.6% interest in the entity that owns the entire 2.0% general partner interest in Delek Logistics and all of the incentive distribution rights. Delek Logistics was formed by Delek in 2012 to own, operate, acquire and construct crude oil and refined products logistics and marketing assets. A substantial majority of Delek Logistics' assets are currently integral to our refining and marketing operations.\nThe logistics segment's pipelines and transportation business owns or leases capacity on approximately 400 miles of crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 450 miles of refined product pipelines, an approximately 600-mile crude oil gathering system and associated crude oil storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately 9.6 million barrels of active shell capacity. Our logistics segment owns and operates nine light product terminals and markets light products using third-party terminals.\nRetail Overview\nAs of December 31, 2018, Delek's retail segment includes the operations of 279 owned and leased convenience store sites located primarily in central and west Texas and New Mexico which were acquired in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. Our convenience stores typically offer various grades of gasoline and diesel under the Alon brand name and food products, food service, tobacco products, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, general merchandise as well as money orders to the public, primarily under the 7-Eleven and Alon brand names pursuant to a license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. which gives us a perpetual license to use the 7-Eleven trademark, service name and trade name in west Texas and a majority of the counties in New Mexico in connection with our retail store operations. In November 2018, we terminated the license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. and the terms of such termination require the removal of all 7-Eleven branding on a store-by-store basis by the earlier of\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nDecember 31, 2021 or the date upon which our last 7-Eleven store is de-identified or closed. Merchandise sales at our convenience store sites will continue to be sold under the 7-Eleven brand name until 7-Eleven branding is removed pursuant to the termination.\nSubstantially all of the motor fuel sold through our retail segment is supplied by our Big Spring refinery, which is transferred to the retail segment at prices substantially determined by reference to published commodity pricing information.\nCorporate and Other Overview\nOur corporate activities, results of certain immaterial operating segments (including our asphalt terminal operations effective with the Delek/ Alon Merger), our non-controlling equity interest of approximately 47% of the outstanding shares in Alon (which was accounted for as an equity method investment) prior to the Delek/Alon Merger, results and assets of discontinued operations and intercompany eliminations are reported in the corporate, other and eliminations segment.\nOur 2018 Strategic Goals\nThe Company's overall strategy has been to take a disciplined approach that looks to balance returning cash to our shareholders and prudently investing in the business to support safe and reliable operations, while exploring opportunities for growth. Our goal has been to balance the different aspects of this program based on evaluations of each opportunity and how it matches our strategic goals for the company, while factoring in market conditions and expected cash generation. The following is a summary of our most significant 2018 strategic goals:\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Maintain and continue to enhance our safe operations. As we invest in and grow our business, we remain focused on safe and compliant operations for the benefit of our employees, communities, customers and shareholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Capitalize on the successful integration of the Alon transaction. During 2017 and 2018 we expended significant efforts to fully integrate the Alon organization. Now that the integration is complete, our goal is to continue to implement best practices to improve the performance of our larger organization which includes focusing on simplifying the organization structure and the balance sheet. We are continuing to realize synergies that are expected to have a positive effect on our combined operations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Build on a winning culture. During 2017 and 2018, we believe our team responded well to our larger scale, as steps were taken to integrate the two companies following the acquisition of Alon in July 2017. We are now a larger and more diverse company, but our focus is to foster a culture that has the ability to act quickly in a changing environment to take advantage of opportunities. In order to support this operation, we continue to be focused on expanding our team, developing systems and providing the resources to position the organization for success in the future.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Enhance our position in the Permian Basin. Our 302,000 barrels per day of crude throughput capacity is primarily a WTI-linked crude oil slate that is weighted to supply from the Permian Basin through our access to approximately 200,000 barrels per day. In addition, we have complementary retail and logistics presence in the area. Our strategic focus will be to evaluate options to utilize our position to create additional growth across our businesses, while working toward reducing our susceptibility to volatility in the crude and refined product markets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Grow our logistics operations. The combination of our access to the Permian Basin and larger refining operation should allow us to continue to grow our logistics footprint. We will look for opportunities to capitalize on this position to increase our crude gathering operations, support the refining system and third party customers.

We are focused on managing the cash flow in our business to support our capital allocation program that includes: 1) returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, 2) investing in our business and 3) growing through acquisitions - all of which combine to serve our central goal of increasing long-term value for our shareholders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the above, it continues to be a strategic and operational objective to manage price and supply risk related to crude oil that is used in refinery production, and to develop strategic sourcing relationships. For that purpose, from a pricing perspective, we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions, future purchases of crude oil and ethanol, future sales of refined products or to fix margins on future production. We also enter into future commitments to purchase or sell RINs at fixed prices and quantities, which are used to manage the costs associated with our RINs obligations. Additionally, from a sourcing perspective, we often enter into purchase and sale contracts with vendors and customers or take financial commodity positions for crude oil that may not be used immediately in production, but that may be used to manage the overall supply and availability of crude expected to ultimately be needed for production and/or to meet minimum requirements under strategic pipeline arrangements, and also to optimize and hedge availability risks associated with crude that we ultimately expect to use in production. Such transactions are inherently based on certain assumptions and judgments made about the current and possible future availability of crude. Therefore, when we take physical or financial positions for optimization purposes, our intent is generally to take offsetting positions in quantities and at prices that will advance these objectives while minimizing our positional and financial statement risk. However, because\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nof the volatility of the market in terms of pricing and availability, it is possible that we may have material positions with timing differences or, more rarely, that we are unable to cover a position with an offsetting position as intended. Such differences could have a material impact on the classification of resulting gains/losses, assets or liabilities, and could also significantly impact net earnings.\n2018 Strategic Developments\nWe have executed on many initiatives during 2018 that have significantly advanced our progress toward the realization of our 2018 strategic goals. As part of a larger initiative to reduce our susceptibility to volatility in crack spreads, we continued to build on our Permian Basin platform in 2018. For example, Since December 31, 2017, we have focused efforts on developing a 200-mile gathering system in the Permian Basin connecting to our Big Spring, Texas terminal. This gathering system will provide Delek with access to crude directly from wellheads which will provide improvement in refining performance and cost structure while also providing a foundation for building a new midstream income source. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 50 miles of the gathering system were completed and operational. Additionally, in September 2018, Delek announced plans for a joint venture with Energy Transfer, Magellan, and MPLX to construct a 600-mile common carrier pipeline to transport crude oil from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast region. We continue to work with our prospective partners to evaluate potential options for the development of the long-haul pipeline, including the possible combination of our project with another announced project. These developments position us to continue growing our midstream business and increase our fee-based income in that space, which will reduce our exposure to the volatility of the crude and refined product markets.\nIn our retail segment, we are actively implementing strategic initiatives to reduce our reliance on external brands and to optimize the performance of our portfolio of stores. We are rolling out our own branding initiatives which we will optimize in our current geographic areas as well as emerging markets. As a result of these efforts, we elected to terminate the 7-Eleven licensing agreement (as discussed above) with the current intention to re-brand with our own brand to capitalize on and build our brand recognition in the applicable regions. Additionally, we sold 15 under-performing or non-strategic store locations during the fourth quarter of 2018 and have plans to sell 28 additional stores during the first quarter of 2019. While the proceeds and resultant gains on sale of such related assets were not significant to our financial results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, removing these stores from our portfolio enables us to better focus our retail management and operational efforts on individual store performance, strategic optimization and growth opportunities which may include not only rebranding but possibly also expansion initiatives.\nThese significant developments were intentionally implemented to align with some of our most critical strategic initiatives for both 2018 and 2019 which include managing our risk and enhancing shareholder value by focusing on the following:\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>growing our business through new lines of business and investment in our existing businesses including capital improvements and new technology, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>identifying and managing operational and financial risks to improve operational decision-making and increase profitability.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the significant initiatives/developments described above, we entered into several other strategic transactions in order to improve our financial position or enhance shareholder value since December 31, 2017, some of the most significant of which are described below.\nTransactions designed to maximize shareholder return\n2018 and 2019 Share Repurchases\nOn January 23, 2018, Delek repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock from Alon Israel in connection with Delek's rights pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 14, 2015 by and between Delek and Alon Israel. Alon Israel delivered a right of first offer notice to Delek on January 16, 2018, informing Delek of Alon Israel's intention to sell the 2.0 million shares, and Delek accepted such offer on January 17, 2018. The total purchase price was approximately $75.3 million, or $37.64 per share. In the aggregate, pursuant to various share repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors, we have repurchased 9,022,386 shares for a total of approximately $365.3 million since December 31, 2017. As of February 22, 2019, there is approximately $409.7 million of authorization remaining under Delek's aggregate stock repurchase program (based on repurchases that had settled as of February 22, 2019). See further discussion in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFebruary 2018 Acquisition of Non-controlling Interest in Alon Partnership\nOn November 8, 2017, Delek and the Alon Partnership (as defined in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Delek agreed to acquire all of the outstanding limited partner units which Delek did not already own in an all-equity transaction. This transaction was approved by all voting members of the board of directors of the general partner of the Alon Partnership upon the recommendation from its conflicts committee and by the board of directors of Delek. This transaction closed on February 7, 2018 (the \"Merger Date\"). Delek owned approximately 51.0 million limited partner units of the Alon Partnership, or approximately 81.6% of the outstanding units immediately prior to the Merger Date. Under terms of the merger agreement, the owners of the remaining outstanding units in the Alon Partnership that Delek did not currently own immediately prior to the Merger Date received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.49 shares of New Delek common stock for each limited partner unit of the Alon Partnership, resulting in the issuance of approximately 5.6 million shares of New Delek Common Stock to the public unitholders of the Alon Partnership. The limited partner interests of the Alon Partnership prior to this acquisition were represented as common units outstanding. Because the transaction represented a combination of ownership interests under common control, the transfer of equity from non-controlling interest\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nto owned interest was recorded at carrying value and no gain or loss was recognized in connection with the transaction. See further discussion in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe acquisition of the non-controlling interest in the Alon Partnership enabled us to refocus the efforts being expended for that separate master limited partnership on a more synergistic and cohesive strategy where both the tactical operational and growth objectives of the Big Spring refinery (owned by the Alon Partnership) are fully integrated and aligned within our refining segment. Additionally, the elimination of the non-controlling public ownership allows us to channel 100% of the Alon Partnership's operational, market and financial contributions to the benefit of Delek and its shareholders.\nSeptember 2018 Settlement of Convertible Debt and Related Call Options\nOn September 17, 2018, Delek settled its Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a combination of cash and shares of New Delek Common Stock. The maturity settlement in respect of the Convertible Notes consisted of (i) cash payments totaling approximately $152.5 million which included a cash payment for outstanding principal of $150.0 million, a cash payment for accrued interest of approximately $2.2 million, a cash payment for dividends of approximately $0.3 million and a nominal cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) the issuance of approximately 2.7 million shares of New Delek Common Stock to holders of the Convertible Notes (the Conversion Shares\u201d). The issuance of the Conversion Shares was made in exchange for the Convertible Notes pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nOn September 17, 2018, we exercised the Call Options (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in connection with the settlement of the Convertible Notes and received approximately 2.7 million shares of our common stock from the Call Option counterparties, a cash payment for dividends of approximately $0.3 million and a nominal cash payment in lieu of fractional shares. See further discussion in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Convertible Notes as well as the Call Options were both assumed in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. Under the Convertible Note indenture, we had the ability, at our option, to settle the Convertible Notes with cash, with stock, or with a combination of both. Under the combination option, only the accretive value of the conversion option (the portion that was \"in-the-money\") in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes would be settled with shares. The Call Options were designed to hedge/offset the accretive value of the underlying conversion option only. After a careful review of our cash position and our objectives to minimize dilution by maximizing the effect of the Call Options, during 2018, we elected to settle the convertible debt for a combination of cash and stock. As a result, on a net basis, we were able to settle the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Call Options with no net dilution to our common stock and therefore with no dilutive impact to our earnings per share.\nNovember 2018 Warrant Unwind\nIn November 2018, Delek entered into Warrant Unwind Agreements (the \"Unwind Agreement\") with the holders of our outstanding common stock Warrants (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Pursuant to the terms of the Unwind Agreements, we settled for cash all outstanding Warrants with the holders at various prices per Warrant as provided in the Unwind Agreements. The settlement amount was based on the volume-weighted average market price of our common stock taking into account an adjustment for the exercise price of the Warrants over a period of sixteen trading days beginning November 9, 2018 (the Unwind Period\u201d). Following the Unwind Period and upon the satisfaction of the payment obligation, the Warrants were canceled and the associated rights and obligations terminated. Based on the provisions of the Unwind Agreement, the amount paid to warrant holders in satisfaction of the payment obligation totaled approximately $36 million. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAs was the case for the Convertible Notes and the Call Options, the existing common stock Warrants were also assumed in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. The Warrant agreements provided for the issuance of a certain number of warrants exchangeable for shares of our common stock at a strike price that would have become exercisable beginning in December 2018, and that have been dilutive to our earnings per share calculation during the last three quarters of 2018. By entering into this Unwind Agreement, we were able to limit the upward accretive value of the instrument to its holders and eliminate its dilutive effect, causing an immediate and significant favorable impact on earnings per share.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nTransactions designed to maximize return on assets\n2018 Disposal of California Discontinued Entities\nOn March 16, 2018, Delek sold to World Energy, LLC (i) all of Delek's membership interests in AltAir (ii) certain refining assets and other related assets located in Paramount, California and (iii) certain associated tank farm and pipeline assets and other related assets located in California. Upon final settlement, Delek expects to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $85.2 million, subject to a post-closing working capital settlement, Delek's portion of the expected biodiesel tax credit for 2017 and certain customary adjustments. The sale resulted in a loss on sale of discontinued operations totaling approximately $41.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Of the total expected proceeds, $70.4 million was received in March 2018 ($14.9 million of which were included in net cash flows from investing activities in discontinued operations), with the remainder expected to be collected upon final settlement. In connection with the sale, the remaining assets and liabilities associated with the sold operations that were not included in the assets and liabilities acquired/assumed by the buyer were reclassified into assets and liabilities held and used (relating to continuing operations) and are presented as such in our December 31, 2018 balance sheet.\nThe transaction to dispose of certain assets and liabilities associated with our Long Beach, California refinery to Bridge Point Long Beach, LLC, closed July 17, 2018 resulting in initial cash proceeds of approximately $14.5 million, net of expenses. See further discussion in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe California Discontinued Entities were acquired as part of the Delek/Alon Merger and (as discussed in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) consisted primarily of non-operating refineries as well as a small renewables facility. As part of the acquisition, we evaluated the viability of the facilities and their potential for growth and profitability measured against their current operational cost and environmental risk exposure, and a strategic decision was made to divest of these assets. Intensive efforts were made to find suitable buyers with the objective of minimizing both our losses on the sale transactions as well as any on-going environmental exposures (See discussion of environmental exposures in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and, as a result, we successfully closed on the divestitures of all of the California Discontinued Entities during 2018. We believe that the elimination of these Entities provides for the immediate elimination of the financial drain on our operating results while enabling us to divert resources that had previously been charged with managing these assets to more strategic efforts.\nMay 2018 Sale of Asphalt Assets\nOn May 21, 2018, we sold certain assets and operations of four asphalt terminals (included in Delek's corporate/other segment), as well as an equity method investment in an additional asphalt terminal, to an affiliate of Andeavor. This transaction includes asphalt terminal assets in Bakersfield, Mojave and Elk Grove, California and Phoenix, Arizona, as well as Delek's 50% equity interest in the Paramount-Nevada Asphalt Company, LLC joint venture that operates an asphalt terminal located in Fernley, Nevada. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $110.8 million, inclusive of the $75.0 million base proceeds as well as certain preliminary working capital adjustments. The assets associated with the owned terminals met the definition of held for sale pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (\"ASC 360\") as of February 1, 2018, but did not meet the definition of discontinued operations pursuant to ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations (\"ASC 205-20\") as the sale of these asphalt assets does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. Accordingly, depreciation ceased as of February 1, 2018, and the associated assets to be sold were reclassified to assets held for sale as of that date and were written down to the estimated fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment loss on assets held for sale of $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In connection with the completion of the sale transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $13.3 million in results of continuing operations on the accompanying consolidated income statement. See further discussion in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLike the California Discontinued Entities, the asphalt terminals (and related equity method investment) sold in the transaction describe above were originally acquired as part of the Delek/Alon Merger. We believe that these asphalt operations were not integral to our strategic business objectives, where maintaining focus on our core businesses and exploring growth in areas where there is opportunity to take advantage of new technology and advances in our industry as well as those opportunities with geographic customer or sourcing significance to our operations are paramount to achieving our long-term growth objectives. Therefore, we believe that divesting of these non-core operations only helps us to focus on implementing our most important strategies.\nMarch 2018 Transaction with Delek Logistics\nIn March 2018, a subsidiary of Delek Logistics completed the acquisition from Delek of storage tanks and terminals that support our Big Spring refinery in the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition (as defined in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, a new marketing agreement was entered into between subsidiary of Delek Logistics and Delek pursuant to which such subsidiary of Delek Logistics will provide marketing services for product sales from the Big Spring refinery. The cash paid for the transferred assets was $170.8 million and the cash paid for the marketing agreement was $144.2 million. The transactions were financed with borrowings under the DKL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Financial Statements).\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nWe continue to be focused on utilizing our assets to their optimal utility in the framework of our business, and that means strategically aligning our logistics assets with our Delek Logistics business. Such alignment enhances, not only Delek Logistics' growth opportunities, but also our ability to best service the mutually beneficial commercial agreements between Delek Logistics and Delek. This drop-down of logistics assets to Delek Logistics specifically contributes to our ability to provide logistics services to our Big Spring refinery while growing our logistics infrastructure and potential for synergies.\nMarch 2018 RINs Waivers\nWe consistently seek out regulatory and operational opportunities to minimize costs and thereby maximize the return on our refining assets. In March 2018, the El Dorado and Krotz Springs refineries both received approval from the EPA for a small refinery exemption from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the 2017 calendar year, which resulted in a reduction of our RINs Obligation (as defined in Note 13 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and related cost of materials and other of approximately $59.3 million and $31.6 million for the El Dorado and Krotz Springs refineries, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nTransactions designed to minimize the cost of capital/manage financial risk exposures\nMarch 30, 2018 Delek Revolver and Term Loan\nOn March 30, 2018, (the \"Closing Date\"), Delek entered into (i) a new term loan credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Term Administrative Agent\"), Delek, as borrower, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, providing for a senior secured term loan facility in an amount of $700.0 million (the \"Term Loan Credit Facility\") and (ii) a second amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Revolver Administrative Agent\"), Delek, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of Delek, as guarantors, and the other lenders party thereto, providing for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with commitments of $1.0 billion (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\" and, together with the \"Term Loan Credit Facility,\" the \"New Credit Facilities\") - see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Financial Statements, for additional information. The Term Loan Credit Facility was drawn in full for $700.0 million on the Closing Date at an original issue discount of 0.50%. Proceeds under the Term Loan Credit Facility, as well as proceeds of approximately $300.0 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Closing Date, were used to repay certain indebtedness of Delek and its subsidiaries (the Refinancing\u201d), as well as certain fees, costs and expenses in connection with the closing of the New Credit Facilities, with any remaining proceeds held in cash. Proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of Delek and its subsidiaries. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the Refinancing. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Refinancing consolidated many of our facilities providing not only a more simplified borrowing structure but also expanding our borrowing capacity with interest rates that reflect our strengthened financial position and broadened asset base. Additionally, our covenant requirements under the Refinancing arrangements are less complex and therefore better allow us to manage our covenant compliance risk.\n2018 and 2019 Amendments to Supply and Offtake Agreements\nEffective December 21, 2018, we amended our Big Spring refinery's Supply and Offtake Agreement with J. Aron so that the repurchase of baseline volumes at the end of the Supply and Offtake Agreement term (representing the \"Baseline Step-Out Liability\") will be based upon a fixed price instead of a market-indexed price. The modified arrangement results in a Baseline Step-Out Liability that is no longer subject to commodity volatility, but for which its fair value is subject to interest rate risk. As a result, we recorded a gain on the change in fair value resulting from the modification of the instruments from commodities-based risk to interest rate risk in cost of materials and other totaling approximately $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Baseline Step-Out Liability under the Big Spring refinery's Supply and Offtake Agreement represents the fixed notional amount outstanding under the Supply and Offtake Agreement of $52.0 million less the unamortized discount of $2.4 million for a fair value of $49.6 million related to 0.8 million barrels of baseline consigned inventory, and is reflected as a non-current obligation on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Such Baseline Step-Out Liabilities will continue to be recorded at fair value, where the fair value will reflect changes in interest rate risk rather than commodity price risk. See further discussion in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDuring January 2019, we also amended the El Dorado refinery and the Krotz Springs refinery Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron so that the repurchase of baseline volumes at the end of the Supply and Offtake Agreement term (representing the Baseline Step-Out Liabilities) will be based upon a fixed price instead of a market-indexed price and therefore subject to changes in fair value that reflect changes in interest rate risk rather than commodity price risk. See further discussion in Note 24 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nA Look to the Future: Our Strategic Goals\nSeveral of our 2018 strategic goals continue to factor into our overall strategy. We still intend to focus on long-term shareholder returns; to have significant organic growth by identifying and capitalizing on margin improvement opportunities; to maintain financial flexibility to achieve the operational, capital and transactional objectives that are important to our sustainability and long-term growth; to continue to grow and develop complementary logistics systems; and to focus efforts on our Permian refining system, all of which contribute to thriving as an integrated and diversified refining, logistics and marketing company.\nDuring 2018, Delek's leadership team built a new framework to facilitate development of the Company's strategies and initiatives. This framework starts with the Company's overarching objectives for the next five years:\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>I.\n</td> <td>Become nationally recognized for safety and wellness leadership,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>II.\n</td> <td>Maximize return on assets through best-in-industry reliability and integrity,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>III.\n</td> <td>Improve efficiency and execution through development of systems and processes,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IV.\n</td> <td>Identify and manage risks to improve decision making and increase profitability, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>V.\n</td> <td>Significantly increase overall earnings.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> These overarching objectives are supported by five strategic focuses, which inform the priorities of each segment's initiatives, as discussed below:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>I.\n</td> <td>Safety and wellness. In the refining environment, safety is always of paramount concern. But safety, and wellness, are also critical to maximizing productivity and optimizing the use of our team members' talents and capital assets, our two most valuable resources. For these reasons, safety and wellness have become an enterprise-wide, pervasive mantra in our culture that is already resulting in fewer injuries and less downtime. For 2019, our initiatives are centered around awareness and developing programs with our employees' input to guide and support all of the business units. We believe these cultural programs will drive continued reductions in work-related recordable injuries and move us toward becoming first in class with respect to safety and wellness.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>II.\n</td> <td>Reliability and integrity. We are focused on improving refinery system availability through top-tiered maintenance and equipment monitoring, and minimizing environmental releases by exploring new technologies and methods for monitoring and correcting failures before they result in releases. But this objective reaches beyond our refining and logistics operations. We are also committed to improving the reliability and integrity of our internal information and organizational infrastructure, with a specific emphasis on information technology as well as other functions that support the operating business units.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>III.\n</td> <td>Systems and processes.

Historically, our profitability has been affected by commodity price volatility, specifically as it relates to the price of crude oil and refined products.\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average prices of WTI Midland crude oil for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average prices of WTI Cushing crude oil for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread (Tyler and El Dorado benchmark) for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread (Big Spring benchmark) for the past three years, where we have owned the Big Spring refinery only since the Delek/Alon Merger.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 2-1-1 crack spread (Krotz Springs benchmark) for the past three years, where we have owned the Krotz Springs refinery only since the Delek/Alon Merger.\nThe market price of refined products contributed to the increase in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread to $13.21 in 2018 from $13.01 in 2017, with the Gulf Coast price of gasoline (CBOB) increasing 18.0%, from an average of $1.55 per gallon in 2017 to $1.83 per gallon in 2018. The Gulf Coast price of High Sulfur Diesel increased 30.8%, from an average of $1.47 per gallon in 2017 to $1.92 per gallon in 2018. The Gulf Coast price of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel increased 26.3% from an average of $1.62 per gallon in 2017 to $2.05 per gallon in 2018. The charts below illustrate the quarterly high, low and average prices of Gulf Coast Gasoline, U.S. High Sulfur Diesel and U.S. Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel over the past three years.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAs US crude oil production has increased, we have seen the discount for WTI Cushing widen compared to Brent. This generally leads to higher margins in our refineries as refined product prices are influenced by Brent crude prices and the majority of our crude supply is WTI-linked. The discount for WTI Cushing compared to Brent increased to $6.49 during 2018 from $3.95 during 2017. We note similar historical trends when reviewing the average discount for LLS compared to WTI Cushing, where the average discount increased to $4.99 during 2018 from $3.23 during 2017. Additionally, our refineries continue to have greater access to WTI Midland and WTI Midland-linked crude feedstocks compared to certain of our competitors. The average discount for WTI Midland compared to WTI Cushing increased to $7.36 during 2018 from $0.34 during 2017. As these price discounts increase, so does our competitive advantage, created by our access to WTI-linked crude oil. The chart below illustrates the differentials of both Brent crude oil and WTI Midland crude oil as compared to WTI Cushing crude oil as well as WTI Cushing as compared to LLS over the past three years.\nEnvironmental regulations continue to affect our margins in the form of the increasing RINs cost. On a consolidated basis, we work to balance our RINs obligations in order to minimize the effect of RINs on our results. While we generate RINs in both of our refining and logistics segments through our ethanol blending and biodiesel production, our refining segment needs to purchase additional RINs to satisfy its obligations. As a result, increases in the price of RINs generally adversely affect our results of operations. It is not possible at this time to predict with certainty what future volumes or costs may be, but given the increase in required volumes and the volatile price of RINs, the cost of purchasing sufficient RINs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are unable to recover those costs in the price of our refined products. The chart below illustrates the volatile nature of the price for RINs over the past three years.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nSummary Financial and Other Information\nThe following table provides summary financial data for Delek (in millions):\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Summary Statement of Operations Data\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018(1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,233.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,267.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,197.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,621.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,086.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,247.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>611.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>180.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total non-operating expenses (income), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(119.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>342.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>485.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>299.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(391.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>101.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(29.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(171.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>383.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>328.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(219.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(8.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>374.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(133.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributed to non-controlling interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) attributable to Delek\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>340.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>288.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(153.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a $5.5 million adjustment to increase income tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and to decrease net income and net income attributable to Delek, and reducing basic and diluted income per share by $0.07 and $0.06, respectively, that were not reflected in the Earnings Release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019 (the \"Earnings Release\"). Such adjustment has no impact on adjusted net income or adjusted net income per share (as defined in the Earnings Release).

Consolidated net income attributable to Delek for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $340.1 million, or $4.11 per basic share, compared to $288.8 million, or $4.04 per basic share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Explanations for significant drivers impacting net income as compared to the comparable period of the prior year are discussed in the sections below.\n2017 vs. 2016\nConsolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $322.6 million compared to a net loss of $133.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.

The Tax Reform Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, provides for immediate deduction of qualified capital assets placed in service, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.At December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Reform Act on our existing deferred tax balances, and recognized a provisional benefit amount of $166.9 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21% for federal purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the analysis of the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act, resulting in our recording of an additional tax benefit of $0.6 million during 2018. These adjustments to the previously recorded provisional amounts include the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and executive compensation.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $101.9 million and $(29.2) million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase in expense of $131.1 million.

We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our available debt facilities.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows (in millions):\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Flow Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>560.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>319.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>248.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>200.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(297.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(104.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>137.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>387.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $560.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $319.7 million for the comparable period of 2017. The increase in cash flows from operations was partially due to an increase in net income, which for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $374.9 million, compared to $322.6 million in the same period of 2017. A decrease in cash used to purchase inventory and other current assets and increase in cash received on accounts receivable also contributed to the increase in cash flows from operations. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2017, net income included a non-cash gain on remeasurement of equity method investment of $190.1 million for which there was no comparable activity in the current period. This increase was partially offset by increases in cash used to pay accounts payable and other current liabilities and obligation under the supply and offtake agreement with J. Aron. Additionally partially offsetting the increase, net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a non-cash benefit of deferred income taxes of $26.8 million compared to expense of $48.0 million in the prior year.\nYTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $319.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $248.0 million for 2016. The increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to an increase in net income for 2017 of $322.6 million, compared to net loss of $133.4 million in 2016 and a decrease in cash used to pay the obligation under the supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron of $113.0 million, partially offset by the non-cash gain on the remeasurement of the equity method investment in Alon of $190.1 million and increases in accounts receivable and inventory and other non-current assets. The net loss in 2016 included a non-cash impairment in our equity method investment in Alon USA of $245.3 million. Additionally, the disposed retail segment provided $13.3 million of cash flows from operations in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\nNet cash used in investing activities was $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net cash provided of $37.6 million in the comparable period of 2017. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment, which increased from $172.0 million in 2017, to $322.0 million in 2018, and a $11.2 million decrease in distributions received from equity method investments. Additionally, $200.5 million in cash (excluding the cash acquired attributable to the California Discontinued Entities) was acquired in 2017 with the Delek/Alon Merger. This decrease was partially offset by proceeds from sales of discontinued operations of $55.5 million and proceeds from the sale of asphalt assets of $110.8 million received in 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nYTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $200.7 million in 2016. This decrease in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment, which increased from $46.3 million in 2016 to $172.0 million in 2017. Additionally, the disposed retail segment provided $288.9 million of cash flows from investing activities in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017, while the California Discontinued Entities provided $12.2 million of cash flows from investing activities in 2017 . This decrease was partially offset by the the cash acquired in the Delek/Alon Merger of $200.5 million (excluding the cash acquired attributable to the California Discontinued Entities) and a decrease in equity method contributions of $55.8 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $297.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to cash used of $104.6 million in the comparable 2017 period. We completed the Refinancing transaction as well as extinguished the Convertible Notes during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from long-term revolvers of $2,124.6 million and proceeds from term debt of $690.6 million, offset by payments on long-term revolvers of $1,679.8 million, payment on term debt of $826.3 million, deferred financing costs paid of $13.8 million, repayment of product financing agreements of $72.4 million, repurchase of common stock of $365.3 million and increases in dividends paid to $80.1 million compared to $44.0 million in the comparable 2017 period.\nYTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nNet cash used in financing activities was $104.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $61.7 million for 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to net repayments under our revolving credit facilities of $117.7 million in 2017, compared to $41.1 million in 2016, an increase in repurchases of common stock of $19.0 million, an increase in distributions to non-controlling interest of $11.6 million, an increase in dividends paid of $6.5 million, and an increase in deferred financing costs paid of $4.4 million, offset by net borrowings under our term loans of $182.6 million during 2017 compared to net repayments of $14.7 million in 2016 and an increase in proceeds net of repayments associated with product financing agreements of $52.3 million. Additionally, the disposed retail segment used $17.5 million of cash flows from financing activities associated with debt repayments in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017.\nCash Position and Indebtedness\nAs of December 31, 2018, our total cash and cash equivalents were $1,079.3 million and we had total indebtedness of approximately $1,783.3 million. Total unused credit commitments or borrowing base availability, as applicable, under our three separate revolving credit facilities was approximately $913.9 million, and we had letters of credit issued of approximately $179.4 million. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants in all debt facilities as of December 31, 2018.\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our credit facilities.\nCapital Spending\nA key component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program.

We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader's understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control.\nLIFO Inventory\nThe Tyler refinery's inventory consists of crude oil, refined petroleum products and blendstocks which are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the last-in, first-out LIFO valuation method. The LIFO method requires management to make estimates on an interim basis of the anticipated year-end inventory quantities, which could differ from actual quantities.\nWe believe the accounting estimate related to the establishment of anticipated year-end LIFO inventory is a critical accounting estimate, because it requires management to make assumptions about future production rates in the Tyler refinery, the future buying patterns of our customers, as well as numerous other factors beyond our control, including the economic viability of the general economy, weather conditions, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. The impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates could be material to the inventories reported on our quarterly balance sheets, and the impact on the results reported in our quarterly statements of income could be material. In selecting assumed inventory levels, we use historical trending of production and sales, recognition of current market indicators of future pricing and value and new regulatory requirements which might impact inventory levels. Management's assumptions require significant judgment because actual year-end inventory levels have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so.\nAt each year-end, actual physical inventory levels are used to calculate both ending inventory balances and final cost of materials and other for the year.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite Life Intangibles Impairment\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present, we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset, undiscounted and without interest charges. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. We use quoted market prices when available and our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount, an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset. We recognized an impairment charge of $2.7 million in 2016 related to the write-down of certain idle refining equipment in our refining segment to net realizable value. This impairment charge is included in other operating income in our consolidated statement of income for the period. There were no such impairment charges in 2018 and 2017.\nGoodwill and Potential Impairment\nGoodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as disruptions in our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results or a sustained market capitalization decline. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value (Step 1), the impairment assessment leads to the testing of the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount (Step 2). If the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2017-04 (which we adopted during the fourth quarter of 2018, as permitted by the ASU), Step 2 is no longer required, but rather any impairment is determined based on the results of Step 1.\nIn assessing the recoverability of goodwill, assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. We may consider inputs such as a market participant weighted average cost of capital, estimated growth rates for revenue, gross profit and capital expenditures based on history and our best estimate of future forecasts, all of which are subject to significant judgment and estimates. We may also estimate the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows, such as those used by third-party analysts. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, due to factors such as a decline in general economic conditions, competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond management's control, an impairment charge may be required. A significant risk to our future results and the potential future impairment of goodwill is the volatility of the crude oil and the refined product markets which is often unpredictable and may negatively impact our results of operations in ways that cannot be anticipated and that are beyond management's control.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOur annual assessment of goodwill did not result in impairment during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nIt is our policy to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities represent the current estimated costs to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties. This estimate is based on internal and third-party assessments of the extent of the contamination, the selected remediation technology and review of applicable environmental regulations, typically considering estimated activities and costs for 15 years, and up to 30 years if a longer period is believed reasonably necessary. Accruals for estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and include, but are not limited to, costs to perform remedial actions and costs of machinery and equipment that are dedicated to the remedial actions and that do not have an alternative use. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. We discount environmental liabilities to their present value if payments are fixed and determinable. Expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized.\nChanges in laws and regulations and actual remediation expenses compared to historical experience could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nDelek recognizes liabilities which represent the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities, including those that are conditional on a future event, when the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liability's fair value.\nIn the refining segment, we have asset retirement obligations with respect to our refineries due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of these assets at the time they are retired. However, the majority of these assets can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time provided that they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and intent to continue to maintain these assets and make improvements based on technological advances. In the logistics segment, these obligations relate to the required cleanout of the pipeline and terminal tanks and removal of certain above-grade portions of the pipeline situated on right-of-way property. In the retail segment, we have asset retirement obligations related to the removal of underground storage tanks and the removal of brand signage at owned and leased retail sites which are legally required under the applicable leases. The asset retirement obligation for storage tank removal on leased retail sites is accreted over the expected life of the owned retail site or the average retail site lease term.\nIn order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligations. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\nDisclosures, Financial Statements, and Changes in Disagreements", "item_7_truncated": "YTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nTable 269: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>915.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of materials and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>755.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>350.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contribution margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Information:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of stores (end of period)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average number of stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>302\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail fuel sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>571.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>251.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail fuel sales (thousands of gallons)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>217,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>107,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average retail gallons per average number of stores (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>801\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average retail sales price per gallon sold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Retail fuel margin ($ per gallon)(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>339.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>174.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise sales per average number of stores\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Merchandise margin %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expense/merchandise sales plus total gallons\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have executed on many initiatives during 2018 that have significantly advanced our progress toward the realization of our 2018 strategic goals. As part of a larger initiative to reduce our susceptibility to volatility in crack spreads, we continued to build on our Permian Basin platform in 2018. For example, Since December 31, 2017, we have focused efforts on developing a 200-mile gathering system in the Permian Basin connecting to our Big Spring, Texas terminal. This gathering system will provide Delek with access to crude directly from wellheads which will provide improvement in refining performance and cost structure while also providing a foundation for building a new midstream income source. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 50 miles of the gathering system were completed and operational. Additionally, in September 2018, Delek announced plans for a joint venture with Energy Transfer, Magellan, and MPLX to construct a 600-mile common carrier pipeline to transport crude oil from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast region. We continue to work with our prospective partners to evaluate potential options for the development of the long-haul pipeline, including the possible combination of our project with another announced project. These developments position us to continue growing our midstream business and increase our fee-based income in that space, which will reduce our exposure to the volatility of the crude and refined product markets.\nTransactions designed to minimize the cost of capital/manage financial risk exposures\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nNet cash used in investing activities was $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net cash provided of $37.6 million in the comparable period of 2017. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment, which increased from $172.0 million in 2017, to $322.0 million in 2018, and a $11.2 million decrease in distributions received from equity method investments. Additionally, $200.5 million in cash (excluding the cash acquired attributable to the California Discontinued Entities) was acquired in 2017 with the Delek/Alon Merger. This decrease was partially offset by proceeds from sales of discontinued operations of $55.5 million and proceeds from the sale of asphalt assets of $110.8 million received in 2018.\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of refined products in the logistics segment where the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased increased $0.23 per gallon and $0.45 per gallon, respectively.

In March 2018, the Krotz Springs refinery received such approval as well, which resulted in a reduction of our RINs Obligation and related cost of materials and other of approximately $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  2017 vs. 2016\nContribution margin increased by $47.9 million, or 39.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI- Cushing crude oil from an average of $43.33 per barrel for 2016 to an average of $50.78 during 2017,; and \n \u2022 Use our financial flexibility and cash flow to create shareholder value. We are focused on managing the cash flow in our business to support our capital allocation program that includes: 1) returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, 2) investing in our business and 3) growing through acquisitions - all of which combine to serve our central goal of increasing long-term value for our shareholders. \nIn the refining segment, we have asset retirement obligations with respect to our refineries due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of these assets at the time they are retired. However, the majority of these assets can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time provided that they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and intent to continue to maintain these assets and make improvements based on technological advances. In the logistics segment, these obligations relate to the required cleanout of the pipeline and terminal tanks and removal of certain above-grade portions of the pipeline situated on right-of-way property. In the retail segment, we have asset retirement obligations related to the removal of underground storage tanks and the removal of brand signage at owned and leased retail sites which are legally required under the applicable leases. The asset retirement obligation for storage tank removal on leased retail sites is accreted over the expected life of the owned retail site or the average retail site lease term.\n \u2022 addition of assumed debt totaling $568.0 million (at fair value) in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger; and \n \u2022 deterioration of creditworthiness or overall financial condition of a material counterparty (or counterparties); \nCash Position and Indebtedness\nThe acquisition of the non-controlling interest in the Alon Partnership enabled us to refocus the efforts being expended for that separate master limited partnership on a more synergistic and cohesive strategy where both the tactical operational and growth objectives of the Big Spring refinery (owned by the Alon Partnership) are fully integrated and aligned within our refining segment. Additionally, the elimination of the non-controlling public ownership allows us to channel 100% of the Alon Partnership's operational, market and financial contributions to the benefit of Delek and its shareholders.\n \u2022 a 1.5% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread; \n \u2022 the cost of materials and other benefit attributable to the RIN waivers.  2017 vs. 2016\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows (in millions):\nCorporate and Other Overview\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nContribution margin for the retail segment increased by $32.1 million, a 119.8% improvement in contribution margin percentage, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nRetail Segment\nAdditionally, other expense (income), net was $(7.3) million and $(6.1) million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1.2 million. The increase was primarily driven by the following immaterial changes:\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; and \n \u2022 increase in net revenues included the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; and \nAt each year-end, actual physical inventory levels are used to calculate both ending inventory balances and final cost of materials and other for the year.\n \u2022 changes in the cost or availability of transportation for feedstocks and refined products; and \nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe tables and charts below set forth certain information concerning our refining segment operations ($ in millions, except per barrel amounts):\n III. Systems and processes.

The Term Loan Credit Facility was drawn in full for $700.0 million on the Closing Date at an original issue discount of 0.50%. Proceeds under the Term Loan Credit Facility, as well as proceeds of approximately $300.0 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Closing Date, were used to repay certain indebtedness of Delek and its subsidiaries (the Refinancing\u201d), as well as certain fees, costs and expenses in connection with the closing of the New Credit Facilities, with any remaining proceeds held in cash. Proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of Delek and its subsidiaries. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the Refinancing.

We still intend to focus on long-term shareholder returns; to have significant organic growth by identifying and capitalizing on margin improvement opportunities; to maintain financial flexibility to achieve the operational, capital and transactional objectives that are important to our sustainability and long-term growth; to continue to grow and develop complementary logistics systems; and to focus efforts on our Permian refining system, all of which contribute to thriving as an integrated and diversified refining, logistics and marketing company.\n(4) Balances consist of contractual obligations under agreements with third parties (not including Delek Logistics) for the transportation of crude oil to our refineries.\n \u2022 risks and uncertainties with respect to the quantities and costs of refined petroleum products supplied to our pipelines and/or held in our terminals; \nNet cash provided by financing activities was $297.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to cash used of $104.6 million in the comparable 2017 period. We completed the Refinancing transaction as well as extinguished the Convertible Notes during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from long-term revolvers of $2,124.6 million and proceeds from term debt of $690.6 million, offset by payments on long-term revolvers of $1,679.8 million, payment on term debt of $826.3 million, deferred financing costs paid of $13.8 million, repayment of product financing agreements of $72.4 million, repurchase of common stock of $365.3 million and increases in dividends paid to $80.1 million compared to $44.0 million in the comparable 2017 period.\nNet revenues increased by $119.5 million, or 22.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the following:\nWe recognized proceeds from business interruption insurance claims of $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, associated with a litigation settlement. We did not record any insurance proceeds for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.\n2018 vs. 2017\n II. Reliability and integrity. We are focused on improving refinery system availability through top-tiered maintenance and equipment monitoring, and minimizing environmental releases by exploring new technologies and methods for monitoring and correcting failures before they result in releases. But this objective reaches beyond our refining and logistics operations. We are also committed to improving the reliability and integrity of our internal information and organizational infrastructure, with a specific emphasis on information technology as well as other functions that support the operating business units. \n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI - Midland crude oil, from an average of $43.25 per barrel for 2016 to an average of $50.44 during 2017.  These increases were partially offset by the following:\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 transaction costs related to the Delek/Alon Merger incurred by the Company totaled approximately $24.7 million, inclusive of $10.1 million of merger costs and $14.7 million of non-recurring costs associated with the transaction for the year ended December 31, 2017. \n \u2022 increases in outside services expenses related to maintenance projects on certain of our pipelines and tanks.  2017 vs. 2016\n \u2022 increased fees associated with the marketing agreement as described above.  These increases were partially offset by the following:\nGoodwill and Potential Impairment\nMay 2018 Sale of Asphalt Assets\nOn September 17, 2018, Delek settled its Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a combination of cash and shares of New Delek Common Stock. The maturity settlement in respect of the Convertible Notes consisted of (i) cash payments totaling approximately $152.5 million which included a cash payment for outstanding principal of $150.0 million, a cash payment for accrued interest of approximately $2.2 million, a cash payment for dividends of approximately $0.3 million and a nominal cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) the issuance of approximately 2.7 million shares of New Delek Common Stock to holders of the Convertible Notes (the Conversion Shares\u201d). The issuance of the Conversion Shares was made in exchange for the Convertible Notes pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our portfolio of businesses and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that, if consummated, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\n \u2022 a decline in fees on our Paline Pipeline System as described above. \n \u2022 addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017. \nGeneral and administrative expenses were $175.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $106.1 million in 2016, an increase of $69.8 million, or 65.8%. The overall increase was primarily driven by the following factors:\n2018 vs. 2017\n2018 vs. 2017\nIn addition to the above, it continues to be a strategic and operational objective to manage price and supply risk related to crude oil that is used in refinery production, and to develop strategic sourcing relationships. For that purpose, from a pricing perspective, we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions, future purchases of crude oil and ethanol, future sales of refined products or to fix margins on future production. We also enter into future commitments to purchase or sell RINs at fixed prices and quantities, which are used to manage the costs associated with our RINs obligations. Additionally, from a sourcing perspective, we often enter into purchase and sale contracts with vendors and customers or take financial commodity positions for crude oil that may not be used immediately in production, but that may be used to manage the overall supply and availability of crude expected to ultimately be needed for production and/or to meet minimum requirements under strategic pipeline arrangements, and also to optimize and hedge availability risks associated with crude that we ultimately expect to use in production. Such transactions are inherently based on certain assumptions and judgments made about the current and possible future availability of crude. Therefore, when we take physical or financial positions for optimization purposes, our intent is generally to take offsetting positions in quantities and at prices that will advance these objectives while minimizing our positional and financial statement risk. However, because\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 the disposal of an equity method investment associated with the sale of asphalt terminals during the year ended December 31, 2018.  2017 vs. 2016\n \u2022 higher maintenance and other costs associated with outages at the refineries; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, Delek's retail segment includes the operations of 279 owned and leased convenience store sites located primarily in central and west Texas and New Mexico which were acquired in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. Our convenience stores typically offer various grades of gasoline and diesel under the Alon brand name and food products, food service, tobacco products, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, general merchandise as well as money orders to the public, primarily under the 7-Eleven and Alon brand names pursuant to a license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. which gives us a perpetual license to use the 7-Eleven trademark, service name and trade name in west Texas and a majority of the counties in New Mexico in connection with our retail store operations. In November 2018, we terminated the license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. and the terms of such termination require the removal of all 7-Eleven branding on a store-by-store basis by the earlier of\n \u2022 increases in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased in our west Texas marketing operations. The average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased increased $0.23 per gallon and $0.45 per gallon, respectively, which amounted to an increase of $72.6 million in cost of materials and other. The increase in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel was partially offset by a decrease in volumes sold amounting to $13.5 million and hedging gains of $4.8 million.  2017 vs. 2016\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 improved contribution margin in our west Texas operations as a result of continued increased drilling activity in the region and favorable market price movements; and \nA key component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $317.2 million, of which approximately $203.9 million was spent in our refining segment, $11.6 million in our logistics segment, $10.0 million in our retail segment and $91.7 million at the holding company level. The following table summarizes our actual capital expenditures for 2018 and planned capital expenditures for 2019 by operating segment and major category (in millions):\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe Convertible Notes as well as the Call Options were both assumed in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. Under the Convertible Note indenture, we had the ability, at our option, to settle the Convertible Notes with cash, with stock, or with a combination of both. Under the combination option, only the accretive value of the conversion option (the portion that was \"in-the-money\") in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes would be settled with shares. The Call Options were designed to hedge/offset the accretive value of the underlying conversion option only. After a careful review of our cash position and our objectives to minimize dilution by maximizing the effect of the Call Options, during 2018, we elected to settle the convertible debt for a combination of cash and stock. As a result, on a net basis, we were able to settle the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Call Options with no net dilution to our common stock and therefore with no dilutive impact to our earnings per share.\n \u2022 a reduction in cost of materials and other attributable to a decrease in average RIN prices and RIN waivers received which resulted in an incremental net reduction of such costs as compared to the prior year.  2017 vs. 2016\n I. Safety and wellness. In the refining environment, safety is always of paramount concern. But safety, and wellness, are also critical to maximizing productivity and optimizing the use of our team members' talents and capital assets, our two most valuable resources. For these reasons, safety and wellness have become an enterprise-wide, pervasive mantra in our culture that is already resulting in fewer injuries and less downtime. For 2019, our initiatives are centered around awareness and developing programs with our employees' input to guide and support all of the business units. We believe these cultural programs will drive continued reductions in work-related recordable injuries and move us toward becoming first in class with respect to safety and wellness. \nContribution Margin\nYTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nNovember 2018 Warrant Unwind\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 improvements in average sales price of retail fuel per gallon to $2.63 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.34 during the six months ended December 31, 2017. \nCost of materials and other was $8,560.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $6,327.6 million for 2017, an increase of $2,232.9 million, or 35.3%. The increase in cost of materials and other primarily related to the following factors:\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI- Cushing crude oil from an average of $50.78 per barrel for 2017 to an average of $65.20 during 2018; and \nRefining Margin\nLike the California Discontinued Entities, the asphalt terminals (and related equity method investment) sold in the transaction describe above were originally acquired as part of the Delek/Alon Merger. We believe that these asphalt operations were not integral to our strategic business objectives, where maintaining focus on our core businesses and exploring growth in areas where there is opportunity to take advantage of new technology and advances in our industry as well as those opportunities with geographic customer or sourcing significance to our operations are paramount to achieving our long-term growth objectives. Therefore, we believe that divesting of these non-core operations only helps us to focus on implementing our most important strategies.\n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results. \nNet Income\n \u2022 net increases in sales volumes in our refining and logistics segments during 2017. \n \u2022 the effects of increases in the price of finished petroleum products at our refineries (including a 19.7% increase in average price of CBOB gasoline per gallon and a 22.8% increase in average price of ULSD per gallon); and \n2018 vs. 2017\n2017 vs. 2016\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved. Forward-looking information is based on information available at the time and/or management's good faith belief with respect to future events, and is subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual performance or results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. Important factors that, individually or in the aggregate, could cause such differences include, but are not limited to:\nOperating expenses increased by $6.1 million, or 16.4% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by the following:\nOperating expenses (included in both cost of sales and other operating expenses) were $429.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $249.3 million in 2016, an increase of $179.7 million, or 72.1%. The increase in operating expenses is primarily driven by the following:\nCost of materials and other was $6,327.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3,812.9 million for 2016, an increase of $2,514.7 million, or 66.0%. The increase in cost of materials and other was primarily due to the following factors:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nContribution Margin\nNet Revenues\nOperating expenses increased by $15.4 million, or 35.6%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\n (1) Total sales volume includes 986, 1,592 and 622 bpd sold to the logistics segment during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total sales volume also includes sales of 193, 129 and 510 bpd of intermediate and finished products to the El Dorado refinery during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total sales volume also includes 399 and 546 bpd of produced finished product sold to the Big Spring refinery for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 232 bpd sold to the Krotz Springs refinery during the year ended December 31, 2018. Total sales volume excludes 4,444, 4,209 and 1,281 bpd of wholesale activity during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n \u2022 diminution in value of long-lived assets may result in an impairment in the carrying value of the assets on our balance sheet and a resultant loss recognized in the statement of operations; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 increases in labor and utilities costs associated with certain of our pipelines as a result of increased usage; \nWe are an integrated downstream energy business focused on petroleum refining, the transportation, storage and wholesale distribution of crude oil, intermediate and refined products and convenience store retailing. Effective July 1, 2017, we acquired through the Delek/Alon the operations and net assets of Alon, as discussed in the 'Recent Strategic Developments' section of Item 1, Business, and as discussed in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Delek/Alon Merger continues to have a significant impact on our revenue and profitability as well as earnings per share, our net asset position, our purchasing position in the marketplace, our footprint in the refining industry, especially in the Gulf Coast Region/Permian Basin, and our ability to go to market and secure financing, and we continue to realize synergies from our combined operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $319.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $248.0 million for 2016. The increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to an increase in net income for 2017 of $322.6 million, compared to net loss of $133.4 million in 2016 and a decrease in cash used to pay the obligation under the supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron of $113.0 million, partially offset by the non-cash gain on the remeasurement of the equity method investment in Alon of $190.1 million and increases in accounts receivable and inventory and other non-current assets. The net loss in 2016 included a non-cash impairment in our equity method investment in Alon USA of $245.3 million. Additionally, the disposed retail segment provided $13.3 million of cash flows from operations in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017.\n (1) Retail fuel margin represents gross margin on fuel sales in the retail segment, and is calculated as retail fuel sales revenue less retail fuel cost of sales. The retail fuel margin per gallon calculation is derived by dividing retail fuel margin by the total retail fuel gallons sold for the period. \nOn November 8, 2017, Delek and the Alon Partnership (as defined in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Delek agreed to acquire all of the outstanding limited partner units which Delek did not already own in an all-equity transaction. This transaction was approved by all voting members of the board of directors of the general partner of the Alon Partnership upon the recommendation from its conflicts committee and by the board of directors of Delek. This transaction closed on February 7, 2018 (the \"Merger Date\"). Delek owned approximately 51.0 million limited partner units of the Alon Partnership, or approximately 81.6% of the outstanding units immediately prior to the Merger Date. Under terms of the merger agreement, the owners of the remaining outstanding units in the Alon Partnership that Delek did not currently own immediately prior to the Merger Date received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.49 shares of New Delek common stock for each limited partner unit of the Alon Partnership, resulting in the issuance of approximately 5.6 million shares of New Delek Common Stock to the public unitholders of the Alon Partnership. The limited partner interests of the Alon Partnership prior to this acquisition were represented as common units outstanding. Because the transaction represented a combination of ownership interests under common control, the transfer of equity from non-controlling interest\nCost of Materials and Other\nIn March 2018, a subsidiary of Delek Logistics completed the acquisition from Delek of storage tanks and terminals that support our Big Spring refinery in the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition (as defined in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, a new marketing agreement was entered into between subsidiary of Delek Logistics and Delek pursuant to which such subsidiary of Delek Logistics will provide marketing services for product sales from the Big Spring refinery. The cash paid for the transferred assets was $170.8 million and the cash paid for the marketing agreement was $144.2 million. The transactions were financed with borrowings under the DKL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Financial Statements).\n \u2022 increased net revenue related to the Paline Pipeline as a result of volume increases on the pipeline.  Net revenues included $33.0 million and $20.4 million of net service fees paid by our refining segment to our logistics segment during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These service fees are based on the number of gallons sold and a shared portion of the margin achieved in return for providing sales and customer support services, and includes fees earned under the marketing agreement entered into in connection with the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition. Net revenues also included crude and refined product transportation, terminalling and storage fees paid by our refining segment to our logistics segment, which includes revenues earned under the commercial agreements entered into in connection with the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition. These fees were $200.4 million and $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The logistics segment received management fees of $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from the Corporate/Other segment for the management of a long-term capital project on behalf of the Company for the construction of a gathering system in the Permian Basin, as discussed further in Note 4 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The logistics segment also sold $2.6 million and $5.6 million of RINs to the refining segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These intercompany sales and fees are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAs US crude oil production has increased, we have seen the discount for WTI Cushing widen compared to Brent. This generally leads to higher margins in our refineries as refined product prices are influenced by Brent crude prices and the majority of our crude supply is WTI-linked. The discount for WTI Cushing compared to Brent increased to $6.49 during 2018 from $3.95 during 2017. We note similar historical trends when reviewing the average discount for LLS compared to WTI Cushing, where the average discount increased to $4.99 during 2018 from $3.23 during 2017. Additionally, our refineries continue to have greater access to WTI Midland and WTI Midland-linked crude feedstocks compared to certain of our competitors. The average discount for WTI Midland compared to WTI Cushing increased to $7.36 during 2018 from $0.34 during 2017. As these price discounts increase, so does our competitive advantage, created by our access to WTI-linked crude oil. The chart below illustrates the differentials of both Brent crude oil and WTI Midland crude oil as compared to WTI Cushing crude oil as well as WTI Cushing as compared to LLS over the past three years.\nConsolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $322.6 million compared to a net loss of $133.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated net income attributable to Delek for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $288.8 million, or $4.04 per basic share, compared to a net loss of $153.7 million, or $2.49 per basic share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Explanations for significant drivers impacting net income as compared to the comparable period of the prior year are discussed in the sections below.\n \u2022 an increase in employee related costs resulting from increases in incentive plan costs and the addition of employees in connection with the integration of the acquisition of Alon; and \nNet cash used in financing activities was $104.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $61.7 million for 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to net repayments under our revolving credit facilities of $117.7 million in 2017, compared to $41.1 million in 2016, an increase in repurchases of common stock of $19.0 million, an increase in distributions to non-controlling interest of $11.6 million, an increase in dividends paid of $6.5 million, and an increase in deferred financing costs paid of $4.4 million, offset by net borrowings under our term loans of $182.6 million during 2017 compared to net repayments of $14.7 million in 2016 and an increase in proceeds net of repayments associated with product financing agreements of $52.3 million. Additionally, the disposed retail segment used $17.5 million of cash flows from financing activities associated with debt repayments in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017.\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed cost of materials and other of $1,531.90 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger); \n \u2022 wider discounts between WTI Cushing crude oil compared to Brent and WTI Midland crude oil compared to WTI Cushing which impact refining margin at the Tyler and El Dorado Refineries where, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the average WTI Cushing crude oil differential to Brent crude oil was $6.49 per barrel compared to $3.95 during the year ended December 31, 2017, and the average WTI Midland crude oil differential to WTI Cushing crude oil was $7.36 per barrel compared to $0.34 during the year ended December 31, 2017; \n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \nContribution margin increased by $414.4 million, or a 2.8% improvement in contribution margin percentage, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, provides for immediate deduction of qualified capital assets placed in service, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.At December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Reform Act on our existing deferred tax balances, and recognized a provisional benefit amount of $166.9 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21% for federal purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the analysis of the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act, resulting in our recording of an additional tax benefit of $0.6 million during 2018. These adjustments to the previously recorded provisional amounts include the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and executive compensation.\n\nIn order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligations. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \n \u2022 a 1.5% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, our total cash and cash equivalents were $1,079.3 million and we had total indebtedness of approximately $1,783.3 million. Total unused credit commitments or borrowing base availability, as applicable, under our three separate revolving credit facilities was approximately $913.9 million, and we had letters of credit issued of approximately $179.4 million. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants in all debt facilities as of December 31, 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n2018 vs. 2017\nOther expense (income), net was $(6.1) million and $0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $6.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by the recognition of net periodic benefit cost, exclusive of service costs, associated with our defined benefit pension plans assumed in the Delek/Alon merger.\nNet revenues for the refining segment increased $2,989.8 million, or 45.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 increases in information technology expenses related to system upgrades, security and licensing.  2017 vs. 2016\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). These forward-looking statements reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our planned capital expenditures by segment for 2019, possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will or will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, statements of management's goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

The Krotz Springs refinery has the capability to process substantial volumes of light sweet, crude oils to produce a high percentage of refined light products. \n \u2022 volatility in our refining margins or fuel gross profit as a result of changes in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products; \nOn January 23, 2018, Delek repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock from Alon Israel in connection with Delek's rights pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 14, 2015 by and between Delek and Alon Israel. Alon Israel delivered a right of first offer notice to Delek on January 16, 2018, informing Delek of Alon Israel's intention to sell the 2.0 million shares, and Delek accepted such offer on January 17, 2018. The total purchase price was approximately $75.3 million, or $37.64 per share. In the aggregate, pursuant to various share repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors, we have repurchased 9,022,386 shares for a total of approximately $365.3 million since December 31, 2017. As of February 22, 2019, there is approximately $409.7 million of authorization remaining under Delek's aggregate stock repurchase program (based on repurchases that had settled as of February 22, 2019). See further discussion in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMarch 30, 2018 Delek Revolver and Term Loan\nSubstantially all of the motor fuel sold through our retail segment is supplied by our Big Spring refinery, which is transferred to the retail segment at prices substantially determined by reference to published commodity pricing information.\nDuring January 2019, we also amended the El Dorado refinery and the Krotz Springs refinery Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron so that the repurchase of baseline volumes at the end of the Supply and Offtake Agreement term (representing the Baseline Step-Out Liabilities) will be based upon a fixed price instead of a market-indexed price and therefore subject to changes in fair value that reflect changes in interest rate risk rather than commodity price risk. See further discussion in Note 24 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 higher employee costs, primarily payroll expense, allocated to us as a result of increases in allocated employee headcount and employee incentive costs; \n \u2022 an increase in net average borrowings outstanding (including the obligations under the supply and offtake agreements which have an associated interest charge) of approximately $594.0 million (calculated as a simple average of beginning borrowings/obligations and ending borrowings/obligations for the period) for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, where a significant driver of the increase in borrowings related to the assumption of debt/obligations in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger.  2017 vs. 2016\nThe refining segment processes crude oil and other purchased feedstocks for the manufacture of transportation motor fuels, including various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, asphalt and other petroleum-based products that are distributed through owned and third-party product terminals. It had a combined nameplate capacity of 302,000 barrels per day as of December 31, 2018. Prior to the Delek/Alon Merger, the refining segment operated refineries in Tyler, Texas (the \"Tyler refinery\") and El Dorado, Arkansas (the \"El Dorado refinery\") with a combined design crude throughput (nameplate) capacity of 155,000 barrels per day (\"bpd\"), including the 75,000 bpd Tyler refinery and the 80,000 bpd El Dorado refinery. Effective with the Delek/Alon Merger, our refining segment now also includes a crude oil refinery located in Big Spring, Texas (the \"Big Spring refinery\") with a nameplate capacity of 73,000 bpd, a crude oil refinery located in Krotz Springs, Louisiana (the \"Krotz Springs refinery\") with a nameplate capacity of 74,000 bpd. Our refining segment also included two biodiesel facilities we own and operate that are engaged in the production of biodiesel fuels and related activities, located in Crossett, Arkansas and Cleburne, Texas.\nContribution margin increased by $374.8 million, or a 3.2% improvement in contribution margin percentage, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 the addition of Alon as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed general and administrative expenses of $37.4 during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger), as well as additional absorbed overhead cost, integration costs and related transaction costs incurred during 2017; and \nCost of Materials and Other\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 the recognition of the inventory fair value adjustment associated with purchase accounting as an increase in cost of materials and other during 2017 totaling $33.2 million, as the inventory acquired was sold; and \n (2) Total sales volume includes 1,387, 514, and 102 bpd of produced finished product sold to the Tyler refinery during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 27,048 bpd and 302 of produced finished product sold to the Krotz Springs and Big Spring refineries, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were 140 bpd of produced finished product sold to the logistics segment and 17 bpd sold to the retail segment during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, 406 and 2,247 bpd of produced finished product was sold to Alon Asphalt Company during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total sales volume excludes 47,422, 25,750 and 20,329 bpd of wholesale activity during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed net incremental revenues of $2,710.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months; and \n \u2022 expense associated with the termination of our license agreement with 7-Eleven in 2018.  2017 vs. 2016\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nNet revenues for the refining segment increased $2,697.4 million, or 68.8% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 changes in our ability to continue to access the credit markets; \n \u2022 disruption, failure, or cybersecurity breaches affecting or targeting our IT systems and controls, our infrastructure, or the infrastructure of our cloud-based IT service providers; \n \u2022 the cost of materials and other benefit attributable to the RIN waivers.  2017 vs. 2016\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n(1) Statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a $5.5 million adjustment to increase income tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and to decrease net income and net income attributable to Delek, and reducing basic and diluted income per share by $0.07 and $0.06, respectively, that were not reflected in the Earnings Release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019 (the \"Earnings Release\"). Such adjustment has no impact on adjusted net income or adjusted net income per share (as defined in the Earnings Release). See further discussion in Notes 15 and 23 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 higher costs associated with operating certain of our terminals as a result of volume increases at such terminals; and \nOperating Expenses\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nInterest Expense\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDelek recognizes liabilities which represent the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities, including those that are conditional on a future event, when the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liability's fair value.\n \u2022 additional costs associated with various spills at the El Dorado refinery; \n I. Become nationally recognized for safety and wellness leadership, \n (4) Sales volume includes 19,039 and 728 bpd sold to the El Dorado refinery and 606 and 60 bpd sold to the Tyler refinery during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 higher operating costs at our refineries associated with various spills, maintenance, outages and increased utility expenses; and \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred certain infrequently occurring expenses/charges that were not incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. These included a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the Refinancing and an impairment loss on assets held for sale totaling approximately $27.5 million related to the asphalt assets held for sale. These charges were partially offset by a realized gain on the sale of certain asphalt assets totaling $13.3 million, including a gain on the sale of an asphalt equity method investment. See Notes 8 and 11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, for additional information.\nCost of materials and other for the logistics segment increased $56.2 million, or 15.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the following:\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 higher employee related expenses due to increased headcount, overtime and employee incentive costs; \n \u2022 a $166.9 million benefit attributable to the impact of applying the Tax Reform Act to our existing net deferred tax liabilities in 2017. \n II. Maximize return on assets through best-in-industry reliability and integrity, \n \u2022 an increase in the cost of crude oil feedstocks at the refineries including an increase in the cost of WTI Cushing crude oil from an average of $43.33 per barrel to an average of $50.78, and an increase in the cost of WTI Midland crude oil from an average of $43.25 per barrel to an average of $50.44; \nResults from Equity Method Investments\nA Look to the Future: Our Strategic Goals\n \u2022 decreases in revenues on our Paline Pipeline System. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Paline Pipeline System was FERC regulated pipeline with a tariff established for potential shippers, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, when the pipeline capacity was under contract with two third parties for a monthly fee.  Net revenues included $20.4 million and $16.9 million of net service fees in our east Texas marketing business, paid by our refining segment during 2017 and 2016, respectively. These service fees are based on the number of gallons sold and a shared portion of the margin achieved in return for providing sales and customer support services. Net revenues also include crude, intermediate and refined product transportation, terminalling and storage fees paid by our refining segment. These fees were $129.6 million and $123.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The logistics segment also sold $5.6 million and $6.7 million of RINs, at market prices, to the refining segment during 2017 and 2016, respectively. These intercompany sales and fees are eliminated in consolidation.\n \u2022 increases in the price of U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline, ULSD and HSD, where increases in sales volume at he Tyler, Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries were offset by a decrease in sales volumes at the El Dorado refinery.  2017 vs. 2016\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe California Discontinued Entities were acquired as part of the Delek/Alon Merger and (as discussed in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) consisted primarily of non-operating refineries as well as a small renewables facility. As part of the acquisition, we evaluated the viability of the facilities and their potential for growth and profitability measured against their current operational cost and environmental risk exposure, and a strategic decision was made to divest of these assets. Intensive efforts were made to find suitable buyers with the objective of minimizing both our losses on the sale transactions as well as any on-going environmental exposures (See discussion of environmental exposures in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and, as a result, we successfully closed on the divestitures of all of the California Discontinued Entities during 2018. We believe that the elimination of these Entities provides for the immediate elimination of the financial drain on our operating results while enabling us to divert resources that had previously been charged with managing these assets to more strategic efforts.\n \u2022 an increase in sales volumes in our refining and logistics segments.  Such increases were partially offset by:\nRefining Segment\n \u2022 other factors discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in our other filings with the SEC.  In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, our actual results of operations and execution of our business strategy could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance upon them. In addition, past financial and/or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance, and you should not use our historical performance to anticipate future results or period trends. We can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by any forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them do, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.\n \u2022 employee incentive costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, with no comparable costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.  These increases were partially offset by the following:\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed operating expenses of $172.6 during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger). \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 reliability of our operating assets; \nInterest expense was $93.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $54.4 million for 2016, an increase of $39.4 million, or 72.4%. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 Capitalize on the successful integration of the Alon transaction. During 2017 and 2018 we expended significant efforts to fully integrate the Alon organization. Now that the integration is complete, our goal is to continue to implement best practices to improve the performance of our larger organization which includes focusing on simplifying the organization structure and the balance sheet. We are continuing to realize synergies that are expected to have a positive effect on our combined operations. \n \u2022 increases in cost per gallon of fuel sold to $2.39 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.15 during the six months ended December 31, 2017. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOur results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, including, but not limited to, crude oil, gasoline, distillate fuel, biofuels and natural gas and electricity, among others. Historically, our profitability has been affected by commodity price volatility, specifically as it relates to the price of crude oil and refined products.\nCost of materials and other for the retail segment increased by $405.5 million, or 115.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 increases in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased in our west Texas marketing operations. The average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel increased $0.27 per gallon and $0.31 per gallon, respectively; and \n2018 vs. 2017\nWe generated net revenues of $7,267.1 million and $4,197.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $3,069.2 million, or 73.1%. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the following factors:\nOperating expenses (included in both cost of sales and other operating expenses) were $645.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $429.0 million in 2017, an increase of $216.0 million, or 50.3%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 identifying and managing operational and financial risks to improve operational decision-making and increase profitability.  In addition to the significant initiatives/developments described above, we entered into several other strategic transactions in order to improve our financial position or enhance shareholder value since December 31, 2017, some of the most significant of which are described below.\nSeptember 2018 Settlement of Convertible Debt and Related Call Options\nEnvironmental regulations continue to affect our margins in the form of the increasing RINs cost. On a consolidated basis, we work to balance our RINs obligations in order to minimize the effect of RINs on our results. While we generate RINs in both of our refining and logistics segments through our ethanol blending and biodiesel production, our refining segment needs to purchase additional RINs to satisfy its obligations. As a result, increases in the price of RINs generally adversely affect our results of operations. It is not possible at this time to predict with certainty what future volumes or costs may be, but given the increase in required volumes and the volatile price of RINs, the cost of purchasing sufficient RINs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are unable to recover those costs in the price of our refined products. The chart below illustrates the volatile nature of the price for RINs over the past three years.\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of crude oil feedstocks at the refineries including an increase in the cost of WTI Cushing crude oil from an average of $50.78 per barrel to an average of $65.20, and an increase in the cost of WTI Midland crude oil from an average of $50.44 per barrel to an average of $57.84; and \nThe fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader's understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control.\nCapital Spending\nTransactions designed to maximize return on assets\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger on July 1, 2017; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of refined products in the logistics segment where the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased increased $0.27 per gallon and $0.31 per gallon, respectively; and \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nWe recognized income from equity method investments of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.9 million. This decrease was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 actions of our competitors and customers; \nCash Flows\nWith respect to measuring our refining margins at our refineries, we consider the following:\n \u2022 increases in the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold in our west Texas marketing operations. The average sales prices increased $0.32 per gallon and $0.39 per gallon, respectively; \nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 2-1-1 crack spread (Krotz Springs benchmark) for the past three years, where we have owned the Krotz Springs refinery only since the Delek/Alon Merger.\n \u2022 improvements in our west Texas wholesale marketing margin per barrel as a result of a period of product supply disruptions associated with Hurricane Harvey; and \n V. Positioning for growth. We have a history of achieving growth, largely through acquisitions. Our view for the future includes continuing to identify acquisition targets that are strategic as well as accretive while also exploring the possibility of capital investment opportunities in new technology and alternative energy.  We believe that these strategic objectives and areas of focus are representative of our desire to maximize the opportunities both within and external to the organization in a way that is innovative and forward-thinking, while incorporating some of the strategies that have been essential to our story so far and are part of who we are as a company.\n2018 vs. 2017\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 the absence of an equity method investment in Alon during the last half of 2017, in which we recognized our proportionate share of the net income from our investment in Alon of $4.5 million, net of $1.3 million in amortization of the excess of our investment over our equity in the underlying net assets of Alon, as compared to our proportionate share of the net loss from our investment in Alon of $39.6 million and $2.6 million in amortization of the excess of our investment over our equity in the underlying net assets of Alon for 2016; and \n \u2022 compliance, or failure to comply, with restrictive and financial covenants in our various debt agreements; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities, borrowings under our debt facilities and potential issuances of additional equity and debt securities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our available debt facilities.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\nWe report operating results in three reportable segments: refining, logistics and retail. Decisions concerning the allocation of resources and assessment of operating performance are made based on this segmentation. Management measures the operating performance of each of its reportable segments based on the segment contribution margin.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $175.9 million in 2017, an increase of $71.7 million, or 40.8%. The increase was primarily driven by the following factors:\nInterest expense was $125.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $93.8 million for 2017, an increase of $32.1 million, or 34.2%. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe logistics segment's pipelines and transportation business owns or leases capacity on approximately 400 miles of crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 450 miles of refined product pipelines, an approximately 600-mile crude oil gathering system and associated crude oil storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately 9.6 million barrels of active shell capacity. Our logistics segment owns and operates nine light product terminals and markets light products using third-party terminals.\n2018 vs. 2017\n III. Improve efficiency and execution through development of systems and processes, \nIn our retail segment, we are actively implementing strategic initiatives to reduce our reliance on external brands and to optimize the performance of our portfolio of stores. We are rolling out our own branding initiatives which we will optimize in our current geographic areas as well as emerging markets. As a result of these efforts, we elected to terminate the 7-Eleven licensing agreement (as discussed above) with the current intention to re-brand with our own brand to capitalize on and build our brand recognition in the applicable regions. Additionally, we sold 15 under-performing or non-strategic store locations during the fourth quarter of 2018 and have plans to sell 28 additional stores during the first quarter of 2019. While the proceeds and resultant gains on sale of such related assets were not significant to our financial results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, removing these stores from our portfolio enables us to better focus our retail management and operational efforts on individual store performance, strategic optimization and growth opportunities which may include not only rebranding but possibly also expansion initiatives.\nWe continue to be focused on utilizing our assets to their optimal utility in the framework of our business, and that means strategically aligning our logistics assets with our Delek Logistics business. Such alignment enhances, not only Delek Logistics' growth opportunities, but also our ability to best service the mutually beneficial commercial agreements between Delek Logistics and Delek. This drop-down of logistics assets to Delek Logistics specifically contributes to our ability to provide logistics services to our Big Spring refinery while growing our logistics infrastructure and potential for synergies.\n \u2022 increases in revenue generated under the agreements executed in connection with the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition as described above.  2017 vs. 2016\nThe amount of our capital expenditure budget is subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects and subject to the changes and uncertainties discussed under the 'Forward-Looking Statements' section of Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information, please refer to our discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 a gain on asset disposal of $0.9 million partially driven by the sale of 14 retail stores. \nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread (Big Spring benchmark) for the past three years, where we have owned the Big Spring refinery only since the Delek/Alon Merger.\nOperating Segments\n \u2022 reduction in operating expenses for one of our terminal locations at which we incurred increased costs related to internal tank contamination during the year ended December 31, 2016 that were not incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. \nRefining margin increased by $459.3 million or 73.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, with a refining margin percentage of 11.6% as compared to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily driven by the following:\nRetail Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nIncome tax benefit was $29.2 million and $171.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $142.3 million, reflecting a decrease in our effective tax rate from 43.8% for 2016 to (9.8)% for 2017. The decrease in benefit was primarily driven by the following:\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread (Tyler and El Dorado benchmark) for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nLogistics Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and the Year Ended December 31, 2017 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nIn assessing the recoverability of goodwill, assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. We may consider inputs such as a market participant weighted average cost of capital, estimated growth rates for revenue, gross profit and capital expenditures based on history and our best estimate of future forecasts, all of which are subject to significant judgment and estimates. We may also estimate the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows, such as those used by third-party analysts. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, due to factors such as a decline in general economic conditions, competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond management's control, an impairment charge may be required. A significant risk to our future results and the potential future impairment of goodwill is the volatility of the crude oil and the refined product markets which is often unpredictable and may negatively impact our results of operations in ways that cannot be anticipated and that are beyond management's control.\n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results; and \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 Enhance our position in the Permian Basin. Our 302,000 barrels per day of crude throughput capacity is primarily a WTI-linked crude oil slate that is weighted to supply from the Permian Basin through our access to approximately 200,000 barrels per day. In addition, we have complementary retail and logistics presence in the area. Our strategic focus will be to evaluate options to utilize our position to create additional growth across our businesses, while working toward reducing our susceptibility to volatility in the crude and refined product markets. \nOperating expenses for the retail segment increased by $51.1 million, or 103.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nInformation regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of December 31, 2018, is set forth in the following table (in millions):\nNet Revenues\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(1) Excludes jet fuel and petroleum coke.\nOn September 17, 2018, we exercised the Call Options (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in connection with the settlement of the Convertible Notes and received approximately 2.7 million shares of our common stock from the Call Option counterparties, a cash payment for dividends of approximately $0.3 million and a nominal cash payment in lieu of fractional shares. See further discussion in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 improvements in average sales price of retail fuel per gallon to $2.63 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.34 during the six months ended December 31, 2017, or an increase of 12.5%, where cost per gallon of fuel sold increased to $2.39 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.15 during the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11.2%.  The following chart compares the retail fuel margin results for the year ended December 31, 2018 to six months ended December 31, 2017:\nThe following table provides summary financial data for Delek (in millions):\n\n \u2022 increased fees under our marketing agreement with Delek Holdings as a result of increased throughput due to higher demand following product supply disruptions associated with Hurricane Harvey, partially offset by a decline in fees on our Paline Pipeline System; and \nOperating expenses increased $147.7 million, or 46.5% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:\n2018 vs. 2017\n(3) We have supply agreements to secure certain quantities of crude oil, finished product and other resources used in production at both fixed and market prices. We have estimated future payments under the market based agreements using current market rates. Excludes purchase commitments in buy-sell transactions which have matching notional amounts with the same counterparty and are generally net settled.\nRefining Overview\nOur 2018 Strategic Goals\nNet revenues increased $90.0 million, or 20.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI - Midland crude oil, from an average of $50.44 per barrel for 2017 to an average of $57.84 during 2018. \nSuch increases were partially offset by:\n(3) Consists of terminalling throughputs at our Tyler, Big Spring, Big Sandy and Mount Pleasant, Texas, El Dorado and North Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee terminals. Throughputs for the year ended December 31, 2018 for the Big Spring terminal are for 306 days we operated the terminal following its acquisition effective March 1, 2018. Barrels per day are calculated for only the days we operated each terminal. Total throughput barrels for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 56.6 million barrels, which averaged 155,193 bpd per the period.\nThe Company's overall strategy has been to take a disciplined approach that looks to balance returning cash to our shareholders and prudently investing in the business to support safe and reliable operations, while exploring opportunities for growth. Our goal has been to balance the different aspects of this program based on evaluations of each opportunity and how it matches our strategic goals for the company, while factoring in market conditions and expected cash generation. The following is a summary of our most significant 2018 strategic goals:\nAs was the case for the Convertible Notes and the Call Options, the existing common stock Warrants were also assumed in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. The Warrant agreements provided for the issuance of a certain number of warrants exchangeable for shares of our common stock at a strike price that would have become exercisable beginning in December 2018, and that have been dilutive to our earnings per share calculation during the last three quarters of 2018. By entering into this Unwind Agreement, we were able to limit the upward accretive value of the instrument to its holders and eliminate its dilutive effect, causing an immediate and significant favorable impact on earnings per share.\n \u2022 a $16.0 million reduction of operating expenses attributed to recoveries received from the settlement of disputed indemnification matters related to environmental obligations and asset retirement obligations at the Bakersfield Refinery.  2017 vs. 2016\nNet Revenues\n(2) Amounts reflect future estimated lease payments under operating leases having remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2018.\nBusiness Overview\nCost of materials increased $2,238.1 million, or 61.9% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the following:\n2018 Strategic Developments\n \u2022 pre-tax income of $485.5 million compared to $299.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and an increase in our effective tax rate which was 21.0% compared to (9.8)% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n \u2022 the addition of Alon as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed incremental general and administrative expenses of $31.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months of Alon operating results; \nContribution margin increased by $13.2 million, or 12.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 the addition of Alon property, plant and equipment of $1,130.3 million and the addition of amortizable intangibles of $61.3 million as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, combined with the addition of other capital expenditures and acquisitions (net of disposals) completed to date, where such additions contributed $45.3 million in incremental depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018, which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months of Alon operating results.  2017 vs. 2016\n \u2022 a 41.6% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread; and \nOur logistics segment gathers, transports and stores crude oil and markets, distributes, transports and stores refined products in select regions of the southeastern United States and west Texas for our refining segment and third parties. It is comprised of the consolidated balance sheet and results of operations of Delek Logistics Partners, LP (\"Delek Logistics\", NYSE:DKL), where we owned a 61.4% limited partner interest (at December 31, 2018) in Delek Logistics and a 94.6% interest in the entity that owns the entire 2.0% general partner interest in Delek Logistics and all of the incentive distribution rights. Delek Logistics was formed by Delek in 2012 to own, operate, acquire and construct crude oil and refined products logistics and marketing assets. A substantial majority of Delek Logistics' assets are currently integral to our refining and marketing operations.\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 Grow our logistics operations. The combination of our access to the Permian Basin and larger refining operation should allow us to continue to grow our logistics footprint. We will look for opportunities to capitalize on this position to increase our crude gathering operations, support the refining system and third party customers. This includes exploring opportunities for continued development through joint ventures and opportunities to acquire assets in markets that are complementary to our existing geographic footprint. \nRetail Overview\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed net incremental cost of materials and other of $2,159.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months of Alon operating results; \nNet cash provided by investing activities was $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $200.7 million in 2016. This decrease in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment, which increased from $46.3 million in 2016 to $172.0 million in 2017. Additionally, the disposed retail segment provided $288.9 million of cash flows from investing activities in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017, while the California Discontinued Entities provided $12.2 million of cash flows from investing activities in 2017. This decrease was partially offset by the the cash acquired in the Delek/Alon Merger of $200.5 million (excluding the cash acquired attributable to the California Discontinued Entities) and a decrease in equity method contributions of $55.8 million.\n\n \u2022 higher operating costs in our logistics segment associated with increased volumes at our terminals and maintenance costs.  Such increases were partially offset by:\n \u2022 operating hazards, natural disasters, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control; \n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger on July 1, 2017; \n \u2022 For our Tyler refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread. The Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread is used as a benchmark for measuring a refinery's product margins by measuring the difference between the market price of light products and crude oil, and represents the approximate refined product margin resulting from processing one barrel of crude oil into three-fifths barrel of gasoline and two-fifths barrel of high-sulfur diesel. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nNet revenues for the retail segment increased by $488.7 million, or 114.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n(1) Expected interest payments on debt outstanding at December 31, 2018. Floating interest rate debt is calculated using December 31, 2018 rates. For additional information, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\n \u2022 addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n (3) Total sales volume includes 13,967 and 15,190 bpd sold to the retail segment, 10,005 and 176 bpd sold to the logistics segment and 1,688 and 1,510 bpd sold to Alon Asphalt Company during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nExecutive Summary and Strategic Overview\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 acts of terrorism (including cyber-terrorism) aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; \n \u2022 increase in other miscellaneous income, including decrease in reserves related to pending litigation and the relieving of certain retail deposits.  Such increases were partially offset by:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nIt is our policy to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities represent the current estimated costs to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties. This estimate is based on internal and third-party assessments of the extent of the contamination, the selected remediation technology and review of applicable environmental regulations, typically considering estimated activities and costs for 15 years, and up to 30 years if a longer period is believed reasonably necessary. Accruals for estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and include, but are not limited to, costs to perform remedial actions and costs of machinery and equipment that are dedicated to the remedial actions and that do not have an alternative use. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. We discount environmental liabilities to their present value if payments are fixed and determinable. Expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized.\nWe believe the accounting estimate related to the establishment of anticipated year-end LIFO inventory is a critical accounting estimate, because it requires management to make assumptions about future production rates in the Tyler refinery, the future buying patterns of our customers, as well as numerous other factors beyond our control, including the economic viability of the general economy, weather conditions, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. The impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates could be material to the inventories reported on our quarterly balance sheets, and the impact on the results reported in our quarterly statements of income could be material. In selecting assumed inventory levels, we use historical trending of production and sales, recognition of current market indicators of future pricing and value and new regulatory requirements which might impact inventory levels. Management's assumptions require significant judgment because actual year-end inventory levels have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so.\nOther operating (income) expense, net was $(31.3) million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $(32.3) million. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 general economic and business conditions affecting the southern, southwestern and western United States, particularly levels of spending related to travel and tourism; \nOur profitability in the refining segment is substantially determined by the difference between the cost of the crude oil feedstocks we purchase and the price of the refined products we sell, referred to as the \"crack spread\", \"refining margin\" or \"refined product margin\". The cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined petroleum products we ultimately sell from our refineries depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes, local, domestic and foreign political affairs, global conflict, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. Other significant factors that influence our results in the refining segment include operating costs (particularly the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity), seasonal factors, refinery utilization rates and planned or unplanned maintenance activities or turnarounds. Moreover, while the fluctuations in the cost of crude oil are typically reflected in the prices of light refined products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, the price of other residual products, such as asphalt, coke, carbon black oil and LPG are less likely to move in parallel with crude cost. This could cause additional pressure on our realized margin during periods of rising or falling crude oil prices. Additionally, our margins are impacted by the pricing differentials of the various types and sources of crude oil we use at our refineries and their relation to product pricing, such as the differentials between WTI Midland and WTI Cushing or WTI Midland and Brent crude oil.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n2018 and 2019 Share Repurchases\n2018 vs. 2017\nLIFO Inventory\n \u2022 improved contribution margin in our west Texas operations as a result of increased drilling activity in the region, which has improved market conditions and increased demand; \n \u2022 reduction in RINs expense, primarily associated with the $47.5 million reduction in RINs expense associated with the RINs waiver received by the El Dorado refinery in the first quarter of 2017.  These increases were partially offset by the following:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $560.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $319.7 million for the comparable period of 2017. The increase in cash flows from operations was partially due to an increase in net income, which for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $374.9 million, compared to $322.6 million in the same period of 2017. A decrease in cash used to purchase inventory and other current assets and increase in cash received on accounts receivable also contributed to the increase in cash flows from operations. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2017, net income included a non-cash gain on remeasurement of equity method investment of $190.1 million for which there was no comparable activity in the current period. This increase was partially offset by increases in cash used to pay accounts payable and other current liabilities and obligation under the supply and offtake agreement with J. Aron. Additionally partially offsetting the increase, net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a non-cash benefit of deferred income taxes of $26.8 million compared to expense of $48.0 million in the prior year.\nWe recognized income from equity method investments of $12.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to loss of $43.4 million for 2016. Changes in the results from equity method investments for 2017 and 2016 were primarily driven by the following:\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average prices of WTI Midland crude oil for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present, we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset, undiscounted and without interest charges. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. We use quoted market prices when available and our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount, an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset. We recognized an impairment charge of $2.7 million in 2016 related to the write-down of certain idle refining equipment in our refining segment to net realizable value. This impairment charge is included in other operating income in our consolidated statement of income for the period. There were no such impairment charges in 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 the cost of materials and other benefit attributable to the RIN waivers. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOther Operating (Income) Expense, Net\nNet Revenues\nCost of Materials and Other\n2017 vs. 2016\nMarch 2018 RINs Waivers\n IV. Identify and manage risks to improve decision making and increase profitability, and \n \u2022 the absence of the equity method investment in Alon during the year ended December 31, 2018 whereas we recognized our proportionate share of the net income from our investment in Alon of $4.5 million, net of $1.3 million in amortization of the excess of our investment over our equity in the underlying net assets of Alon, for the year ended December 31, 2017; and \n \u2022 growing our business through new lines of business and investment in our existing businesses including capital improvements and new technology, and \nDepreciation and amortization (included in both cost of sales and other operating expenses) was $199.4 million and $153.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $46.1 million, or 30.1%. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 the effects of increases in the price of finished petroleum products at our refineries (including a 18.0% increase in average price of CBOB gasoline per gallon and a 26.3% increase in average price of ULSD per gallon).  2017 vs. 2016\nRefining margin increased by $562.1 million or 73.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, with a refining margin percentage of 13.8% as compared to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAll forward-looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n \u2022 For our Big Spring refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread. The Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread is calculated assuming that one barrel of WTI Cushing crude oil are converted into two-thirds barrel of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one-third barrel of Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel. Our Big Spring refinery is capable of processing substantial volumes of sour crude oil, which has historically cost less than intermediate, and/or substantial volumes of sweet crude oils, and therefore the WTI Cushing/WTS price differential, taking into account differences in production yield, is an important measure for helping us make strategic, market-respondent production decisions. \nOther operating expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, primarily related to losses on asset disposals.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 increases in our debt levels or costs; \n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed net sales of $1,906.4 during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger); \nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\nFebruary 2018 Acquisition of Non-controlling Interest in Alon Partnership\n \u2022 an increase to our effective tax rate to a more normalized level (in relation to statutory tax rates) where the 2017 tax rate was favorably and significantly impacted by the $166.9 million benefit attributable to the impact of applying the Tax Reform Act to our existing net deferred tax liabilities in 2017.  2017 vs. 2016\nForward-Looking Statements\n \u2022 higher operating costs associated with the logistics assets acquired in the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition, including maintenance expenses, allocated employee costs, variable expenses such as utilities, and professional services fees incurred in connection with the transaction, which accounted for the majority of the increase in operating increases; \nGoodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as disruptions in our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results or a sustained market capitalization decline. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value (Step 1), the impairment assessment leads to the testing of the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount (Step 2). If the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2017-04 (which we adopted during the fourth quarter of 2018, as permitted by the ASU), Step 2 is no longer required, but rather any impairment is determined based on the results of Step 1.\nOur refining segment has multiple service agreements with our logistics segment, which, among other things, require the refining segment to pay terminalling and storage fees based on the throughput volume of crude and finished product in the logistics segment pipelines and the volume of crude and finished product stored in the logistics segment storage tanks, subject to certain minimum volume commitments. These fees were $200.4 million, $129.6 million and $123.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We eliminate these intercompany fees in consolidation.\n \u2022 seasonality; \nOur corporate activities, results of certain immaterial operating segments (including our asphalt terminal operations effective with the Delek/ Alon Merger), our non-controlling equity interest of approximately 47% of the outstanding shares in Alon (which was accounted for as an equity method investment) prior to the Delek/Alon Merger, results and assets of discontinued operations and intercompany eliminations are reported in the corporate, other and eliminations segment.\n(2) Throughputs for the year ended December 31, 2018 are for the 306 days we marketed certain finished products produced at or sold from the Big Spring Refinery following execution of the Big Spring Marketing Agreement, effective March 1, 2018, as defined in Note 6 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 addition of Alon property, plant and equipment of $1,130.5 million (at preliminary fair value) and amortizable intangibles of $53.6 million (at preliminary fair value) as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed $34.4 million in additional depreciation and amortization during 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger). \n \u2022 improvements in crude oil differentials as described above; and \nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 changes in interpretations, assumptions and expectations regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including additional guidance that may be issued by federal and state taxing authorities; \nOther Non-Operating Expenses, Net\nOur annual assessment of goodwill did not result in impairment during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $101.9 million and $(29.2) million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase in expense of $131.1 million. The increase in expense was primarily driven by the following:\nThe Refinancing consolidated many of our facilities providing not only a more simplified borrowing structure but also expanding our borrowing capacity with interest rates that reflect our strengthened financial position and broadened asset base. Additionally, our covenant requirements under the Refinancing arrangements are less complex and therefore better allow us to manage our covenant compliance risk.\nThe market price of refined products contributed to the increase in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread to $13.21 in 2018 from $13.01 in 2017, with the Gulf Coast price of gasoline (CBOB) increasing 18.0%, from an average of $1.55 per gallon in 2017 to $1.83 per gallon in 2018. The Gulf Coast price of High Sulfur Diesel increased 30.8%, from an average of $1.47 per gallon in 2017 to $1.92 per gallon in 2018. The Gulf Coast price of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel increased 26.3% from an average of $1.62 per gallon in 2017 to $2.05 per gallon in 2018. The charts below illustrate the quarterly high, low and average prices of Gulf Coast Gasoline, U.S. High Sulfur Diesel and U.S. Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel over the past three years.\nThe cost to acquire the refined fuel products we sell to our wholesale customers in our logistics segment and at our convenience stores in our retail segment depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. Our retail merchandise sales are driven by convenience, customer service, competitive pricing and branding. Motor fuel margin is sales less the delivered cost of fuel and motor fuel taxes, measured on a cents per gallon basis. Our motor fuel margins are impacted by local supply, demand, weather, competitor pricing and product brand.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe improvement in contribution margin percentage is also attributable to increased efficiencies and optimization of store operations during the period since the stores were acquired.\nCost of materials and other increased $2,427.7 million, or 41.5% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the following:\n V. Significantly increase overall earnings.  These overarching objectives are supported by five strategic focuses, which inform the priorities of each segment's initiatives, as discussed below:\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by the following:\nResults of Operations\nDisclosures, Financial Statements, and Changes in Disagreements\n2017 vs. 2016\n2018 vs. 2017\nSummary Financial and Other Information\n2018 Disposal of California Discontinued Entities\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our credit facilities.\n \u2022 Optimization of our refining system. We have doubled the size of our refining system since 2016. This gives us the opportunities to utilize the best practices from each location to improve reliability, efficiencies and yields in an effort to maximize performance. This should enhance our competitive position and free cash flow potential. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 Maintain and continue to enhance our safe operations. As we invest in and grow our business, we remain focused on safe and compliant operations for the benefit of our employees, communities, customers and shareholders. \n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results; and \n\nDuring 2018, Delek's leadership team built a new framework to facilitate development of the Company's strategies and initiatives. This framework starts with the Company's overarching objectives for the next five years:\nLogistics Segment\nOperating Expenses\nWe consistently seek out regulatory and operational opportunities to minimize costs and thereby maximize the return on our refining assets. In March 2018, the El Dorado and Krotz Springs refineries both received approval from the EPA for a small refinery exemption from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the 2017 calendar year, which resulted in a reduction of our RINs Obligation (as defined in Note 13 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and related cost of materials and other of approximately $59.3 million and $31.6 million for the El Dorado and Krotz Springs refineries, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n2018 vs. 2017\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 a net increase of 8.0 million gallons in the volume of gasoline and diesel purchased in west Texas during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to gallons purchased during the year ended December 31, 2016. \nThe Retail Segment was not reported for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for periods in 2017 prior to July 1, 2017 (the date of the Delek/Alon Merger), as our previous Retail Entities were discontinued, and the new Retail Segment was not acquired until July 1, 2017. The table below sets forth certain information concerning our retail segment operations ($ in millions):\nThe transaction to dispose of certain assets and liabilities associated with our Long Beach, California refinery to Bridge Point Long Beach, LLC, closed July 17, 2018 resulting in initial cash proceeds of approximately $14.5 million, net of expenses. See further discussion in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (5) For our Tyler and El Dorado refineries, we compare our per barrel refining product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread consisting of WTI Cushing crude, U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB and U.S, Gulf Coast Pipeline No. 2 heating oil (high sulfur diesel). For our Big Spring refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread consisting of WTI Cushing crude, Gulf Coast 87 Conventional gasoline and Gulf Coast ultra low sulfur diesel, and for our Krotz Springs refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 2-1-1 crack spread consisting of LLS crude oil, Gulf Coast 87 Conventional gasoline and U.S, Gulf Coast Pipeline No. 2 heating oil (high sulfur diesel). The Tyler refinery's crude oil input is primarily WTI Midland and east Texas, while the El Dorado refinery's crude input is primarily combination of WTI Midland, local Arkansas and other domestic inland crude oil. The Big Spring refinery's crude oil input is primarily comprised of WTS and WTI Midland. The Krotz Springs refinery's crude oil input is primarily comprised of LLS and WTI Midland. The Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries were acquired July 1, 2017 as part of the Delek/Alon Merger, so Gulf Coast 3-2-1 and 2-1-1 crack spreads, LLS and WTS statistics are presented only for the period Delek owned these refineries. \n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results; and \nContribution Margin\n \u2022 The crude oil and product slate flexibility of the El Dorado refinery allows us to take advantage of changes in the crude oil and product markets; therefore, we anticipate that the quantities and varieties of crude oil processed and products manufactured at the El Dorado refinery by processing a variety of feedstocks into a number of refined product types will continue to vary. While there is variability in the crude slate and the product output at the El Dorado refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread because we believe it to be the most closely aligned benchmark.  A widening of the WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread will favorably influence the operating margin for our refineries. Alternatively, a narrowing of this differential will have an adverse effect on our operating margins. Global product prices are influenced by the price of Brent crude which is a global benchmark crude. Global product prices influence product prices in the U.S. As a result, our refineries are influenced by the spread between Brent crude and WTI Midland. The Brent less WTI Midland spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of WTI Cushing crude oil. A widening of the spread between Brent and WTI Cushing will favorably influence our refineries' operating margins. Also, the Krotz Springs refinery is influenced by the spread between Brent crude and LLS. The Brent less LLS spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of LLS crude oil. A discount in LLS relative to Brent will favorably influence the Krotz Springs refinery operating margin.\nOperating expenses increased $105.3 million, or 49.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \n \u2022 a reduction in cost of materials and other attributable to RIN waiver received which resulted in an incremental net reduction of such costs as compared to the prior year. \nConsolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $374.9 million compared to $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Consolidated net income attributable to Delek for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $340.1 million, or $4.11 per basic share, compared to $288.8 million, or $4.04 per basic share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Explanations for significant drivers impacting net income as compared to the comparable period of the prior year are discussed in the sections below.\n IV. Risk-based decision making. Making effective and insightful decisions in a rapidly changing environment is a hallmark of high-performing organizations that sustain through volatile times. We are working to develop mitigation plans for defined operational and business unit risks that will be anticipatory and preemptive. \nEffective December 21, 2018, we amended our Big Spring refinery's Supply and Offtake Agreement with J. Aron so that the repurchase of baseline volumes at the end of the Supply and Offtake Agreement term (representing the \"Baseline Step-Out Liability\") will be based upon a fixed price instead of a market-indexed price. The modified arrangement results in a Baseline Step-Out Liability that is no longer subject to commodity volatility, but for which its fair value is subject to interest rate risk. As a result, we recorded a gain on the change in fair value resulting from the modification of the instruments from commodities-based risk to interest rate risk in cost of materials and other totaling approximately $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Baseline Step-Out Liability under the Big Spring refinery's Supply and Offtake Agreement represents the fixed notional amount outstanding under the Supply and Offtake Agreement of $52.0 million less the unamortized discount of $2.4 million for a fair value of $49.6 million related to 0.8 million barrels of baseline consigned inventory, and is reflected as a non-current obligation on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Such Baseline Step-Out Liabilities will continue to be recorded at fair value, where the fair value will reflect changes in interest rate risk rather than commodity price risk. See further discussion in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average prices of WTI Cushing crude oil for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nDepreciation and amortization was $153.3 million and $116.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $36.9 million, or 31.7%. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 our ability to execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions and capital projects and changes in the expected value of and benefits derived therefrom, including any inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, realize expected synergies or achieve operational efficiency and effectiveness; \nAccounting Standards\n \u2022 business interruption insurance proceeds of $42.4 million associated with a settlement of litigation received in the first quarter of 2016. \n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger on July 1, 2017; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThese significant developments were intentionally implemented to align with some of our most critical strategic initiatives for both 2018 and 2019 which include managing our risk and enhancing shareholder value by focusing on the following:\nIn November 2018, Delek entered into Warrant Unwind Agreements (the \"Unwind Agreement\") with the holders of our outstanding common stock Warrants (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Pursuant to the terms of the Unwind Agreements, we settled for cash all outstanding Warrants with the holders at various prices per Warrant as provided in the Unwind Agreements. The settlement amount was based on the volume-weighted average market price of our common stock taking into account an adjustment for the exercise price of the Warrants over a period of sixteen trading days beginning November 9, 2018 (the Unwind Period\u201d). Following the Unwind Period and upon the satisfaction of the payment obligation, the Warrants were canceled and the associated rights and obligations terminated. Based on the provisions of the Unwind Agreement, the amount paid to warrant holders in satisfaction of the payment obligation totaled approximately $36 million. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nService Agreements\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n2018 vs. 2017\nDecember 31, 2021 or the date upon which our last 7-Eleven store is de-identified or closed. Merchandise sales at our convenience store sites will continue to be sold under the 7-Eleven brand name until 7-Eleven branding is removed pursuant to the termination.\n(3) Statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects six months of incremental results of operations resulting from the Delek/Alon Merger, which was effective July 1, 2017. Additionally, the balance sheet date as of December 31, 2017 reflects the assets and liabilities of Alon as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger.\n \u2022 the recognition of our proportionate share of net income for equity method investments acquired in the Delek/Alon Merger. \n \u2022 Build on a winning culture. During 2017 and 2018, we believe our team responded well to our larger scale, as steps were taken to integrate the two companies following the acquisition of Alon in July 2017. We are now a larger and more diverse company, but our focus is to foster a culture that has the ability to act quickly in a changing environment to take advantage of opportunities. In order to support this operation, we continue to be focused on expanding our team, developing systems and providing the resources to position the organization for success in the future. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOn May 21, 2018, we sold certain assets and operations of four asphalt terminals (included in Delek's corporate/other segment), as well as an equity method investment in an additional asphalt terminal, to an affiliate of Andeavor. This transaction includes asphalt terminal assets in Bakersfield, Mojave and Elk Grove, California and Phoenix, Arizona, as well as Delek's 50% equity interest in the Paramount-Nevada Asphalt Company, LLC joint venture that operates an asphalt terminal located in Fernley, Nevada. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $110.8 million, inclusive of the $75.0 million base proceeds as well as certain preliminary working capital adjustments. The assets associated with the owned terminals met the definition of held for sale pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (\"ASC 360\") as of February 1, 2018, but did not meet the definition of discontinued operations pursuant to ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations (\"ASC 205-20\") as the sale of these asphalt assets does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. Accordingly, depreciation ceased as of February 1, 2018, and the associated assets to be sold were reclassified to assets held for sale as of that date and were written down to the estimated fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment loss on assets held for sale of $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In connection with the completion of the sale transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $13.3 million in results of continuing operations on the accompanying consolidated income statement. See further discussion in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 a 41.6% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread in 2017 as compared to 2016, which favorably impacted the period-over- period margins at all refineries; and \n \u2022 increases in the price of U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline, ULSD and HSD. \nof the volatility of the market in terms of pricing and availability, it is possible that we may have material positions with timing differences or, more rarely, that we are unable to cover a position with an offsetting position as intended. Such differences could have a material impact on the classification of resulting gains/losses, assets or liabilities, and could also significantly impact net earnings.\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe Tyler refinery's inventory consists of crude oil, refined petroleum products and blendstocks which are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the last-in, first-out LIFO valuation method. The LIFO method requires management to make estimates on an interim basis of the anticipated year-end inventory quantities, which could differ from actual quantities.\nChanges in laws and regulations and actual remediation expenses compared to historical experience could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.\nMarch 2018 Transaction with Delek Logistics\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 volatility under our derivative instruments; \n2018 vs. 2017\nWe generated net revenues of $10,233.1 million and $7,267.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2,966.0 million, or 40.8%. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the following factors:\nOn March 16, 2018, Delek sold to World Energy, LLC (i) all of Delek's membership interests in AltAir (ii) certain refining assets and other related assets located in Paramount, California and (iii) certain associated tank farm and pipeline assets and other related assets located in California. Upon final settlement, Delek expects to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $85.2 million, subject to a post-closing working capital settlement, Delek's portion of the expected biodiesel tax credit for 2017 and certain customary adjustments. The sale resulted in a loss on sale of discontinued operations totaling approximately $41.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Of the total expected proceeds, $70.4 million was received in March 2018 ($14.9 million of which were included in net cash flows from investing activities in discontinued operations), with the remainder expected to be collected upon final settlement. In connection with the sale, the remaining assets and liabilities associated with the sold operations that were not included in the assets and liabilities acquired/assumed by the buyer were reclassified into assets and liabilities held and used (relating to continuing operations) and are presented as such in our December 31, 2018 balance sheet.\n(2) Statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a $60.7 adjustment to increase net revenues and cost of materials and other to record a correction of an intercompany elimination that was not reflected in the February 20, 2019 Earnings Release. Such amounts are not considered material to the financial statements and had no impact to operating income, segment contribution margin or net income.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 changes in, or the failure to comply with, the extensive government regulations applicable to our industry segments; \nto owned interest was recorded at carrying value and no gain or loss was recognized in connection with the transaction. See further discussion in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "item_7_text": "YTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nWe have executed on many initiatives during 2018 that have significantly advanced our progress toward the realization of our 2018 strategic goals. As part of a larger initiative to reduce our susceptibility to volatility in crack spreads, we continued to build on our Permian Basin platform in 2018. For example, Since December 31, 2017, we have focused efforts on developing a 200-mile gathering system in the Permian Basin connecting to our Big Spring, Texas terminal. This gathering system will provide Delek with access to crude directly from wellheads which will provide improvement in refining performance and cost structure while also providing a foundation for building a new midstream income source. As of December 31, 2018, approximately 50 miles of the gathering system were completed and operational. Additionally, in September 2018, Delek announced plans for a joint venture with Energy Transfer, Magellan, and MPLX to construct a 600-mile common carrier pipeline to transport crude oil from the Permian Basin to the Texas Gulf Coast region. We continue to work with our prospective partners to evaluate potential options for the development of the long-haul pipeline, including the possible combination of our project with another announced project. These developments position us to continue growing our midstream business and increase our fee-based income in that space, which will reduce our exposure to the volatility of the crude and refined product markets.\nTransactions designed to minimize the cost of capital/manage financial risk exposures\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nNet cash used in investing activities was $125.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to net cash provided of $37.6 million in the comparable period of 2017. The decrease in cash flows provided by investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment, which increased from $172.0 million in 2017, to $322.0 million in 2018, and a $11.2 million decrease in distributions received from equity method investments. Additionally, $200.5 million in cash (excluding the cash acquired attributable to the California Discontinued Entities) was acquired in 2017 with the Delek/Alon Merger. This decrease was partially offset by proceeds from sales of discontinued operations of $55.5 million and proceeds from the sale of asphalt assets of $110.8 million received in 2018.\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of refined products in the logistics segment where the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased increased $0.23 per gallon and $0.45 per gallon, respectively. \n \u2022 $47.5 million reduction in RINs expense associated with the RINs waiver received by the El Dorado refinery in the first quarter of 2017. \n \u2022 higher maintenance costs associated with certain of our tanks at our tank farms; and \nThe table below sets forth certain information concerning our logistics segment operations ($ in millions, except per barrel amounts):\nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\n \u2022 the recognition of a gain related to settlement of disputed indemnification matters related to environmental obligations and asset retirement obligations at the Bakersfield Refinery; and \nCost of materials and other increased by $70.7 million, or 23.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the following:\nTransactions designed to maximize shareholder return\nCost of Materials and Other\n \u2022 increases in the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold in our west Texas marketing operations. The average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold increased $0.29 per gallon and $0.45 per gallon, respectively, amounting to an increase of $78.7 million of the $119.5 million increase in net revenues; and \n \u2022 acquired assets may suffer a diminishment in fair value, which may require us to record a write-down or impairment; \nInsurance proceeds - business interruption\n \u2022 the inability of our subsidiaries to freely make dividends, loans or other cash distributions to us; \nConsolidated Results of Operations - Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and the Year Ended December 31, 2017 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2016\n \u2022 increases in the weighted average interest rate, including LIBOR interest rates, under our credit facilities \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 an increase of $20.1 million related to realized and unrealized gains on trading forward contract derivatives and net of gains of $7.7 million on related hedging derivatives in 2018; and \n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed incremental operating expenses of $160.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months of Alon operating results; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 a reduction of our RINs Obligation and related cost of materials and other of approximately $59.3 million and $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, related to the receipt of small refinery exemptions from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard at our El Dorado refinery for the 2018 and 2017 calendar years, respectively. In March 2018, the Krotz Springs refinery received such approval as well, which resulted in a reduction of our RINs Obligation and related cost of materials and other of approximately $31.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  2017 vs. 2016\nContribution margin increased by $47.9 million, or 39.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI- Cushing crude oil from an average of $43.33 per barrel for 2016 to an average of $50.78 during 2017,; and \n \u2022 Use our financial flexibility and cash flow to create shareholder value. We are focused on managing the cash flow in our business to support our capital allocation program that includes: 1) returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, 2) investing in our business and 3) growing through acquisitions - all of which combine to serve our central goal of increasing long-term value for our shareholders. \nIn the refining segment, we have asset retirement obligations with respect to our refineries due to various legal obligations to clean and/or dispose of these assets at the time they are retired. However, the majority of these assets can be used for extended and indeterminate periods of time provided that they are properly maintained and/or upgraded. It is our practice and intent to continue to maintain these assets and make improvements based on technological advances. In the logistics segment, these obligations relate to the required cleanout of the pipeline and terminal tanks and removal of certain above-grade portions of the pipeline situated on right-of-way property. In the retail segment, we have asset retirement obligations related to the removal of underground storage tanks and the removal of brand signage at owned and leased retail sites which are legally required under the applicable leases. The asset retirement obligation for storage tank removal on leased retail sites is accreted over the expected life of the owned retail site or the average retail site lease term.\n \u2022 addition of assumed debt totaling $568.0 million (at fair value) in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger; and \n \u2022 deterioration of creditworthiness or overall financial condition of a material counterparty (or counterparties); \nCash Position and Indebtedness\nThe acquisition of the non-controlling interest in the Alon Partnership enabled us to refocus the efforts being expended for that separate master limited partnership on a more synergistic and cohesive strategy where both the tactical operational and growth objectives of the Big Spring refinery (owned by the Alon Partnership) are fully integrated and aligned within our refining segment. Additionally, the elimination of the non-controlling public ownership allows us to channel 100% of the Alon Partnership's operational, market and financial contributions to the benefit of Delek and its shareholders.\n \u2022 a 1.5% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread; \n \u2022 the cost of materials and other benefit attributable to the RIN waivers.  2017 vs. 2016\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated cash flows (in millions):\nCorporate and Other Overview\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nContribution margin for the retail segment increased by $32.1 million, a 119.8% improvement in contribution margin percentage, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nRetail Segment\nAdditionally, other expense (income), net was $(7.3) million and $(6.1) million in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $1.2 million.

Systems and processes. A primary focus to achieve not only an efficient model for sustainability but also to position us to absorb anticipated growth is to develop next generation processes and systems that are integrated, organized, and that are aligned with our operational and strategic objectives. \nLogistics Overview\nRefining Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and the Year Ended December 31, 2017 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nYTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nMarket Trends\nOn March 30, 2018, (the \"Closing Date\"), Delek entered into (i) a new term loan credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Term Administrative Agent\"), Delek, as borrower, and the lenders from time to time party thereto, providing for a senior secured term loan facility in an amount of $700.0 million (the \"Term Loan Credit Facility\") and (ii) a second amended and restated credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent (the \"Revolver Administrative Agent\"), Delek, as borrower, certain subsidiaries of Delek, as guarantors, and the other lenders party thereto, providing for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility with commitments of $1.0 billion (the \"Revolving Credit Facility\" and, together with the \"Term Loan Credit Facility,\" the \"New Credit Facilities\") - see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Financial Statements, for additional information. The Term Loan Credit Facility was drawn in full for $700.0 million on the Closing Date at an original issue discount of 0.50%. Proceeds under the Term Loan Credit Facility, as well as proceeds of approximately $300.0 million in borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility on the Closing Date, were used to repay certain indebtedness of Delek and its subsidiaries (the Refinancing\u201d), as well as certain fees, costs and expenses in connection with the closing of the New Credit Facilities, with any remaining proceeds held in cash. Proceeds of future borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes of Delek and its subsidiaries. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt totaling approximately $9.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 in connection with the Refinancing. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 a net increase of 8.0 million gallons in the volume of gasoline and diesel sold in west Texas during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to gallons sold during the year ended December 31, 2016; \n \u2022 net revenues generated under the agreements executed in connection with the Big Spring Logistics Assets Acquisition, which were effective March 1, 2018.

We still intend to focus on long-term shareholder returns; to have significant organic growth by identifying and capitalizing on margin improvement opportunities; to maintain financial flexibility to achieve the operational, capital and transactional objectives that are important to our sustainability and long-term growth; to continue to grow and develop complementary logistics systems; and to focus efforts on our Permian refining system, all of which contribute to thriving as an integrated and diversified refining, logistics and marketing company.\n(4) Balances consist of contractual obligations under agreements with third parties (not including Delek Logistics) for the transportation of crude oil to our refineries.\n \u2022 risks and uncertainties with respect to the quantities and costs of refined petroleum products supplied to our pipelines and/or held in our terminals; \nNet cash provided by financing activities was $297.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to cash used of $104.6 million in the comparable 2017 period. We completed the Refinancing transaction as well as extinguished the Convertible Notes during the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in net cash flows from financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from long-term revolvers of $2,124.6 million and proceeds from term debt of $690.6 million, offset by payments on long-term revolvers of $1,679.8 million, payment on term debt of $826.3 million, deferred financing costs paid of $13.8 million, repayment of product financing agreements of $72.4 million, repurchase of common stock of $365.3 million and increases in dividends paid to $80.1 million compared to $44.0 million in the comparable 2017 period.\nNet revenues increased by $119.5 million, or 22.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily driven by the following:\nWe recognized proceeds from business interruption insurance claims of $42.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, associated with a litigation settlement. We did not record any insurance proceeds for the years ended December 31, 2018 or 2017.\n2018 vs. 2017\n II. Reliability and integrity. We are focused on improving refinery system availability through top-tiered maintenance and equipment monitoring, and minimizing environmental releases by exploring new technologies and methods for monitoring and correcting failures before they result in releases. But this objective reaches beyond our refining and logistics operations. We are also committed to improving the reliability and integrity of our internal information and organizational infrastructure, with a specific emphasis on information technology as well as other functions that support the operating business units. \n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI - Midland crude oil, from an average of $43.25 per barrel for 2016 to an average of $50.44 during 2017.

These increases were partially offset by the following:\nGoodwill and Potential Impairment\nMay 2018 Sale of Asphalt Assets\nOn September 17, 2018, Delek settled its Convertible Notes (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for a combination of cash and shares of New Delek Common Stock. The maturity settlement in respect of the Convertible Notes consisted of (i) cash payments totaling approximately $152.5 million which included a cash payment for outstanding principal of $150.0 million, a cash payment for accrued interest of approximately $2.2 million, a cash payment for dividends of approximately $0.3 million and a nominal cash payment in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) the issuance of approximately 2.7 million shares of New Delek Common Stock to holders of the Convertible Notes (the Conversion Shares\u201d). The issuance of the Conversion Shares was made in exchange for the Convertible Notes pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAs part of our overall business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our portfolio of businesses and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that, if consummated, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\n \u2022 a decline in fees on our Paline Pipeline System as described above. \n \u2022 addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017. \nGeneral and administrative expenses were $175.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to $106.1 million in 2016, an increase of $69.8 million, or 65.8%. The overall increase was primarily driven by the following factors:\n2018 vs. 2017\n2018 vs. 2017\nIn addition to the above, it continues to be a strategic and operational objective to manage price and supply risk related to crude oil that is used in refinery production, and to develop strategic sourcing relationships. For that purpose, from a pricing perspective, we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions, future purchases of crude oil and ethanol, future sales of refined products or to fix margins on future production. We also enter into future commitments to purchase or sell RINs at fixed prices and quantities, which are used to manage the costs associated with our RINs obligations. Additionally, from a sourcing perspective, we often enter into purchase and sale contracts with vendors and customers or take financial commodity positions for crude oil that may not be used immediately in production, but that may be used to manage the overall supply and availability of crude expected to ultimately be needed for production and/or to meet minimum requirements under strategic pipeline arrangements, and also to optimize and hedge availability risks associated with crude that we ultimately expect to use in production. Such transactions are inherently based on certain assumptions and judgments made about the current and possible future availability of crude. Therefore, when we take physical or financial positions for optimization purposes, our intent is generally to take offsetting positions in quantities and at prices that will advance these objectives while minimizing our positional and financial statement risk. However, because\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 the disposal of an equity method investment associated with the sale of asphalt terminals during the year ended December 31, 2018.  2017 vs. 2016\n \u2022 higher maintenance and other costs associated with outages at the refineries; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, Delek's retail segment includes the operations of 279 owned and leased convenience store sites located primarily in central and west Texas and New Mexico which were acquired in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. Our convenience stores typically offer various grades of gasoline and diesel under the Alon brand name and food products, food service, tobacco products, non-alcoholic and alcoholic beverages, general merchandise as well as money orders to the public, primarily under the 7-Eleven and Alon brand names pursuant to a license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. which gives us a perpetual license to use the 7-Eleven trademark, service name and trade name in west Texas and a majority of the counties in New Mexico in connection with our retail store operations. In November 2018, we terminated the license agreement with 7-Eleven, Inc. and the terms of such termination require the removal of all 7-Eleven branding on a store-by-store basis by the earlier of\n \u2022 increases in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased in our west Texas marketing operations. The average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased increased $0.23 per gallon and $0.45 per gallon, respectively, which amounted to an increase of $72.6 million in cost of materials and other. The increase in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel was partially offset by a decrease in volumes sold amounting to $13.5 million and hedging gains of $4.8 million.  2017 vs. 2016\nIncome Taxes\n \u2022 improved contribution margin in our west Texas operations as a result of continued increased drilling activity in the region and favorable market price movements; and \nA key component of our long-term strategy is our capital expenditure program. Our capital expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $317.2 million, of which approximately $203.9 million was spent in our refining segment, $11.6 million in our logistics segment, $10.0 million in our retail segment and $91.7 million at the holding company level. The following table summarizes our actual capital expenditures for 2018 and planned capital expenditures for 2019 by operating segment and major category (in millions):\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe Convertible Notes as well as the Call Options were both assumed in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. Under the Convertible Note indenture, we had the ability, at our option, to settle the Convertible Notes with cash, with stock, or with a combination of both. Under the combination option, only the accretive value of the conversion option (the portion that was \"in-the-money\") in excess of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes would be settled with shares. The Call Options were designed to hedge/offset the accretive value of the underlying conversion option only. After a careful review of our cash position and our objectives to minimize dilution by maximizing the effect of the Call Options, during 2018, we elected to settle the convertible debt for a combination of cash and stock. As a result, on a net basis, we were able to settle the Convertible Notes and the exercise of the Call Options with no net dilution to our common stock and therefore with no dilutive impact to our earnings per share.\n \u2022 a reduction in cost of materials and other attributable to a decrease in average RIN prices and RIN waivers received which resulted in an incremental net reduction of such costs as compared to the prior year.  2017 vs. 2016\n I. Safety and wellness. In the refining environment, safety is always of paramount concern. But safety, and wellness, are also critical to maximizing productivity and optimizing the use of our team members' talents and capital assets, our two most valuable resources. For these reasons, safety and wellness have become an enterprise-wide, pervasive mantra in our culture that is already resulting in fewer injuries and less downtime. For 2019, our initiatives are centered around awareness and developing programs with our employees' input to guide and support all of the business units. We believe these cultural programs will drive continued reductions in work-related recordable injuries and move us toward becoming first in class with respect to safety and wellness. \nContribution Margin\nYTD 2017 vs. YTD 2016\nNovember 2018 Warrant Unwind\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 improvements in average sales price of retail fuel per gallon to $2.63 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.34 during the six months ended December 31, 2017. \nCost of materials and other was $8,560.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $6,327.6 million for 2017, an increase of $2,232.9 million, or 35.3%. The increase in cost of materials and other primarily related to the following factors:\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI- Cushing crude oil from an average of $50.78 per barrel for 2017 to an average of $65.20 during 2018; and \nRefining Margin\nLike the California Discontinued Entities, the asphalt terminals (and related equity method investment) sold in the transaction describe above were originally acquired as part of the Delek/Alon Merger. We believe that these asphalt operations were not integral to our strategic business objectives, where maintaining focus on our core businesses and exploring growth in areas where there is opportunity to take advantage of new technology and advances in our industry as well as those opportunities with geographic customer or sourcing significance to our operations are paramount to achieving our long-term growth objectives. Therefore, we believe that divesting of these non-core operations only helps us to focus on implementing our most important strategies.\n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results. \nNet Income\n \u2022 net increases in sales volumes in our refining and logistics segments during 2017. \n \u2022 the effects of increases in the price of finished petroleum products at our refineries (including a 19.7% increase in average price of CBOB gasoline per gallon and a 22.8% increase in average price of ULSD per gallon); and \n2018 vs. 2017\n2017 vs. 2016\nForward-looking statements should not be read as a guarantee of future performance or results, and will not necessarily be accurate indications of the times at, or by, which such performance or results will be achieved.

The increase in operating expenses is primarily driven by the following:\nCost of materials and other was $6,327.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $3,812.9 million for 2016, an increase of $2,514.7 million, or 66.0%. The increase in cost of materials and other was primarily due to the following factors:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nContribution Margin\nNet Revenues\nOperating expenses increased by $15.4 million, or 35.6%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\n (1) Total sales volume includes 986, 1,592 and 622 bpd sold to the logistics segment during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total sales volume also includes sales of 193, 129 and 510 bpd of intermediate and finished products to the El Dorado refinery during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Total sales volume also includes 399 and 546 bpd of produced finished product sold to the Big Spring refinery for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and 232 bpd sold to the Krotz Springs refinery during the year ended December 31, 2018. Total sales volume excludes 4,444, 4,209 and 1,281 bpd of wholesale activity during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n \u2022 diminution in value of long-lived assets may result in an impairment in the carrying value of the assets on our balance sheet and a resultant loss recognized in the statement of operations; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 increases in labor and utilities costs associated with certain of our pipelines as a result of increased usage; \nWe are an integrated downstream energy business focused on petroleum refining, the transportation, storage and wholesale distribution of crude oil, intermediate and refined products and convenience store retailing. Effective July 1, 2017, we acquired through the Delek/Alon the operations and net assets of Alon, as discussed in the 'Recent Strategic Developments' section of Item 1, Business, and as discussed in Note 3 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The Delek/Alon Merger continues to have a significant impact on our revenue and profitability as well as earnings per share, our net asset position, our purchasing position in the marketplace, our footprint in the refining industry, especially in the Gulf Coast Region/Permian Basin, and our ability to go to market and secure financing, and we continue to realize synergies from our combined operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $319.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $248.0 million for 2016. The increase in cash flows from operations was primarily due to an increase in net income for 2017 of $322.6 million, compared to net loss of $133.4 million in 2016 and a decrease in cash used to pay the obligation under the supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron of $113.0 million, partially offset by the non-cash gain on the remeasurement of the equity method investment in Alon of $190.1 million and increases in accounts receivable and inventory and other non-current assets. The net loss in 2016 included a non-cash impairment in our equity method investment in Alon USA of $245.3 million. Additionally, the disposed retail segment provided $13.3 million of cash flows from operations in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017.\n (1) Retail fuel margin represents gross margin on fuel sales in the retail segment, and is calculated as retail fuel sales revenue less retail fuel cost of sales. The retail fuel margin per gallon calculation is derived by dividing retail fuel margin by the total retail fuel gallons sold for the period. \nOn November 8, 2017, Delek and the Alon Partnership (as defined in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Delek agreed to acquire all of the outstanding limited partner units which Delek did not already own in an all-equity transaction. This transaction was approved by all voting members of the board of directors of the general partner of the Alon Partnership upon the recommendation from its conflicts committee and by the board of directors of Delek. This transaction closed on February 7, 2018 (the \"Merger Date\"). Delek owned approximately 51.0 million limited partner units of the Alon Partnership, or approximately 81.6% of the outstanding units immediately prior to the Merger Date. Under terms of the merger agreement, the owners of the remaining outstanding units in the Alon Partnership that Delek did not currently own immediately prior to the Merger Date received a fixed exchange ratio of 0.49 shares of New Delek common stock for each limited partner unit of the Alon Partnership, resulting in the issuance of approximately 5.6 million shares of New Delek Common Stock to the public unitholders of the Alon Partnership. The limited partner interests of the Alon Partnership prior to this acquisition were represented as common units outstanding. Because the transaction represented a combination of ownership interests under common control, the transfer of equity from non-controlling interest\nCost of Materials and Other\nIn March 2018, a subsidiary of Delek Logistics completed the acquisition from Delek of storage tanks and terminals that support our Big Spring refinery in the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition (as defined in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). In addition, a new marketing agreement was entered into between subsidiary of Delek Logistics and Delek pursuant to which such subsidiary of Delek Logistics will provide marketing services for product sales from the Big Spring refinery. The cash paid for the transferred assets was $170.8 million and the cash paid for the marketing agreement was $144.2 million. The transactions were financed with borrowings under the DKL Credit Facility (as defined in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 1, Financial Statements).\n \u2022 increased net revenue related to the Paline Pipeline as a result of volume increases on the pipeline.  Net revenues included $33.0 million and $20.4 million of net service fees paid by our refining segment to our logistics segment during the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These service fees are based on the number of gallons sold and a shared portion of the margin achieved in return for providing sales and customer support services, and includes fees earned under the marketing agreement entered into in connection with the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition. Net revenues also included crude and refined product transportation, terminalling and storage fees paid by our refining segment to our logistics segment, which includes revenues earned under the commercial agreements entered into in connection with the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition. These fees were $200.4 million and $129.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The logistics segment received management fees of $4.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, from the Corporate/Other segment for the management of a long-term capital project on behalf of the Company for the construction of a gathering system in the Permian Basin, as discussed further in Note 4 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. The logistics segment also sold $2.6 million and $5.6 million of RINs to the refining segment for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. These intercompany sales and fees are eliminated in consolidation.\n\nAs US crude oil production has increased, we have seen the discount for WTI Cushing widen compared to Brent. This generally leads to higher margins in our refineries as refined product prices are influenced by Brent crude prices and the majority of our crude supply is WTI-linked. The discount for WTI Cushing compared to Brent increased to $6.49 during 2018 from $3.95 during 2017. We note similar historical trends when reviewing the average discount for LLS compared to WTI Cushing, where the average discount increased to $4.99 during 2018 from $3.23 during 2017. Additionally, our refineries continue to have greater access to WTI Midland and WTI Midland-linked crude feedstocks compared to certain of our competitors. The average discount for WTI Midland compared to WTI Cushing increased to $7.36 during 2018 from $0.34 during 2017. As these price discounts increase, so does our competitive advantage, created by our access to WTI-linked crude oil. The chart below illustrates the differentials of both Brent crude oil and WTI Midland crude oil as compared to WTI Cushing crude oil as well as WTI Cushing as compared to LLS over the past three years.\nConsolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $322.6 million compared to a net loss of $133.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Consolidated net income attributable to Delek for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $288.8 million, or $4.04 per basic share, compared to a net loss of $153.7 million, or $2.49 per basic share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Explanations for significant drivers impacting net income as compared to the comparable period of the prior year are discussed in the sections below.\n \u2022 an increase in employee related costs resulting from increases in incentive plan costs and the addition of employees in connection with the integration of the acquisition of Alon; and \nNet cash used in financing activities was $104.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $61.7 million for 2016. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to net repayments under our revolving credit facilities of $117.7 million in 2017, compared to $41.1 million in 2016, an increase in repurchases of common stock of $19.0 million, an increase in distributions to non-controlling interest of $11.6 million, an increase in dividends paid of $6.5 million, and an increase in deferred financing costs paid of $4.4 million, offset by net borrowings under our term loans of $182.6 million during 2017 compared to net repayments of $14.7 million in 2016 and an increase in proceeds net of repayments associated with product financing agreements of $52.3 million. Additionally, the disposed retail segment used $17.5 million of cash flows from financing activities associated with debt repayments in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017.\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed cost of materials and other of $1,531.90 million during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger); \n \u2022 wider discounts between WTI Cushing crude oil compared to Brent and WTI Midland crude oil compared to WTI Cushing which impact refining margin at the Tyler and El Dorado Refineries where, during the year ended December 31, 2018, the average WTI Cushing crude oil differential to Brent crude oil was $6.49 per barrel compared to $3.95 during the year ended December 31, 2017, and the average WTI Midland crude oil differential to WTI Cushing crude oil was $7.36 per barrel compared to $0.34 during the year ended December 31, 2017; \n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \nContribution margin increased by $414.4 million, or a 2.8% improvement in contribution margin percentage, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Reform Act\") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform Act reduces the US federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, provides for immediate deduction of qualified capital assets placed in service, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.At December 31, 2017, we made a reasonable estimate of the effects of the Tax Reform Act on our existing deferred tax balances, and recognized a provisional benefit amount of $166.9 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21% for federal purposes. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we completed the analysis of the accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the Act, resulting in our recording of an additional tax benefit of $0.6 million during 2018. These adjustments to the previously recorded provisional amounts include the effects on the existing deferred tax balances and executive compensation.\n\nIn order to determine fair value, management must make certain estimates and assumptions including, among other things, projected cash flows, a credit-adjusted risk-free rate and an assessment of market conditions that could significantly impact the estimated fair value of the asset retirement obligations. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \n \u2022 a 1.5% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread; and \nAs of December 31, 2018, our total cash and cash equivalents were $1,079.3 million and we had total indebtedness of approximately $1,783.3 million. Total unused credit commitments or borrowing base availability, as applicable, under our three separate revolving credit facilities was approximately $913.9 million, and we had letters of credit issued of approximately $179.4 million. We believe we were in compliance with our covenants in all debt facilities as of December 31, 2018.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n2018 vs. 2017\nOther expense (income), net was $(6.1) million and $0.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $6.5 million. The increase was primarily driven by the recognition of net periodic benefit cost, exclusive of service costs, associated with our defined benefit pension plans assumed in the Delek/Alon merger.\nNet revenues for the refining segment increased $2,989.8 million, or 45.2% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 increases in information technology expenses related to system upgrades, security and licensing.  2017 vs. 2016\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \"Exchange Act\"). These forward-looking statements reflect our current estimates, expectations and projections about our future results, performance, prospects and opportunities. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, the information concerning our planned capital expenditures by segment for 2019, possible future results of operations, business and growth strategies, financing plans, expectations that regulatory developments or other matters will or will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition, our competitive position and the effects of competition, the projected growth of the industry in which we operate, and the benefits and synergies to be obtained from our completed and any future acquisitions, statements of management's goals and objectives, and other similar expressions concerning matters that are not historical facts.

The Krotz Springs refinery has the capability to process substantial volumes of light sweet, crude oils to produce a high percentage of refined light products. \n \u2022 volatility in our refining margins or fuel gross profit as a result of changes in the prices of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products; \nOn January 23, 2018, Delek repurchased 2.0 million shares of its common stock from Alon Israel in connection with Delek's rights pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement dated April 14, 2015 by and between Delek and Alon Israel. Alon Israel delivered a right of first offer notice to Delek on January 16, 2018, informing Delek of Alon Israel's intention to sell the 2.0 million shares, and Delek accepted such offer on January 17, 2018. The total purchase price was approximately $75.3 million, or $37.64 per share. In the aggregate, pursuant to various share repurchase programs approved by our Board of Directors, we have repurchased 9,022,386 shares for a total of approximately $365.3 million since December 31, 2017. As of February 22, 2019, there is approximately $409.7 million of authorization remaining under Delek's aggregate stock repurchase program (based on repurchases that had settled as of February 22, 2019). See further discussion in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMarch 30, 2018 Delek Revolver and Term Loan\nSubstantially all of the motor fuel sold through our retail segment is supplied by our Big Spring refinery, which is transferred to the retail segment at prices substantially determined by reference to published commodity pricing information.\nDuring January 2019, we also amended the El Dorado refinery and the Krotz Springs refinery Supply and Offtake Agreements with J. Aron so that the repurchase of baseline volumes at the end of the Supply and Offtake Agreement term (representing the Baseline Step-Out Liabilities) will be based upon a fixed price instead of a market-indexed price and therefore subject to changes in fair value that reflect changes in interest rate risk rather than commodity price risk. See further discussion in Note 24 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 higher employee costs, primarily payroll expense, allocated to us as a result of increases in allocated employee headcount and employee incentive costs; \n \u2022 an increase in net average borrowings outstanding (including the obligations under the supply and offtake agreements which have an associated interest charge) of approximately $594.0 million (calculated as a simple average of beginning borrowings/obligations and ending borrowings/obligations for the period) for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, where a significant driver of the increase in borrowings related to the assumption of debt/obligations in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger.  2017 vs. 2016\nThe refining segment processes crude oil and other purchased feedstocks for the manufacture of transportation motor fuels, including various grades of gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation fuel, asphalt and other petroleum-based products that are distributed through owned and third-party product terminals. It had a combined nameplate capacity of 302,000 barrels per day as of December 31, 2018. Prior to the Delek/Alon Merger, the refining segment operated refineries in Tyler, Texas (the \"Tyler refinery\") and El Dorado, Arkansas (the \"El Dorado refinery\") with a combined design crude throughput (nameplate) capacity of 155,000 barrels per day (\"bpd\"), including the 75,000 bpd Tyler refinery and the 80,000 bpd El Dorado refinery. Effective with the Delek/Alon Merger, our refining segment now also includes a crude oil refinery located in Big Spring, Texas (the \"Big Spring refinery\") with a nameplate capacity of 73,000 bpd, a crude oil refinery located in Krotz Springs, Louisiana (the \"Krotz Springs refinery\") with a nameplate capacity of 74,000 bpd. Our refining segment also included two biodiesel facilities we own and operate that are engaged in the production of biodiesel fuels and related activities, located in Crossett, Arkansas and Cleburne, Texas.\nContribution margin increased by $374.8 million, or a 3.2% improvement in contribution margin percentage, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the following:\n \u2022 the addition of Alon as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed general and administrative expenses of $37.4 during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger), as well as additional absorbed overhead cost, integration costs and related transaction costs incurred during 2017; and \nCost of Materials and Other\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 the recognition of the inventory fair value adjustment associated with purchase accounting as an increase in cost of materials and other during 2017 totaling $33.2 million, as the inventory acquired was sold; and \n (2) Total sales volume includes 1,387, 514, and 102 bpd of produced finished product sold to the Tyler refinery during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 27,048 bpd and 302 of produced finished product sold to the Krotz Springs and Big Spring refineries, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. There were 140 bpd of produced finished product sold to the logistics segment and 17 bpd sold to the retail segment during the year ended December 31, 2018. In addition, 406 and 2,247 bpd of produced finished product was sold to Alon Asphalt Company during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Total sales volume excludes 47,422, 25,750 and 20,329 bpd of wholesale activity during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. \n\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed net incremental revenues of $2,710.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months; and \n \u2022 expense associated with the termination of our license agreement with 7-Eleven in 2018.  2017 vs. 2016\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nNet revenues for the refining segment increased $2,697.4 million, or 68.8% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 changes in our ability to continue to access the credit markets; \n \u2022 disruption, failure, or cybersecurity breaches affecting or targeting our IT systems and controls, our infrastructure, or the infrastructure of our cloud-based IT service providers; \n \u2022 the cost of materials and other benefit attributable to the RIN waivers.  2017 vs. 2016\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n(1) Statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2018 reflects a $5.5 million adjustment to increase income tax expense related to the establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets and to decrease net income and net income attributable to Delek, and reducing basic and diluted income per share by $0.07 and $0.06, respectively, that were not reflected in the Earnings Release furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K filed with the SEC on February 20, 2019 (the \"Earnings Release\"). Such adjustment has no impact on adjusted net income or adjusted net income per share (as defined in the Earnings Release). See further discussion in Notes 15 and 23 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 higher costs associated with operating certain of our terminals as a result of volume increases at such terminals; and \nOperating Expenses\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nInterest Expense\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDelek recognizes liabilities which represent the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities, including those that are conditional on a future event, when the amount can be reasonably estimated. If a reasonable estimate cannot be made at the time the liability is incurred, we record the liability when sufficient information is available to estimate the liability's fair value.\n \u2022 additional costs associated with various spills at the El Dorado refinery; \n I. Become nationally recognized for safety and wellness leadership, \n (4) Sales volume includes 19,039 and 728 bpd sold to the El Dorado refinery and 606 and 60 bpd sold to the Tyler refinery during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 higher operating costs at our refineries associated with various spills, maintenance, outages and increased utility expenses; and \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we incurred certain infrequently occurring expenses/charges that were not incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. These included a $9.1 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the Refinancing and an impairment loss on assets held for sale totaling approximately $27.5 million related to the asphalt assets held for sale. These charges were partially offset by a realized gain on the sale of certain asphalt assets totaling $13.3 million, including a gain on the sale of an asphalt equity method investment. See Notes 8 and 11 of the consolidated financial statements in Item 15, Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, for additional information.\nCost of materials and other for the logistics segment increased $56.2 million, or 15.1%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the following:\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 higher employee related expenses due to increased headcount, overtime and employee incentive costs; \n \u2022 a $166.9 million benefit attributable to the impact of applying the Tax Reform Act to our existing net deferred tax liabilities in 2017. \n II. Maximize return on assets through best-in-industry reliability and integrity, \n \u2022 an increase in the cost of crude oil feedstocks at the refineries including an increase in the cost of WTI Cushing crude oil from an average of $43.33 per barrel to an average of $50.78, and an increase in the cost of WTI Midland crude oil from an average of $43.25 per barrel to an average of $50.44; \nResults from Equity Method Investments\nA Look to the Future: Our Strategic Goals\n \u2022 decreases in revenues on our Paline Pipeline System. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Paline Pipeline System was FERC regulated pipeline with a tariff established for potential shippers, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, when the pipeline capacity was under contract with two third parties for a monthly fee.  Net revenues included $20.4 million and $16.9 million of net service fees in our east Texas marketing business, paid by our refining segment during 2017 and 2016, respectively. These service fees are based on the number of gallons sold and a shared portion of the margin achieved in return for providing sales and customer support services. Net revenues also include crude, intermediate and refined product transportation, terminalling and storage fees paid by our refining segment. These fees were $129.6 million and $123.2 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The logistics segment also sold $5.6 million and $6.7 million of RINs, at market prices, to the refining segment during 2017 and 2016, respectively. These intercompany sales and fees are eliminated in consolidation.\n \u2022 increases in the price of U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline, ULSD and HSD, where increases in sales volume at he Tyler, Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries were offset by a decrease in sales volumes at the El Dorado refinery.  2017 vs. 2016\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe California Discontinued Entities were acquired as part of the Delek/Alon Merger and (as discussed in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) consisted primarily of non-operating refineries as well as a small renewables facility. As part of the acquisition, we evaluated the viability of the facilities and their potential for growth and profitability measured against their current operational cost and environmental risk exposure, and a strategic decision was made to divest of these assets. Intensive efforts were made to find suitable buyers with the objective of minimizing both our losses on the sale transactions as well as any on-going environmental exposures (See discussion of environmental exposures in Note 14 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and, as a result, we successfully closed on the divestitures of all of the California Discontinued Entities during 2018. We believe that the elimination of these Entities provides for the immediate elimination of the financial drain on our operating results while enabling us to divert resources that had previously been charged with managing these assets to more strategic efforts.\n \u2022 an increase in sales volumes in our refining and logistics segments.  Such increases were partially offset by:\nRefining Segment\n \u2022 other factors discussed under Item 1A, Risk Factors and Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in our other filings with the SEC.  In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, our actual results of operations and execution of our business strategy could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements, and you should not place undue reliance upon them. In addition, past financial and/or operating performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance, and you should not use our historical performance to anticipate future results or period trends. We can give no assurances that any of the events anticipated by any forward-looking statements will occur or, if any of them do, what impact they will have on our results of operations and financial condition.\n \u2022 employee incentive costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017, with no comparable costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.  These increases were partially offset by the following:\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed operating expenses of $172.6 during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger). \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 reliability of our operating assets; \nInterest expense was $93.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $54.4 million for 2016, an increase of $39.4 million, or 72.4%. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 Capitalize on the successful integration of the Alon transaction. During 2017 and 2018 we expended significant efforts to fully integrate the Alon organization. Now that the integration is complete, our goal is to continue to implement best practices to improve the performance of our larger organization which includes focusing on simplifying the organization structure and the balance sheet. We are continuing to realize synergies that are expected to have a positive effect on our combined operations. \n \u2022 increases in cost per gallon of fuel sold to $2.39 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.15 during the six months ended December 31, 2017. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOur results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in the prices of certain commodities, including, but not limited to, crude oil, gasoline, distillate fuel, biofuels and natural gas and electricity, among others. Historically, our profitability has been affected by commodity price volatility, specifically as it relates to the price of crude oil and refined products.\nCost of materials and other for the retail segment increased by $405.5 million, or 115.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 increases in the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased in our west Texas marketing operations. The average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel increased $0.27 per gallon and $0.31 per gallon, respectively; and \n2018 vs. 2017\nWe generated net revenues of $7,267.1 million and $4,197.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $3,069.2 million, or 73.1%. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the following factors:\nOperating expenses (included in both cost of sales and other operating expenses) were $645.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $429.0 million in 2017, an increase of $216.0 million, or 50.3%. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 identifying and managing operational and financial risks to improve operational decision-making and increase profitability.  In addition to the significant initiatives/developments described above, we entered into several other strategic transactions in order to improve our financial position or enhance shareholder value since December 31, 2017, some of the most significant of which are described below.\nSeptember 2018 Settlement of Convertible Debt and Related Call Options\nEnvironmental regulations continue to affect our margins in the form of the increasing RINs cost. On a consolidated basis, we work to balance our RINs obligations in order to minimize the effect of RINs on our results. While we generate RINs in both of our refining and logistics segments through our ethanol blending and biodiesel production, our refining segment needs to purchase additional RINs to satisfy its obligations. As a result, increases in the price of RINs generally adversely affect our results of operations. It is not possible at this time to predict with certainty what future volumes or costs may be, but given the increase in required volumes and the volatile price of RINs, the cost of purchasing sufficient RINs could have an adverse impact on our results of operations if we are unable to recover those costs in the price of our refined products. The chart below illustrates the volatile nature of the price for RINs over the past three years.\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of crude oil feedstocks at the refineries including an increase in the cost of WTI Cushing crude oil from an average of $50.78 per barrel to an average of $65.20, and an increase in the cost of WTI Midland crude oil from an average of $50.44 per barrel to an average of $57.84; and \nThe fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend our business activities. We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP, and in the process of applying these principles, we must make judgments, assumptions and estimates based on the best available information at the time. To aid a reader's understanding, management has identified our critical accounting policies. These policies are considered critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results, and require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments. Often they require judgments and estimation about matters which are inherently uncertain and involve measuring at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. Actual results may differ based on the accuracy of the information utilized and subsequent events, some over which we may have little or no control.\nCapital Spending\nTransactions designed to maximize return on assets\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger on July 1, 2017; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of refined products in the logistics segment where the average cost per gallon of gasoline and diesel purchased increased $0.27 per gallon and $0.31 per gallon, respectively; and \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nWe recognized income from equity method investments of $9.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $2.9 million. This decrease was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 actions of our competitors and customers; \nCash Flows\nWith respect to measuring our refining margins at our refineries, we consider the following:\n \u2022 increases in the average sales prices per gallon of gasoline and diesel sold in our west Texas marketing operations. The average sales prices increased $0.32 per gallon and $0.39 per gallon, respectively; \nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 2-1-1 crack spread (Krotz Springs benchmark) for the past three years, where we have owned the Krotz Springs refinery only since the Delek/Alon Merger.\n \u2022 improvements in our west Texas wholesale marketing margin per barrel as a result of a period of product supply disruptions associated with Hurricane Harvey; and \n V. Positioning for growth. We have a history of achieving growth, largely through acquisitions. Our view for the future includes continuing to identify acquisition targets that are strategic as well as accretive while also exploring the possibility of capital investment opportunities in new technology and alternative energy.  We believe that these strategic objectives and areas of focus are representative of our desire to maximize the opportunities both within and external to the organization in a way that is innovative and forward-thinking, while incorporating some of the strategies that have been essential to our story so far and are part of who we are as a company.\n2018 vs. 2017\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 the absence of an equity method investment in Alon during the last half of 2017, in which we recognized our proportionate share of the net income from our investment in Alon of $4.5 million, net of $1.3 million in amortization of the excess of our investment over our equity in the underlying net assets of Alon, as compared to our proportionate share of the net loss from our investment in Alon of $39.6 million and $2.6 million in amortization of the excess of our investment over our equity in the underlying net assets of Alon for 2016; and \n \u2022 compliance, or failure to comply, with restrictive and financial covenants in our various debt agreements; \nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash generated from our operating activities, borrowings under our debt facilities and potential issuances of additional equity and debt securities. We believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to satisfy the anticipated cash requirements associated with our existing operations and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K regarding our available debt facilities.\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\nWe report operating results in three reportable segments: refining, logistics and retail. Decisions concerning the allocation of resources and assessment of operating performance are made based on this segmentation. Management measures the operating performance of each of its reportable segments based on the segment contribution margin.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $247.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $175.9 million in 2017, an increase of $71.7 million, or 40.8%. The increase was primarily driven by the following factors:\nInterest expense was $125.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $93.8 million for 2017, an increase of $32.1 million, or 34.2%. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe logistics segment's pipelines and transportation business owns or leases capacity on approximately 400 miles of crude oil transportation pipelines, approximately 450 miles of refined product pipelines, an approximately 600-mile crude oil gathering system and associated crude oil storage tanks with an aggregate of approximately 9.6 million barrels of active shell capacity. Our logistics segment owns and operates nine light product terminals and markets light products using third-party terminals.\n2018 vs. 2017\n III. Improve efficiency and execution through development of systems and processes, \nIn our retail segment, we are actively implementing strategic initiatives to reduce our reliance on external brands and to optimize the performance of our portfolio of stores. We are rolling out our own branding initiatives which we will optimize in our current geographic areas as well as emerging markets. As a result of these efforts, we elected to terminate the 7-Eleven licensing agreement (as discussed above) with the current intention to re-brand with our own brand to capitalize on and build our brand recognition in the applicable regions. Additionally, we sold 15 under-performing or non-strategic store locations during the fourth quarter of 2018 and have plans to sell 28 additional stores during the first quarter of 2019. While the proceeds and resultant gains on sale of such related assets were not significant to our financial results as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, removing these stores from our portfolio enables us to better focus our retail management and operational efforts on individual store performance, strategic optimization and growth opportunities which may include not only rebranding but possibly also expansion initiatives.\nWe continue to be focused on utilizing our assets to their optimal utility in the framework of our business, and that means strategically aligning our logistics assets with our Delek Logistics business. Such alignment enhances, not only Delek Logistics' growth opportunities, but also our ability to best service the mutually beneficial commercial agreements between Delek Logistics and Delek. This drop-down of logistics assets to Delek Logistics specifically contributes to our ability to provide logistics services to our Big Spring refinery while growing our logistics infrastructure and potential for synergies.\n \u2022 increases in revenue generated under the agreements executed in connection with the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition as described above.  2017 vs. 2016\nThe amount of our capital expenditure budget is subject to change due to unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our capital projects and subject to the changes and uncertainties discussed under the 'Forward-Looking Statements' section of Item 7, Management Discussion and Analysis, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information, please refer to our discussion in Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 a gain on asset disposal of $0.9 million partially driven by the sale of 14 retail stores. \nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread (Big Spring benchmark) for the past three years, where we have owned the Big Spring refinery only since the Delek/Alon Merger.\nOperating Segments\n \u2022 reduction in operating expenses for one of our terminal locations at which we incurred increased costs related to internal tank contamination during the year ended December 31, 2016 that were not incurred during the year ended December 31, 2017. \nRefining margin increased by $459.3 million or 73.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, with a refining margin percentage of 11.6% as compared to 7.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily driven by the following:\nRetail Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nIncome tax benefit was $29.2 million and $171.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, a decrease of $142.3 million, reflecting a decrease in our effective tax rate from 43.8% for 2016 to (9.8)% for 2017. The decrease in benefit was primarily driven by the following:\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread (Tyler and El Dorado benchmark) for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nLogistics Segment Operational Comparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2018 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2017 and the Year Ended December 31, 2017 versus the Year Ended December 31, 2016\nIn assessing the recoverability of goodwill, assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit. We may consider inputs such as a market participant weighted average cost of capital, estimated growth rates for revenue, gross profit and capital expenditures based on history and our best estimate of future forecasts, all of which are subject to significant judgment and estimates. We may also estimate the fair values of the reporting units using a multiple of expected future cash flows, such as those used by third-party analysts. If these estimates and assumptions change in the future, due to factors such as a decline in general economic conditions, competitive pressures on sales and margins and other economic and industry factors beyond management's control, an impairment charge may be required. A significant risk to our future results and the potential future impairment of goodwill is the volatility of the crude oil and the refined product markets which is often unpredictable and may negatively impact our results of operations in ways that cannot be anticipated and that are beyond management's control.\n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results; and \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 Enhance our position in the Permian Basin. Our 302,000 barrels per day of crude throughput capacity is primarily a WTI-linked crude oil slate that is weighted to supply from the Permian Basin through our access to approximately 200,000 barrels per day. In addition, we have complementary retail and logistics presence in the area. Our strategic focus will be to evaluate options to utilize our position to create additional growth across our businesses, while working toward reducing our susceptibility to volatility in the crude and refined product markets. \nOperating expenses for the retail segment increased by $51.1 million, or 103.0% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nInformation regarding our known contractual obligations of the types described below as of December 31, 2018, is set forth in the following table (in millions):\nNet Revenues\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n\n(1) Excludes jet fuel and petroleum coke.\nOn September 17, 2018, we exercised the Call Options (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K) in connection with the settlement of the Convertible Notes and received approximately 2.7 million shares of our common stock from the Call Option counterparties, a cash payment for dividends of approximately $0.3 million and a nominal cash payment in lieu of fractional shares. See further discussion in Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 improvements in average sales price of retail fuel per gallon to $2.63 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.34 during the six months ended December 31, 2017, or an increase of 12.5%, where cost per gallon of fuel sold increased to $2.39 during the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $2.15 during the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 11.2%.  The following chart compares the retail fuel margin results for the year ended December 31, 2018 to six months ended December 31, 2017:\nThe following table provides summary financial data for Delek (in millions):\n\n \u2022 increased fees under our marketing agreement with Delek Holdings as a result of increased throughput due to higher demand following product supply disruptions associated with Hurricane Harvey, partially offset by a decline in fees on our Paline Pipeline System; and \nOperating expenses increased $147.7 million, or 46.5% in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:\n2018 vs. 2017\n(3) We have supply agreements to secure certain quantities of crude oil, finished product and other resources used in production at both fixed and market prices. We have estimated future payments under the market based agreements using current market rates. Excludes purchase commitments in buy-sell transactions which have matching notional amounts with the same counterparty and are generally net settled.\nRefining Overview\nOur 2018 Strategic Goals\nNet revenues increased $90.0 million, or 20.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 an increase in the cost of WTI - Midland crude oil, from an average of $50.44 per barrel for 2017 to an average of $57.84 during 2018. \nSuch increases were partially offset by:\n(3) Consists of terminalling throughputs at our Tyler, Big Spring, Big Sandy and Mount Pleasant, Texas, El Dorado and North Little Rock, Arkansas and Memphis and Nashville, Tennessee terminals. Throughputs for the year ended December 31, 2018 for the Big Spring terminal are for 306 days we operated the terminal following its acquisition effective March 1, 2018. Barrels per day are calculated for only the days we operated each terminal. Total throughput barrels for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 56.6 million barrels, which averaged 155,193 bpd per the period.\nThe Company's overall strategy has been to take a disciplined approach that looks to balance returning cash to our shareholders and prudently investing in the business to support safe and reliable operations, while exploring opportunities for growth. Our goal has been to balance the different aspects of this program based on evaluations of each opportunity and how it matches our strategic goals for the company, while factoring in market conditions and expected cash generation. The following is a summary of our most significant 2018 strategic goals:\nAs was the case for the Convertible Notes and the Call Options, the existing common stock Warrants were also assumed in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger. The Warrant agreements provided for the issuance of a certain number of warrants exchangeable for shares of our common stock at a strike price that would have become exercisable beginning in December 2018, and that have been dilutive to our earnings per share calculation during the last three quarters of 2018. By entering into this Unwind Agreement, we were able to limit the upward accretive value of the instrument to its holders and eliminate its dilutive effect, causing an immediate and significant favorable impact on earnings per share.\n \u2022 a $16.0 million reduction of operating expenses attributed to recoveries received from the settlement of disputed indemnification matters related to environmental obligations and asset retirement obligations at the Bakersfield Refinery.  2017 vs. 2016\nNet Revenues\n(2) Amounts reflect future estimated lease payments under operating leases having remaining non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of December 31, 2018.\nBusiness Overview\nCost of materials increased $2,238.1 million, or 61.9% in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by the following:\n2018 Strategic Developments\n \u2022 pre-tax income of $485.5 million compared to $299.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and an increase in our effective tax rate which was 21.0% compared to (9.8)% for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \n \u2022 the addition of Alon as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed incremental general and administrative expenses of $31.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months of Alon operating results; \nContribution margin increased by $13.2 million, or 12.1% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 the addition of Alon property, plant and equipment of $1,130.3 million and the addition of amortizable intangibles of $61.3 million as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, combined with the addition of other capital expenditures and acquisitions (net of disposals) completed to date, where such additions contributed $45.3 million in incremental depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2018, which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months of Alon operating results.  2017 vs. 2016\n \u2022 a 41.6% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread; and \nOur logistics segment gathers, transports and stores crude oil and markets, distributes, transports and stores refined products in select regions of the southeastern United States and west Texas for our refining segment and third parties. It is comprised of the consolidated balance sheet and results of operations of Delek Logistics Partners, LP (\"Delek Logistics\", NYSE:DKL), where we owned a 61.4% limited partner interest (at December 31, 2018) in Delek Logistics and a 94.6% interest in the entity that owns the entire 2.0% general partner interest in Delek Logistics and all of the incentive distribution rights. Delek Logistics was formed by Delek in 2012 to own, operate, acquire and construct crude oil and refined products logistics and marketing assets. A substantial majority of Delek Logistics' assets are currently integral to our refining and marketing operations.\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 Grow our logistics operations. The combination of our access to the Permian Basin and larger refining operation should allow us to continue to grow our logistics footprint. We will look for opportunities to capitalize on this position to increase our crude gathering operations, support the refining system and third party customers. This includes exploring opportunities for continued development through joint ventures and opportunities to acquire assets in markets that are complementary to our existing geographic footprint. \nRetail Overview\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed net incremental cost of materials and other of $2,159.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 which included twelve months of Alon operating results, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which included only six months of Alon operating results; \nNet cash provided by investing activities was $37.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $200.7 million in 2016. This decrease in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to an increase in cash purchases of property, plant and equipment, which increased from $46.3 million in 2016 to $172.0 million in 2017. Additionally, the disposed retail segment provided $288.9 million of cash flows from investing activities in 2016 that was not recurring in 2017, while the California Discontinued Entities provided $12.2 million of cash flows from investing activities in 2017. This decrease was partially offset by the the cash acquired in the Delek/Alon Merger of $200.5 million (excluding the cash acquired attributable to the California Discontinued Entities) and a decrease in equity method contributions of $55.8 million.\n\n \u2022 higher operating costs in our logistics segment associated with increased volumes at our terminals and maintenance costs.  Such increases were partially offset by:\n \u2022 operating hazards, natural disasters, casualty losses and other matters beyond our control; \n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger on July 1, 2017; \n \u2022 For our Tyler refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread. The Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread is used as a benchmark for measuring a refinery's product margins by measuring the difference between the market price of light products and crude oil, and represents the approximate refined product margin resulting from processing one barrel of crude oil into three-fifths barrel of gasoline and two-fifths barrel of high-sulfur diesel. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nNet revenues for the retail segment increased by $488.7 million, or 114.5% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n(1) Expected interest payments on debt outstanding at December 31, 2018. Floating interest rate debt is calculated using December 31, 2018 rates. For additional information, see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\n \u2022 addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n (3) Total sales volume includes 13,967 and 15,190 bpd sold to the retail segment, 10,005 and 176 bpd sold to the logistics segment and 1,688 and 1,510 bpd sold to Alon Asphalt Company during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. \nExecutive Summary and Strategic Overview\n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 acts of terrorism (including cyber-terrorism) aimed at either our facilities or other facilities that could impair our ability to produce or transport refined products or receive feedstocks; \n \u2022 increase in other miscellaneous income, including decrease in reserves related to pending litigation and the relieving of certain retail deposits.  Such increases were partially offset by:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nIt is our policy to accrue environmental and clean-up related costs of a non-capital nature when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Environmental liabilities represent the current estimated costs to investigate and remediate contamination at our properties. This estimate is based on internal and third-party assessments of the extent of the contamination, the selected remediation technology and review of applicable environmental regulations, typically considering estimated activities and costs for 15 years, and up to 30 years if a longer period is believed reasonably necessary. Accruals for estimated costs from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study and include, but are not limited to, costs to perform remedial actions and costs of machinery and equipment that are dedicated to the remedial actions and that do not have an alternative use. Such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change. We discount environmental liabilities to their present value if payments are fixed and determinable. Expenditures for equipment necessary for environmental issues relating to ongoing operations are capitalized.\nWe believe the accounting estimate related to the establishment of anticipated year-end LIFO inventory is a critical accounting estimate, because it requires management to make assumptions about future production rates in the Tyler refinery, the future buying patterns of our customers, as well as numerous other factors beyond our control, including the economic viability of the general economy, weather conditions, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. The impact of changes in actual performance versus these estimates could be material to the inventories reported on our quarterly balance sheets, and the impact on the results reported in our quarterly statements of income could be material. In selecting assumed inventory levels, we use historical trending of production and sales, recognition of current market indicators of future pricing and value and new regulatory requirements which might impact inventory levels. Management's assumptions require significant judgment because actual year-end inventory levels have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so.\nOther operating (income) expense, net was $(31.3) million and $1.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $(32.3) million. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\n \u2022 general economic and business conditions affecting the southern, southwestern and western United States, particularly levels of spending related to travel and tourism; \nOur profitability in the refining segment is substantially determined by the difference between the cost of the crude oil feedstocks we purchase and the price of the refined products we sell, referred to as the \"crack spread\", \"refining margin\" or \"refined product margin\". The cost to acquire feedstocks and the price of the refined petroleum products we ultimately sell from our refineries depend on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions such as hurricanes or tornadoes, local, domestic and foreign political affairs, global conflict, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. Other significant factors that influence our results in the refining segment include operating costs (particularly the cost of natural gas used for fuel and the cost of electricity), seasonal factors, refinery utilization rates and planned or unplanned maintenance activities or turnarounds. Moreover, while the fluctuations in the cost of crude oil are typically reflected in the prices of light refined products, such as gasoline and diesel fuel, the price of other residual products, such as asphalt, coke, carbon black oil and LPG are less likely to move in parallel with crude cost. This could cause additional pressure on our realized margin during periods of rising or falling crude oil prices. Additionally, our margins are impacted by the pricing differentials of the various types and sources of crude oil we use at our refineries and their relation to product pricing, such as the differentials between WTI Midland and WTI Cushing or WTI Midland and Brent crude oil.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n2018 and 2019 Share Repurchases\n2018 vs. 2017\nLIFO Inventory\n \u2022 improved contribution margin in our west Texas operations as a result of increased drilling activity in the region, which has improved market conditions and increased demand; \n \u2022 reduction in RINs expense, primarily associated with the $47.5 million reduction in RINs expense associated with the RINs waiver received by the El Dorado refinery in the first quarter of 2017.  These increases were partially offset by the following:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $560.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $319.7 million for the comparable period of 2017. The increase in cash flows from operations was partially due to an increase in net income, which for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $374.9 million, compared to $322.6 million in the same period of 2017. A decrease in cash used to purchase inventory and other current assets and increase in cash received on accounts receivable also contributed to the increase in cash flows from operations. Additionally, in the year ended December 31, 2017, net income included a non-cash gain on remeasurement of equity method investment of $190.1 million for which there was no comparable activity in the current period. This increase was partially offset by increases in cash used to pay accounts payable and other current liabilities and obligation under the supply and offtake agreement with J. Aron. Additionally partially offsetting the increase, net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 included a non-cash benefit of deferred income taxes of $26.8 million compared to expense of $48.0 million in the prior year.\nWe recognized income from equity method investments of $12.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to loss of $43.4 million for 2016. Changes in the results from equity method investments for 2017 and 2016 were primarily driven by the following:\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average prices of WTI Midland crude oil for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite life intangibles are evaluated for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. Accounting standards require that if an impairment indicator is present, we must assess whether the carrying amount of the asset is unrecoverable by estimating the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from the asset, undiscounted and without interest charges. We derive the required undiscounted cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our internal business plans. We use quoted market prices when available and our internal cash flow estimates discounted at an appropriate interest rate to determine fair value, as appropriate. If the carrying amount is more than the recoverable amount, an impairment charge must be recognized based on the fair value of the asset. We recognized an impairment charge of $2.7 million in 2016 related to the write-down of certain idle refining equipment in our refining segment to net realizable value. This impairment charge is included in other operating income in our consolidated statement of income for the period. There were no such impairment charges in 2018 and 2017.\n \u2022 the cost of materials and other benefit attributable to the RIN waivers. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOther Operating (Income) Expense, Net\nNet Revenues\nCost of Materials and Other\n2017 vs. 2016\nMarch 2018 RINs Waivers\n IV. Identify and manage risks to improve decision making and increase profitability, and \n \u2022 the absence of the equity method investment in Alon during the year ended December 31, 2018 whereas we recognized our proportionate share of the net income from our investment in Alon of $4.5 million, net of $1.3 million in amortization of the excess of our investment over our equity in the underlying net assets of Alon, for the year ended December 31, 2017; and \n \u2022 growing our business through new lines of business and investment in our existing businesses including capital improvements and new technology, and \nDepreciation and amortization (included in both cost of sales and other operating expenses) was $199.4 million and $153.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $46.1 million, or 30.1%. The increase in depreciation expense was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 the effects of increases in the price of finished petroleum products at our refineries (including a 18.0% increase in average price of CBOB gasoline per gallon and a 26.3% increase in average price of ULSD per gallon).  2017 vs. 2016\nRefining margin increased by $562.1 million or 73.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, with a refining margin percentage of 13.8% as compared to 11.6% for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, primarily driven by the following:\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nAll forward-looking statements included in this report are based on information available to us on the date of this report. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\n \u2022 For our Big Spring refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread. The Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread is calculated assuming that one barrel of WTI Cushing crude oil are converted into two-thirds barrel of Gulf Coast conventional gasoline and one-third barrel of Gulf Coast ultra-low sulfur diesel. Our Big Spring refinery is capable of processing substantial volumes of sour crude oil, which has historically cost less than intermediate, and/or substantial volumes of sweet crude oils, and therefore the WTI Cushing/WTS price differential, taking into account differences in production yield, is an important measure for helping us make strategic, market-respondent production decisions. \nOther operating expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $1.0 million and $4.8 million, respectively, primarily related to losses on asset disposals.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 increases in our debt levels or costs; \n2018 vs. 2017\n \u2022 the addition of Alon financial results as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed net sales of $1,906.4 during the year ended December 31, 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger); \nYTD 2018 vs. YTD 2017\nFebruary 2018 Acquisition of Non-controlling Interest in Alon Partnership\n \u2022 an increase to our effective tax rate to a more normalized level (in relation to statutory tax rates) where the 2017 tax rate was favorably and significantly impacted by the $166.9 million benefit attributable to the impact of applying the Tax Reform Act to our existing net deferred tax liabilities in 2017.  2017 vs. 2016\nForward-Looking Statements\n \u2022 higher operating costs associated with the logistics assets acquired in the Big Spring Logistic Assets Acquisition, including maintenance expenses, allocated employee costs, variable expenses such as utilities, and professional services fees incurred in connection with the transaction, which accounted for the majority of the increase in operating increases; \nGoodwill in an acquisition represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets. Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist, such as disruptions in our business, unexpected significant declines in operating results or a sustained market capitalization decline. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, If a reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value (Step 1), the impairment assessment leads to the testing of the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill to its carrying amount (Step 2). If the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount, a goodwill impairment charge is recorded. Subsequent to adoption of ASU 2017-04 (which we adopted during the fourth quarter of 2018, as permitted by the ASU), Step 2 is no longer required, but rather any impairment is determined based on the results of Step 1.\nOur refining segment has multiple service agreements with our logistics segment, which, among other things, require the refining segment to pay terminalling and storage fees based on the throughput volume of crude and finished product in the logistics segment pipelines and the volume of crude and finished product stored in the logistics segment storage tanks, subject to certain minimum volume commitments. These fees were $200.4 million, $129.6 million and $123.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We eliminate these intercompany fees in consolidation.\n \u2022 seasonality; \nOur corporate activities, results of certain immaterial operating segments (including our asphalt terminal operations effective with the Delek/ Alon Merger), our non-controlling equity interest of approximately 47% of the outstanding shares in Alon (which was accounted for as an equity method investment) prior to the Delek/Alon Merger, results and assets of discontinued operations and intercompany eliminations are reported in the corporate, other and eliminations segment.\n(2) Throughputs for the year ended December 31, 2018 are for the 306 days we marketed certain finished products produced at or sold from the Big Spring Refinery following execution of the Big Spring Marketing Agreement, effective March 1, 2018, as defined in Note 6 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 addition of Alon property, plant and equipment of $1,130.5 million (at preliminary fair value) and amortizable intangibles of $53.6 million (at preliminary fair value) as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger, which contributed $34.4 million in additional depreciation and amortization during 2017 (related to the six months since the date of the Delek/Alon Merger). \n \u2022 improvements in crude oil differentials as described above; and \nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 changes in interpretations, assumptions and expectations regarding the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including additional guidance that may be issued by federal and state taxing authorities; \nOther Non-Operating Expenses, Net\nOur annual assessment of goodwill did not result in impairment during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 or 2016. Details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIncome tax expense (benefit) was $101.9 million and $(29.2) million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase in expense of $131.1 million. The increase in expense was primarily driven by the following:\nThe Refinancing consolidated many of our facilities providing not only a more simplified borrowing structure but also expanding our borrowing capacity with interest rates that reflect our strengthened financial position and broadened asset base. Additionally, our covenant requirements under the Refinancing arrangements are less complex and therefore better allow us to manage our covenant compliance risk.\nThe market price of refined products contributed to the increase in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread to $13.21 in 2018 from $13.01 in 2017, with the Gulf Coast price of gasoline (CBOB) increasing 18.0%, from an average of $1.55 per gallon in 2017 to $1.83 per gallon in 2018. The Gulf Coast price of High Sulfur Diesel increased 30.8%, from an average of $1.47 per gallon in 2017 to $1.92 per gallon in 2018. The Gulf Coast price of Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel increased 26.3% from an average of $1.62 per gallon in 2017 to $2.05 per gallon in 2018. The charts below illustrate the quarterly high, low and average prices of Gulf Coast Gasoline, U.S. High Sulfur Diesel and U.S. Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel over the past three years.\nThe cost to acquire the refined fuel products we sell to our wholesale customers in our logistics segment and at our convenience stores in our retail segment depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, gasoline and other refined petroleum products which, in turn, depend on, among other factors, changes in domestic and foreign economies, weather conditions, domestic and foreign political affairs, production levels, the availability of imports, the marketing of competitive fuels and government regulation. Our retail merchandise sales are driven by convenience, customer service, competitive pricing and branding. Motor fuel margin is sales less the delivered cost of fuel and motor fuel taxes, measured on a cents per gallon basis. Our motor fuel margins are impacted by local supply, demand, weather, competitor pricing and product brand.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThe improvement in contribution margin percentage is also attributable to increased efficiencies and optimization of store operations during the period since the stores were acquired.\nCost of materials and other increased $2,427.7 million, or 41.5% in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the following:\n V. Significantly increase overall earnings.  These overarching objectives are supported by five strategic focuses, which inform the priorities of each segment's initiatives, as discussed below:\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements through the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThese increases were partially offset by the following:\nResults of Operations\nDisclosures, Financial Statements, and Changes in Disagreements\n2017 vs. 2016\n2018 vs. 2017\nSummary Financial and Other Information\n2018 Disposal of California Discontinued Entities\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about our credit facilities.\n \u2022 Optimization of our refining system. We have doubled the size of our refining system since 2016. This gives us the opportunities to utilize the best practices from each location to improve reliability, efficiencies and yields in an effort to maximize performance. This should enhance our competitive position and free cash flow potential. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\n \u2022 Maintain and continue to enhance our safe operations. As we invest in and grow our business, we remain focused on safe and compliant operations for the benefit of our employees, communities, customers and shareholders. \n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results; and \n\nDuring 2018, Delek's leadership team built a new framework to facilitate development of the Company's strategies and initiatives. This framework starts with the Company's overarching objectives for the next five years:\nLogistics Segment\nOperating Expenses\nWe consistently seek out regulatory and operational opportunities to minimize costs and thereby maximize the return on our refining assets. In March 2018, the El Dorado and Krotz Springs refineries both received approval from the EPA for a small refinery exemption from the requirements of the renewable fuel standard for the 2017 calendar year, which resulted in a reduction of our RINs Obligation (as defined in Note 13 to our accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements) and related cost of materials and other of approximately $59.3 million and $31.6 million for the El Dorado and Krotz Springs refineries, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n2018 vs. 2017\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 a net increase of 8.0 million gallons in the volume of gasoline and diesel purchased in west Texas during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to gallons purchased during the year ended December 31, 2016. \nThe Retail Segment was not reported for the year ended December 31, 2016 and for periods in 2017 prior to July 1, 2017 (the date of the Delek/Alon Merger), as our previous Retail Entities were discontinued, and the new Retail Segment was not acquired until July 1, 2017. The table below sets forth certain information concerning our retail segment operations ($ in millions):\nThe transaction to dispose of certain assets and liabilities associated with our Long Beach, California refinery to Bridge Point Long Beach, LLC, closed July 17, 2018 resulting in initial cash proceeds of approximately $14.5 million, net of expenses. See further discussion in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n (5) For our Tyler and El Dorado refineries, we compare our per barrel refining product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread consisting of WTI Cushing crude, U.S. Gulf Coast CBOB and U.S, Gulf Coast Pipeline No. 2 heating oil (high sulfur diesel). For our Big Spring refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 3-2-1 crack spread consisting of WTI Cushing crude, Gulf Coast 87 Conventional gasoline and Gulf Coast ultra low sulfur diesel, and for our Krotz Springs refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 2-1-1 crack spread consisting of LLS crude oil, Gulf Coast 87 Conventional gasoline and U.S, Gulf Coast Pipeline No. 2 heating oil (high sulfur diesel). The Tyler refinery's crude oil input is primarily WTI Midland and east Texas, while the El Dorado refinery's crude input is primarily combination of WTI Midland, local Arkansas and other domestic inland crude oil. The Big Spring refinery's crude oil input is primarily comprised of WTS and WTI Midland. The Krotz Springs refinery's crude oil input is primarily comprised of LLS and WTI Midland. The Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries were acquired July 1, 2017 as part of the Delek/Alon Merger, so Gulf Coast 3-2-1 and 2-1-1 crack spreads, LLS and WTS statistics are presented only for the period Delek owned these refineries. \n \u2022 the addition of 302 convenience stores on July 1, 2017 in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger, where 2018 has twelve months of retail operating results and 2017 has only six months of retail operating results; and \nContribution Margin\n \u2022 The crude oil and product slate flexibility of the El Dorado refinery allows us to take advantage of changes in the crude oil and product markets; therefore, we anticipate that the quantities and varieties of crude oil processed and products manufactured at the El Dorado refinery by processing a variety of feedstocks into a number of refined product types will continue to vary. While there is variability in the crude slate and the product output at the El Dorado refinery, we compare our per barrel refined product margin to the Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread because we believe it to be the most closely aligned benchmark.  A widening of the WTI Cushing less WTI Midland spread will favorably influence the operating margin for our refineries. Alternatively, a narrowing of this differential will have an adverse effect on our operating margins. Global product prices are influenced by the price of Brent crude which is a global benchmark crude. Global product prices influence product prices in the U.S. As a result, our refineries are influenced by the spread between Brent crude and WTI Midland. The Brent less WTI Midland spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of WTI Cushing crude oil. A widening of the spread between Brent and WTI Cushing will favorably influence our refineries' operating margins. Also, the Krotz Springs refinery is influenced by the spread between Brent crude and LLS. The Brent less LLS spread represents the differential between the average per barrel price of Brent crude oil and the average per barrel price of LLS crude oil. A discount in LLS relative to Brent will favorably influence the Krotz Springs refinery operating margin.\nOperating expenses increased $105.3 million, or 49.6% in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger in the second half of 2017; \n \u2022 a reduction in cost of materials and other attributable to RIN waiver received which resulted in an incremental net reduction of such costs as compared to the prior year. \nConsolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $374.9 million compared to $322.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Consolidated net income attributable to Delek for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $340.1 million, or $4.11 per basic share, compared to $288.8 million, or $4.04 per basic share, for the year ended December 31, 2017. Explanations for significant drivers impacting net income as compared to the comparable period of the prior year are discussed in the sections below.\n IV. Risk-based decision making. Making effective and insightful decisions in a rapidly changing environment is a hallmark of high-performing organizations that sustain through volatile times. We are working to develop mitigation plans for defined operational and business unit risks that will be anticipatory and preemptive. \nEffective December 21, 2018, we amended our Big Spring refinery's Supply and Offtake Agreement with J. Aron so that the repurchase of baseline volumes at the end of the Supply and Offtake Agreement term (representing the \"Baseline Step-Out Liability\") will be based upon a fixed price instead of a market-indexed price. The modified arrangement results in a Baseline Step-Out Liability that is no longer subject to commodity volatility, but for which its fair value is subject to interest rate risk. As a result, we recorded a gain on the change in fair value resulting from the modification of the instruments from commodities-based risk to interest rate risk in cost of materials and other totaling approximately $4.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the Baseline Step-Out Liability under the Big Spring refinery's Supply and Offtake Agreement represents the fixed notional amount outstanding under the Supply and Offtake Agreement of $52.0 million less the unamortized discount of $2.4 million for a fair value of $49.6 million related to 0.8 million barrels of baseline consigned inventory, and is reflected as a non-current obligation on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018. Such Baseline Step-Out Liabilities will continue to be recorded at fair value, where the fair value will reflect changes in interest rate risk rather than commodity price risk. See further discussion in Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe table below reflects the quarterly high, low and average prices of WTI Cushing crude oil for each of the quarterly periods over the past three years.\nDepreciation and amortization was $153.3 million and $116.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, an increase of $36.9 million, or 31.7%. The increase was primarily driven by the following:\n \u2022 our ability to execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions and capital projects and changes in the expected value of and benefits derived therefrom, including any inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, realize expected synergies or achieve operational efficiency and effectiveness; \nAccounting Standards\n \u2022 business interruption insurance proceeds of $42.4 million associated with a settlement of litigation received in the first quarter of 2016. \n \u2022 the addition of the Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries in connection with the Delek/Alon Merger on July 1, 2017; \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nThese significant developments were intentionally implemented to align with some of our most critical strategic initiatives for both 2018 and 2019 which include managing our risk and enhancing shareholder value by focusing on the following:\nIn November 2018, Delek entered into Warrant Unwind Agreements (the \"Unwind Agreement\") with the holders of our outstanding common stock Warrants (as defined in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K). Pursuant to the terms of the Unwind Agreements, we settled for cash all outstanding Warrants with the holders at various prices per Warrant as provided in the Unwind Agreements. The settlement amount was based on the volume-weighted average market price of our common stock taking into account an adjustment for the exercise price of the Warrants over a period of sixteen trading days beginning November 9, 2018 (the Unwind Period\u201d). Following the Unwind Period and upon the satisfaction of the payment obligation, the Warrants were canceled and the associated rights and obligations terminated. Based on the provisions of the Unwind Agreement, the amount paid to warrant holders in satisfaction of the payment obligation totaled approximately $36 million. See further discussion in Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nService Agreements\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\n2018 vs. 2017\nDecember 31, 2021 or the date upon which our last 7-Eleven store is de-identified or closed. Merchandise sales at our convenience store sites will continue to be sold under the 7-Eleven brand name until 7-Eleven branding is removed pursuant to the termination.\n(3) Statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2017 reflects six months of incremental results of operations resulting from the Delek/Alon Merger, which was effective July 1, 2017. Additionally, the balance sheet date as of December 31, 2017 reflects the assets and liabilities of Alon as a result of the Delek/Alon Merger.\n \u2022 the recognition of our proportionate share of net income for equity method investments acquired in the Delek/Alon Merger. \n \u2022 Build on a winning culture. During 2017 and 2018, we believe our team responded well to our larger scale, as steps were taken to integrate the two companies following the acquisition of Alon in July 2017. We are now a larger and more diverse company, but our focus is to foster a culture that has the ability to act quickly in a changing environment to take advantage of opportunities. In order to support this operation, we continue to be focused on expanding our team, developing systems and providing the resources to position the organization for success in the future. \nManagement's Discussion and Analysis\nOn May 21, 2018, we sold certain assets and operations of four asphalt terminals (included in Delek's corporate/other segment), as well as an equity method investment in an additional asphalt terminal, to an affiliate of Andeavor. This transaction includes asphalt terminal assets in Bakersfield, Mojave and Elk Grove, California and Phoenix, Arizona, as well as Delek's 50% equity interest in the Paramount-Nevada Asphalt Company, LLC joint venture that operates an asphalt terminal located in Fernley, Nevada. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of approximately $110.8 million, inclusive of the $75.0 million base proceeds as well as certain preliminary working capital adjustments. The assets associated with the owned terminals met the definition of held for sale pursuant to Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 360, Property, Plant and Equipment (\"ASC 360\") as of February 1, 2018, but did not meet the definition of discontinued operations pursuant to ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations (\"ASC 205-20\") as the sale of these asphalt assets does not represent a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the entity's operations and financial results. Accordingly, depreciation ceased as of February 1, 2018, and the associated assets to be sold were reclassified to assets held for sale as of that date and were written down to the estimated fair value less costs to sell, resulting in an impairment loss on assets held for sale of $27.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. In connection with the completion of the sale transaction, we recognized a gain of approximately $13.3 million in results of continuing operations on the accompanying consolidated income statement. See further discussion in Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n \u2022 a 41.6% improvement in the average Gulf Coast 5-3-2 crack spread in 2017 as compared to 2016, which favorably impacted the period-over- period margins at all refineries; and \n \u2022 increases in the price of U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline, ULSD and HSD. \nof the volatility of the market in terms of pricing and availability, it is possible that we may have material positions with timing differences or, more rarely, that we are unable to cover a position with an offsetting position as intended. Such differences could have a material impact on the classification of resulting gains/losses, assets or liabilities, and could also significantly impact net earnings.\n2018 vs. 2017\nThe Tyler refinery's inventory consists of crude oil, refined petroleum products and blendstocks which are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined under the last-in, first-out LIFO valuation method. The LIFO method requires management to make estimates on an interim basis of the anticipated year-end inventory quantities, which could differ from actual quantities.\nChanges in laws and regulations and actual remediation expenses compared to historical experience could significantly impact our results of operations and financial position. We believe the estimates selected, in each instance, represent our best estimate of future outcomes, but the actual outcomes could differ from the estimates selected.\nMarch 2018 Transaction with Delek Logistics\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \u2022 volatility under our derivative instruments; \n2018 vs. 2017\nWe generated net revenues of $10,233.1 million and $7,267.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, an increase of $2,966.0 million, or 40.8%. The increase in net revenues was primarily due to the following factors:\nOn March 16, 2018, Delek sold to World Energy, LLC (i) all of Delek's membership interests in AltAir (ii) certain refining assets and other related assets located in Paramount, California and (iii) certain associated tank farm and pipeline assets and other related assets located in California. Upon final settlement, Delek expects to receive net cash proceeds of approximately $85.2 million, subject to a post-closing working capital settlement, Delek's portion of the expected biodiesel tax credit for 2017 and certain customary adjustments. The sale resulted in a loss on sale of discontinued operations totaling approximately $41.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. Of the total expected proceeds, $70.4 million was received in March 2018 ($14.9 million of which were included in net cash flows from investing activities in discontinued operations), with the remainder expected to be collected upon final settlement. In connection with the sale, the remaining assets and liabilities associated with the sold operations that were not included in the assets and liabilities acquired/assumed by the buyer were reclassified into assets and liabilities held and used (relating to continuing operations) and are presented as such in our December 31, 2018 balance sheet.\n(2) Statement of operations data for the year ended December 31, 2018 includes a $60.7 adjustment to increase net revenues and cost of materials and other to record a correction of an intercompany elimination that was not reflected in the February 20, 2019 Earnings Release. Such amounts are not considered material to the financial statements and had no impact to operating income, segment contribution margin or net income.\nOperating Expenses\n \u2022 changes in, or the failure to comply with, the extensive government regulations applicable to our industry segments; \nto owned interest was recorded at carrying value and no gain or loss was recognized in connection with the transaction.
