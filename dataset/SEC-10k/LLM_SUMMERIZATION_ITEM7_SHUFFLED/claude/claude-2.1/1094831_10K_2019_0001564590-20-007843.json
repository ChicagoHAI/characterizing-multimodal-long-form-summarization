This discussion is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\nWe are a leading global brokerage and financial technology company servicing the global financial markets.\nThrough brands including BGC\u00ae, GFI\u00ae, Sunrise\u2122, Besso\u2122, Ed Broking\u00ae, Poten & Partners\u2122 and RP Martin\u2122, among others, our businesses specialize in the brokerage of a broad range of products, including fixed income such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments, as well as related interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives. We also broker products across FX, equities, energy and commodities, insurance, and futures. Our businesses also provide a wide variety of services, including trade execution, brokerage services, clearing, trade compression, post-trade, information, and other back-office services to a broad assortment of financial and non-financial institutions. Our integrated platform is designed to provide flexibility to customers with regard to price discovery, execution and processing of transactions, and enables them to use Voice, Hybrid, or in many markets, Fully Electronic brokerage services in connection with transactions executed either OTC or through an exchange. Through our Fenics\u00ae group of electronic brands, we offer a number of market infrastructure and connectivity services, Fully Electronic marketplaces, and the Fully Electronic brokerage of certain products that also may trade via Voice and Hybrid execution. The full suite of Fenics\u00ae offerings include market data and related information services, Fully Electronic brokerage, compression and other post-trade services, analytics related to financial instruments and markets, and other financial technology solutions. Fenics\u00ae brands operate under the names Fenics\u00ae, BGC Trader\u2122, CreditMatch\u00ae, Fenics MD\u2122, BGC Market Data\u2122, kACE2\u00ae, EMBonds\u00ae, Capitalab\u00ae, Swaptioniser\u00ae, CBID\u00ae and Lucera\u00ae.\nWe previously offered real estate services through our publicly traded subsidiary, Newmark (NASDAQ: NMRK). On November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of Newmark (see Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off\u201d for more information).\nBGC, BGC Partners, BGC Trader, GFI, GFI Ginga, CreditMatch, Fenics, Fenics.com, Sunrise Brokers, Besso, Ed Broking, Poten & Partners, RP Martin, kACE2, EMBonds, Capitalab, Swaptioniser, CBID and Lucera are trademarks/service marks, and/or registered trademarks/service marks of BGC Partners, Inc. and/or its affiliates.\nOur customers include many of the world's largest banks, broker-dealers, investment banks, trading firms, hedge funds, governments, corporations, and investment firms. We have dozens of offices globally in major markets including New York and London, as well as in Bahrain, Beijing, Bermuda, Bogot\u00e1, Brisbane, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Copenhagen, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt, Geneva, Hong Kong, Houston, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Madrid, Melbourne, Mexico City, Moscow, Nyon, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, S\u00e3o Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and Toronto.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had over 2,900 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel across our businesses.\nNewmark IPO, Separation and Spin-Off\nOn December 13, 2017, prior to the Newmark IPO, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities relating to our Real Estate Services business to Newmark. In connection with the Separation, Newmark assumed certain indebtedness and made a proportional distribution of interests in Newmark Holdings to holders of interests in BGC Holdings.\nIn December 2017, Newmark completed its IPO of an aggregate of 23 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock. Prior to the Newmark IPO, Newmark was our wholly owned subsidiary.\nOn November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of the shares of Newmark Class A and Class B common stock held by us to our stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date through a special pro-rata stock dividend pursuant to which shares of Newmark Class A common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of BGC Class A common stock and shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of BGC Class B common stock (which holders of BGC Class B common stock were Cantor and another entity controlled by our CEO, Howard W. Lutnick). Following the Spin-Off, BGC no longer holds any shares of Newmark.\nFor more information about these transactions, see Note 1- Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGFI Merger\nOn January 12, 2016, we completed our acquisition of GFI, a leading intermediary and provider of trading technologies and support services to the global OTC and listed markets, via the GFI Merger. GFI serves institutional clients in operating electronic and hybrid markets for cash and derivative products across multiple asset classes.\nNasdaq Transaction\nOn June 28, 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets to Nasdaq, which purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the Fully Electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses, for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of Nasdaq is equal to or greater than $25 million. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company transferred the right to receive earn-out payments from Nasdaq to Newmark. Following the Spin-Off, the right to receive earn-out payments from Nasdaq remains with Newmark.\nAs a result of the sale of eSpeed, we only sold our on-the-run benchmark 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year Fully Electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds. We continue to offer Voice brokerage for on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, as well as across various other products in rates, credit, FX, market data and software solutions. As we continue to focus our efforts on converting Voice and Hybrid desks to Fully Electronic execution, our e-businesses and revenues from inter-company data, software, and post-trade services, have continued to grow their revenues.\nGoing forward, we expect these businesses to become an even more valuable part of BGC as they continue to grow.\nFully Electronic (Fenics) and Hybrid Execution\nFor the purposes of this document and subsequent SEC filings, all of our Fully Electronic businesses are referred to as Fenics. The Fenics business includes our group of electronic brands offering a number of market infrastructure and connectivity services, Fully Electronic marketplaces, and the Fully Electronic brokerage of certain products that also may trade via Voice and Hybrid execution. The full suite of Fenics offerings include market data and related information services, Fully Electronic brokerage, compression and other post-trade services, analytics related to financial instruments and markets, and other financial technology solutions.\nHistorically, our technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale financial intermediaries alike, even if overall Company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because automated and electronic trading efficiency allows the same number of employees to manage a greater volume of trades as the marginal cost of incremental trading activity falls. Over time, the conversion of exchange-traded and OTC markets to Fully Electronic trading has also led, on average, to volumes increasing by enough to offset commission declines, and thus often to similar or higher overall revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution, and we continually work with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies.\nOutside of U.S. Treasuries and spot FX, the banks and financial firms that dominate the OTC markets had, until recent years, generally been hesitant in adopting electronically traded products. However, the banks, broker-dealers, and other professional trading firms are now much more active in Hybrid and Fully Electronically traded markets across various OTC products, including credit derivative indices, FX derivatives, non-U.S. sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and interest rate derivatives. These electronic markets have grown as a percentage of overall industry volumes for the past few years as firms like BGC have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers. Regulation in Asia, Europe and the U.S. regarding banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives has accelerated the adoption of Fully Electronic execution, and we expect this to continue. We also believe that new clients, beyond our large bank customer base, will primarily transact electronically across our Fenics platform.\nThe combination of more market acceptance of Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution and our competitive advantage in terms of technology and experience has contributed to our strong gains in electronically traded products. We continue to invest in Hybrid and Fully Electronic technology broadly across our product categories, not only launching existing product pools but also launching new platforms with market leading protocols and functionality, which we believe will be game changing in the sector. Fenics has exhibited strong growth over the past several years, and we believe that this growth has outpaced the wholesale brokerage industry as a whole. We expect this trend to accelerate as we convert more of our Voice and Hybrid brokerage into Fully Electronic brokerage across our Fenics platform.\nWe expect to benefit from the secular trend towards electronic trading, increased demand for market data, and the need for increased automation and post-trade services. We continue to onboard new customers as the opportunities created by electronic and algorithmic trading continue to transform our industry. We continue to roll out our next-gen Fenics brokerage platforms across more products and geographies with the goal of seamlessly integrating Voice liquidity with customer electronic orders either by a graphical user interface or application programming interface, and we expect to have continued success converting Voice/Hybrid desks over time as we roll out these platforms across more products and geographies.\nWe have continued to invest in our new Fenics stand-alone Fully Electronic offerings, which currently include:\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fenics GO, our new electronic trading platform, which provides live, real-time and tradeable two-way electronic liquidity for exchange-listed futures and options, such as Eurex EURO STOXX 50 Index Options, NIKKEI 225, and related Delta One strategies.

This compares with a decline of 18% for overall primary dealer U.S. Treasury volumes. Primary dealer volumes are based on data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Over the same timeframe, Fenics UST increased its market share of CLOB trading from approximately 2% to nearly 10% and is now the second largest CLOB platform for U.S. Treasuries. CLOB market share is based on data from Greenwich Associates for the U.S. Treasury volumes of Fenics UST, CME BrokerTec, Nasdaq Fixed Income, and Dealerweb. Including these CLOB platforms as well as the volumes of platforms using other fully electronic U.S. Treasury trading protocols, Fenics UST increased its market share from 1.3% to 5.4% year-on-year in December 2019, per Greenwich Associates.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Our expanded Fenics FX platforms, including MidFX, Spot, FX Options, and non-deliverable and FX forwards;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 232: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Lucera, which is our software-defined network, offering the trading community direct connectivity to each other; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 233: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Capitalab's Nikkei 225 options compression service, which is in partnership with the Singapore Exchange.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollectively, our newer Fenics offerings, such as the five listed above, are not yet fully up to scale, and are not yet generating significant revenues. The net loss relating to investment in these new products and services was more than $55 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect the net loss relating to these investments in Fenics offerings to improve by $15 million in 2020 and for the net loss to be approximately $40 million, and for these newer businesses to break even during 2021. Over time, we expect these new products and services to become profitable, high-margin businesses as their scale and revenues increase, all else equal. We believe that our newer Fenics offerings have created significant shareholder value.\nAs we continue to focus our efforts on converting Voice and Hybrid desks to Fully Electronic execution, net revenues in our higher margin Fully Electronic businesses across brokerage, data, software, and post-trade increased 12.2% to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Going forward, we expect Fenics to become an even more valuable part of BGC as it continues to grow. We continue to analyze how to optimally configure our Voice/Hybrid and Fully Electronic businesses.\nPossible Restructuring\nBefore our first quarter 2020 earnings call, we expect to submit a proposal to the Board and relevant committees with respect to converting our partnership into a corporation. Our current target is to be positioned to begin executing a conversion around the end of the third quarter of 2020, and expect to complete the execution around year end 2020. Any such restructuring would be subject to tax, accounting, regulatory, and other considerations and approvals.\nImpact of ASC 606 on Results\nFrom 2014 through 2016, the FASB issued several accounting standard updates, which together comprise ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company began recording its financial results to conform to ASC 606. ASC 606 does not currently materially impact the results of BGC. The consolidated Company has elected to adopt the guidance using the modified retrospective approach to ASC 606, under which the consolidated Company applied the new standard only to new contracts initiated on or after January 1, 2018 and recorded the transition adjustments as part of Total equity\u201d.\nFinancial Services Industry\nThe financial services industry has grown historically due to several factors. One factor was the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in the value of FX, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors and changes in the prices of commodity products. Over this same timeframe, demand from financial institutions, financial services intermediaries and large corporations have increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business opportunity for financial intermediaries.\nAnother key factor in the historical growth of the financial services industry has been the increase in the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most of these new securities and derivatives were not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increased the need for trading and required broker-assisted execution.\nDue largely to the impacts of the global financial crises of 2008-2009, our businesses had faced more challenging market conditions from 2009 until the second half of 2016. Accommodative monetary policies were enacted by several major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, in response to the global financial crises. These policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across many of the financial markets in which we operate. The global credit markets also faced structural issues, such as increased bank capital requirements under Basel III. Consequently, these factors contributed to lower trading volumes in our rates and credit asset classes across most geographies in which we operated.\nSince mid-2016, the overall financial services industry has benefited from sustained economic growth, a lower unemployment rate, higher consumer spending, the modification or repeal of certain U.S. regulations, and higher investment income. In addition, the secular trend towards digitalization and electronification within the industry has contributed to higher overall volumes and transaction count in Fully Electronic execution. Looking ahead, concerns about the future trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU after Brexit, a slowdown in global growth driven by the outbreak of coronavirus in China, and an increase in trade protectionism are tempered by expectations of monetary and fiscal stimulus.\nBrexit\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding continued membership in the EU. The exit from the EU is commonly referred to as Brexit. The Brexit vote passed by 51.9% to 48.1%. The U.K. subsequently formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, but its relationship with the bloc will remain in a transition period until December 31, 2020. During this period, the U.K. will, with some exceptions, remain subject to EU law. It will also maintain access to the EU's single market. If both the U.K. and the EU agree, this transition period may be extended once by up to two years, meaning it could remain in place until December 31, 2022. Such an extension must, however, be agreed upon before July 1, 2020. The U.K. government has ruled out any extension to the transition period and has legislated for a commitment not to agree to any extension. The government would then only be able to reverse that provision through new legislation.\nThe U.K. and EU are currently negotiating a trade deal which, once signed, should determine the new bilateral trade relationship going forward. Given the short time period involved, it is not certain that such trade deal will be sufficiently comprehensive to encompass financial services. In case no new trade deal (or one incorporating financial services) is in place by the end of the transition period, absent mitigating legislative measures by individual EU member states, the trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU would be solely based on World Trade Organization terms. This could hinder current levels of mutual market access. While other trade deals are being considered, for example between the U.K. and the U.S., these may also prove challenging to negotiate and are unlikely to replace or compensate for a reduction, if any, in U.K. and EU trade at least in the short term. Further, the terms of a U.K. and EU trade deal may adversely impact the negotiation and terms of such other deals and vice versa.\nGiven the current uncertainty around the future trade relationship and/or the length of the transition period, the consequences for the economies of the U.K. and the EU member states as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU are unknown and unpredictable. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the broader macro-economic and financial implications the U.K. leaving the EU with no agreements in place would have.\nThis uncertainty could adversely impact investor confidence which could result in additional market volatility. Historically, elevated volatility has often led to increased volumes in the Financial Services markets in which we broker, which could be beneficial for our businesses. At other times, increased volatility has led to many market participants curtailing trading activity. Furthermore, any future trade deal might lead to a fragmented regulatory environment, which could increase the costs of our operations and loss of existing levels of cross-border market access. While we have implemented plans to ensure continuity of service in Europe and continue to have regulated entities and offices in place in many of the major European markets in order to mitigate certain risks and uncertainties created by political negotiations between the U.K. and EU, these and other risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our customers, counterparties, businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nRegulation\nSee Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nIndustry Consolidation\nIn recent years, there has been significant consolidation among the interdealer-brokers and wholesale brokers with which we compete. In addition to our 2015 acquisition of GFI, Tullett and ICAP announced in November 2015 an agreement whereby Tullett would purchase the vast majority of ICAP's global Voice/Hybrid broking, as well as portions of its information businesses. Following the completion of this deal in December 2016, ICAP changed its corporate name to NEX, and Tullett changed its name to TP ICAP plc. CME announced in March 2018 that it had agreed to acquire NEX and completed the acquisition in November 2018. We expect to continue to compete with the electronic markets, post-trade and information businesses of NEX, that are part of CME now, through the various offerings on our Fenics platform. We will also continue to compete with TP ICAP across various Voice/Hybrid brokerage marketplaces as well as via Fenics. There has also been significant consolidation among smaller non-public wholesale brokers, including our acquisitions of RP Martin, Heat Energy Group, Remate Lince and Sunrise Brokers Group. We view the recent consolidation in the industry favorably, as we expect it to provide additional operating leverage to our businesses in the future.\nGrowth Drivers\nAs a wholesale intermediary in the financial services industry, our businesses are driven primarily by overall industry volumes in the markets in which we broker, the size and productivity of our front-office headcount (including brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel), regulatory issues, and the percentage of our revenues we are able to generate by Fully Electronic means.\nBelow is a brief analysis of the market and industry volumes for some of our products, including our overall Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution activities.\nOverall Market Volumes and Volatility\nVolume is driven by a number of factors, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, price volatility of financial instruments, macro-economic conditions, creation and adoption of new products, regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. Historically, increased price volatility has often increased the demand for hedging instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker.\nRates volumes in particular are influenced by market volumes and, in certain instances, volatility. Historically low and negative interest rates across the globe have significantly reduced the overall trading appetite for rates products. As a result of central bank policies and actions, as well as continued expectations of low inflation rates, many sovereign bonds continue to trade at or close to negative yields, especially in real terms. In addition, also weighing on yields and rates volumes are global central bank quantitative easing programs. The programs depress rates volumes because they entail central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open market - particularly longer-dated instruments - in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge, thus lowering rates volumes across cash and derivatives markets industry-wide. Major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, and Swiss National Bank continue to maintain historically low interest rates through quantitative easing programs, keeping key short-term interest rates low, or a combination of both. Even with the Federal Reserve unwind, the overall dollar value of balance sheets of the G-4 (the U.S., Eurozone, Japan, and U.K.) is expected to remain high as a percentage of G-4 GDP over the near term. Largely as a result of quantitative easing and expectations of continued low inflation, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was (0.19)% and the yield on Japan's 10-year bond was (0.02)% as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAdditional factors have weighed down market volumes in the products we broker. For example, the Basel III accord, implemented in late 2010 by the G-20 central banks, is a global regulatory framework on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk that was developed with the intention of making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis by increasing bank liquidity and reducing bank leverage. The accord, which is expected to be fully phased in as of January 1, 2022, has already required most large banks in G-20 nations to hold approximately three times as much Tier 1 capital as was required under the previous set of rules. These capital rules have made it more expensive for banks to hold non-sovereign debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say that banks have reduced their proprietary trading activity in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has further reduced overall market exposure and industry volumes in many of the products we broker, particularly in credit.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, industry volumes were generally mixed year-over-year across fixed income, and higher for commodities, while FX and equities industry volumes were generally lower. Below is an expanded discussion of the volume and growth drivers of our various brokerage product categories.\nRates Volumes and Volatility\nOur rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including global sovereign issuances, secondary trading and the hedging of these sovereign debt instruments. The amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains high by historical standards, and the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity was mixed during 2019. In addition, according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average daily volume of various U.S. Treasuries, excluding Treasury bills, among primary dealers was 7% higher in 2019 as compared to a year earlier. Additionally, interest rate derivative volumes were down 13% and up 4% at ICE and the CME, respectively, all according to company press releases. In comparison, our revenue from Fenics Fully Electronic rates increased 13.7%, while our overall rates revenues were up 8.2% as compared to a year earlier to $594.9 million.\nOur rates revenues, like the revenues for most of our products, are not fully dependent on market volumes and, therefore, do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This is largely because our Voice, Hybrid, and Fully Electronic desks in rates often have volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes.\nOverall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. Meanwhile, economists expect that the effects of various forms of quantitative easing undertaken by the various major central banks over the past several years will continue to negatively impact financial market volumes, as economic growth remains weak in most OECD countries. As a result, we expect long-term tailwinds in our rates business from continuing high levels of government debt, but continued near-term headwinds due to the current low interest rate environment and continued accommodative monetary policies globally.\nFX Volumes and Volatility\nGlobal FX volumes were generally lower during 2019. Spot FX volumes at CME, Refinitiv (formerly the Financial & Risk business of Thomson Reuters), and EBS (CME formerly NEX) were down 14%, flat, and down 17%, respectively. In comparison, our overall FX revenues decreased by 6.5% to $370.3 million.\nCredit Volumes\nThe cash portion of our credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance, while both the cash and credit derivatives sides of this business are impacted by sovereign and corporate issuance. The global credit derivative market turnover has declined over the last few years due to the introduction of rules and regulations around the clearing of credit derivatives in the U.S. and elsewhere, along with non-uniform regulation across different geographies. In addition, many of our large bank customers continue to reduce their inventory of bonds and other credit products in order to comply with Basel III and other international financial regulations. During 2019, primary dealer average daily volume for corporate bonds (excluding commercial paper) was up by 11% according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Total notional traded credit derivatives as reported by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association - a reflection of the OTC derivatives market - were down by 12%, from a year earlier. In comparison, our overall credit revenues were up by 5.0% to $306.7 million.\nEnergy and Commodities\nEnergy and commodities volumes were generally higher during 2019 compared with the year earlier. According to the Futures Industry Association, the total contracts traded in energy and commodities futures were up 14% in 2019 compared to the previous year. Similarly, total contracts traded in energy and commodities options were up 16% over the same period. In comparison, BGC's energy and commodities revenues increased by 25.6% to $286.6 million, which was driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, as well as organic growth, and partially offset by the sale of CSC.\nEquities, Insurance, and Other Asset Classes\nGlobal equity volumes were generally down during 2019. Research from Raymond James indicates that the average daily volumes of U.S. cash equities and U.S. options were down 4% and 5%, respectively, from a year ago. Over the same timeframe, average daily volumes of European cash equities were down 18% (in notional value), while Eurex average daily volumes of equity derivatives were up 4%. Our overall revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased by 14.3% to $409.2 million, which was driven by the acquisition of Ed Broking.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, insurance brokerage revenues increased by 185.6% and 126.0% to $43.3 million and $155.8 million, respectively. Including interest income, total revenues associated with insurance brokerage increased by 186.5% and 127.7% to $44.0 million and $158.0 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nOur overall insurance brokerage business now includes Ed Broking, as well as our newly acquired aviation and space insurance brokerage business, whose producers are not yet generating meaningful revenue. Therefore, these newer insurance businesses are not yet up to scale. The pre-tax loss relating to our insurance brokerage business was $9.7 million and $18.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The corresponding prior year periods had a pre-tax loss of $2.8 million and pre-tax income of $5.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nWe currently expect our overall insurance brokerage business to operate around breakeven for the next two years as we seek to double this division's current revenues. We also expect our overall investment to turn profitable and deliver margins in excess of 15% by 2022. This is similar to the trend in revenues and profitability of our former real estate services business, Newmark, over its first three years as part of BGC. We believe our insurance brokerage business is worth materially more than our investment and are actively considering ways to better express its value for the benefit of our investors.\nSummary of Results from Continuing Operations\nOur results from continuing operations exclude the results of Newmark for all periods due to the Spin-Off. During the year ended December 31, 2019, BGC's revenues increased 8.6%, to $2,104.2 million. This growth was largely due to an increase in brokerage revenues, which were up by 7.8% to $1,967.7 million. In addition, our data, software, and post-trade revenues increased by 12.2% from a year ago to $73.2 million. Income from operations before income taxes decreased by $41.7 million to $138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nRevenues\nOur revenues are derived primarily from brokerage commissions charged for either agency or matched principal transactions, fees from related parties, fees charged for market data, analytics and post-trade products, fees from software solutions, and interest income.\nBrokerage\nWe earn revenues from our brokerage services on both an agency and matched principal basis. In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. Principal transaction revenues are primarily derived from matched principal transactions, whereby revenues are earned on the spread between the buy and the sell price of the brokered security, commodity or derivative. Customers either see the buy or sell price on a screen or are given this information over the phone. The brokerage fee is then added to the buy or sell price, which represents the spread we earn as principal transactions revenues. On a limited basis, we enter into unmatched principal transactions to facilitate a customer's execution needs for transactions initiated by such customers. We also provide market data products for selected financial institutions.\nWe offer our brokerage services in seven broad product categories: rates, credit, FX, energy & commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes.

brokerage revenues. We expect that revenues from our rates product brokerage operations will increase in absolute terms, but decline as a percentage of our overall revenues as we continue to invest in expanding in other asset classes.\nOur position as a leading wholesale financial broker is enhanced by our Hybrid brokerage platform. We believe that the more complex, less liquid markets on which we focus often require significant amounts of personal and attentive service from our brokers. In more mature markets, we offer Fully Electronic execution capabilities to our customers through our platforms, including Fenics and BGC Trader. Our Hybrid platform allows our customers to trade on a Voice, Hybrid or, where available, Fully Electronic basis, regardless of whether the trade is OTC or exchange-based, and to benefit from the experience and market intelligence of our worldwide brokerage network. Our electronic capabilities include clearing, settlement, post-trade, and other back-office services as well as straight-through processing for our customers across several products. Furthermore, we benefit from the operational leverage in our Fully Electronic platform. We believe our Hybrid brokerage approach provides a competitive advantage over competitors who do not offer this full range of technology.\nRates\nOur rates business is focused on government debt, futures and currency, and both listed and OTC interest rate derivatives, which are among the largest, most global and most actively traded markets. The main drivers of these markets are global macroeconomic forces such as growth, inflation, government budget policies and new issuances.\nCredit\nWe provide our brokerage services in a wide range of credit instruments, including asset-backed securities, convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit derivatives and high yield bonds.\nFX\nThe FX market is one of the largest financial markets in the world. FX transactions can either be undertaken in the spot market, in which one currency is sold and another is bought, or in the derivative market in which future settlement of the identical underlying currencies are traded. We provide full execution OTC brokerage services in most major currencies, including all G8 currencies, emerging market, cross and exotic options currencies.\nEnergy and Commodities\nWe provide brokerage services for most widely traded energy and commodities products, including futures and OTC products covering, refined and crude oil, liquid natural gas, coal, electricity, gold and other precious metals, base metals, emissions, and soft commodities. We also provide brokerage services associated with the shipping of certain energy and commodities products.\nEquities, Insurance, and Other Asset Classes\nWe provide brokerage services in a range of markets for equity products, including cash equities, equity derivatives (both listed and OTC), equity index futures and options on equity products as well as insurance products.\nFees from Related Parties\nWe earn fees from related parties for technology services and software licenses and for certain administrative and back-office services we provide to affiliates, particularly from Cantor. These administrative and back-office services include office space, utilization of fixed assets, accounting services, operational support, human resources, legal services and information technology.\nData, software and post-trade\nFenics Market Data is a supplier of real-time, tradable, indicative, end-of-day and historical market data. Our market data product suite includes fixed income, interest rate derivatives, credit derivatives, FX, FX options, money markets, energy and equity derivatives and structured market data products and services. The data are sourced from the Voice, Hybrid and Fully Electronic broking operations, as well as the market data operations, including BGC, GFI and RP Martin, among others. It is made available to financial professionals, research analysts and other market participants via direct data feeds and BGC-hosted FTP environments, as well as via information vendors such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, ICE Data Services, QUICK Corp., and other select specialist vendors.\nThrough our software solutions business, we provide customized software to broaden distribution capabilities and provide electronic solutions to financial market participants. The software solutions business leverages our global infrastructure, software, systems, portfolio of intellectual property, and electronic trading expertise to provide customers with electronic marketplaces and exchanges and real-time auctions to enhance debt issuance and to customize trading interfaces. We take advantage of the scalability, flexibility and functionality of our electronic trading system to enable our customers to distribute products to their customers through online offerings and auctions, including private and reverse auctions, via our trading platform and global network. Using screen-based market solutions, customers are able to develop a marketplace, trade with their customers, issue debt, trade odd lots, access program trading interfaces and access our network and intellectual property. We provide option pricing and analysis tools that deliver price discovery that is supported with market data sourced from both our BGC and GFI trading systems.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Capitalab completed its largest G-4 Interest Rates IMO to date with more than 15 participating counterparties. The service enabled these counterparties to multilaterally shrink delta, vega and curvature bilateral counterparty risks and significantly reduce both non-cleared and cleared initial margin at the Central Clearing Counterparty. In January of 2018, Capitalab executed the first combined compression cycle in Swaptions, Caps, Floors and cleared interest rate swaps due to its appointment as an Approved Compression Service Provider at LCH's SwapClear. In the second quarter of 2019, Capitalab launched its Nikkei 225 options compression service in partnership with the Singapore Exchange.\nInterest Income\nWe generate interest income primarily from the investment of our daily cash balances, interest earned on securities owned and reverse repurchase agreements. These investments and transactions are generally short-term in nature. We also earn interest income from employee loans, and we earn dividend income on certain marketable securities.\nOther Revenues\nWe earn other revenues from various sources, including underwriting and advisory fees.\nExpenses\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nThe majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, broker bonuses based on broker production, guaranteed bonuses, other discretionary bonuses, and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of brokers, salespeople, executives and other administrative support. The majority of our brokers receive a base salary and a formula bonus based primarily on a pool of brokers' production for a particular product or sales desk, as well as on the individual broker's performance. Members of our sales force receive either a base salary or a draw on commissions. Less experienced salespeople typically receive base salaries and bonuses.\nAs part of our compensation plans, certain employees are granted LPUs in BGC Holdings which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, that are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such LPUs are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCertain of these LPUs entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d The liability for LPUs with a post-termination payout amount is included in Accrued compensation\u201d on our consolidated statements of financial condition.\nCertain LPUs are granted exchangeability into our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nIn addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain LPUs, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability or redemption in connection with the grant of shares of common stock to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange or redemption. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings are allocated to Preferred Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The Preferred Distribution is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership interests. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners, whereby these individuals receive loans which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their LPUs or may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan. From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements.\nIn addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. See Note 19- Compensation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Operating Expenses\nWe have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses for our businesses worldwide. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses for voice and data connections with our clients, clearing agents and general usage; professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects; and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings.\nPrimarily in the U.S., we pay fees to Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support services, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from Cantor in the future. We incur commissions and floor brokerage fees for clearing, brokerage and other transactional expenses for clearing and settlement services. We also incur various other normal operating expenses.\nOther Income (Losses), Net\nGain (Loss) on Divestiture and Sale of Investments\nGain (Loss) on divestiture and sale of investments represent the gain or loss we recognize for the divestiture or sale of our investments.\nGains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments\nGains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro-rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control.\nOther Income (Loss)\nOther Income (loss) is primarily comprised of gains or losses related to fair value adjustments on investments carried under the alternative method. Other Income (loss) also includes realized and unrealized gains or losses related to sales and mark-to-market adjustments on Marketable securities and any related hedging transactions when applicable. Acquisition-related fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and miscellaneous recoveries are also included in Other Income (loss).\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nWe incur income tax expenses or benefit based on the location, legal structure and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the UBT in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the partners (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d for discussion of partnership interests), rather than the partnership entity. The Company's consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes.\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\nSee Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nLIQUIDITY\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein for information related to our liquidity and capital resources.\nHIRING AND ACQUISITIONS\nKey drivers of our revenue are front-office producer headcount and average revenue per producer. We believe that our strong technology platform and unique partnership structure have enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to profitably increase our front-office staff at a faster rate than our largest competitors since our formation in 2004.\nWe have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business environment through acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed in the current business environment.\nOur average revenue per front-office employee has historically declined year-over-year for the period immediately following significant headcount increases, and the additional brokers and salespeople generally achieve significantly higher productivity levels in their second or third year with the Company. Excluding our insurance brokerage business, as of December 31, 2019, our front-office headcount was 2,570 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, up 1% from 2,553 a year ago. Compared to the prior year, average revenue per front-office employee for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 1% to $750 thousand from $760 thousand. On a stand-alone basis, our total insurance brokerage headcount increased by 122% to 591 from 266 a year ago.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our front-office headcount, including our insurance brokerage business, was 2,990 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, up 13% from 2,654 a year ago. Our total technology headcount increased by 8% year-on-year to 691, related primarily to our newer Fenics stand-alone Fully Electronic offerings. Compared to the prior year, average revenue per front-office employee, including our insurance brokerage business, for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 7% to $703 thousand from $756 thousand. All figures mentioned in the previous two paragraphs exclude Newmark.\nBecause revenue per broker is not a widely used or relevant statistic for the insurance brokerage industry, BGC will provide statistics with respect to front-office staff excluding this business beginning in the first quarter of 2020.\nThe laws and regulations passed or proposed on both sides of the Atlantic concerning OTC trading seem likely to favor increased use of technology by all market participants, and are likely to accelerate the adoption of both Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution. We believe these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, non-public local competitors, as the smaller players generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in technology. We believe this will lead to further consolidation across the wholesale financial brokerage industry, and thus allow us to profitably grow our front-office headcount.\nSince 2017, our acquisitions have included Besso, Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, Ginga Petroleum and several smaller acquisitions.\nOn January 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Micromega Securities, which operates in the South African fixed income, rates and FX markets.\nOn February 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Besso, an independent Lloyd's of London insurance broker with a strong reputation across property, casualty, marine, aviation, professional and financial risks and reinsurance.\nOn November 15, 2018, we acquired Poten & Partners, a leading ship brokerage, consulting and business intelligence firm specializing in LNG, tanker and LPG markets. Founded over 80 years ago and with 170 employees worldwide, Poten & Partners provides its clients with valuable insight into the international oil, gas and shipping markets.\nOn January 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Ed Broking, an independent Lloyd's of London insurance broker with a strong reputation across accident and health, aerospace, cargo, energy, financial and political risks, marine, professional and executive risks, property and casualty, specialty and reinsurance. Ed Broking has become part of the Company's overall insurance brokerage business.\nOn March 12, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Ginga Petroleum. Ginga Petroleum provides a comprehensive range of broking services for physical and derivative energy products, including naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, fuel oil, biofuels, middle distillates, petrochemicals and gasoline.\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we had income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $138.1 million compared to income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $179.8 million in the year earlier period. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $166.4 million to $2,104.2 million primarily led by our energy and commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes, rates, and credit businesses.\nBrokerage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $143.2 million. Our brokerage revenue growth was led by a 25.6% improvement in our energy and commodities business, which was driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, partially offset by the sale of CSC Commodities. Revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased 14.3% primarily due to the acquisition of Ed Broking. Our insurance brokerage revenues increased 126% for the full year 2019, largely due to the acquisition of Ed Broking. Because of the significant growth of this business, we expect to break out insurance brokerage revenues separately from equities and other asset classes in the next quarter. We believe our insurance brokerage business is worth materially more than our investment and are actively considering ways to better express its value for the benefit of our investors. Within our Fenics business, net revenues were up 6.4%. Our Fully Electronic brokerage revenues increased 4.4%, which was primarily led by a 13.7% increase in our Fenics rates business, while our revenues from our high margin data, software, and post-trade business increased 12.2%. As our stand-alone Fenics offerings continue to gain traction, we convert Voice and Hybrid revenue to higher margin Fully Electronic execution, and as our recently added brokers and salespeople ramp up production, we expect the Company's revenues and profits to grow.\nTotal expenses increased $205.8 million to $2,021.6 million, primarily due to a $118.9 million increase in non-compensation expenses driven by the impact of acquisitions; expenses related to the Company's previously disclosed settlements with the CFTC and the NYAG; interest expense associated with increased borrowing; and the Company's increased investment in technology. The increase in non-compensation expenses was also impacted by rent during the build-out of BGC's new U.K.-based headquarters, which was recently completed. Compensation expenses increased by $86.8 million, which was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions.\nOn February 5, 2020, the Board declared a 14 cent dividend for the fourth quarter. We anticipate having substantial resources with which to pay dividends, repurchase shares and/or units, profitably hire, and make accretive acquisitions, all with the goal of maintaining our investment grade rating.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (in

This increase was mainly due to higher global volumes.\nOur FX revenues decreased by $25.9 million, or 6.5%, to $370.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Our assets consist largely of cash, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our business. Longer-term capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and potential capital investment opportunities. Total assets as of December 31, 2019 were $3.9 billion, an increase of 14.1% as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets was driven primarily by increases in Cash segregated under regulatory requirements, Accrued commissions and other receivables, net and less liquid assets, including ROU assets for leases. We maintain a significant portion of our assets in Cash and cash equivalents and Securities owned, with our liquidity (which we define as Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements) as of December 31, 2019 of $473.2 million. See Liquidity Analysis\u201d below for a further discussion of our liquidity. Our Securities owned were $57.5 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $58.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Our Marketable securities decreased to $14.2 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $32.1 million as of December 31, 2018. We did not have any Reverse repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We had Securities loaned of $13.9 million and no Repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had Securities loaned of $15.1 million and Repurchase agreements of $1.0 million.\nOn March 19, 2018, we entered into the BGC Credit Agreement with Cantor. The BGC Credit Agreement provides for each party and certain of its subsidiaries to issue loans to the other party or any of its subsidiaries in the lender's discretion in an aggregate principal amount up to $250.0 million outstanding at any time. The BGC Credit Agreement replaced the previous Credit Facility between BGC and an affiliate of Cantor, and was approved by the Audit Committee. On August 6, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the BGC Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate principal amount that can be loaned to the other party or any of its subsidiaries from $250.0 million to $400.0 million that can be outstanding at any time. The BGC Credit Agreement will mature on the earlier to occur of (a) March 19, 2020, after which the maturity date of the BGC Credit Agreement will continue to be extended for successive one-year periods unless prior written notice of non-extension is given by a lending party to a borrowing party at least six months in advance of such renewal date and (b) the termination of the BGC Credit Agreement by either party pursuant to its terms. The outstanding amounts under the BGC Credit Agreement will bear interest for any rate period at a per annum rate equal to the higher of BGC's or Cantor's short-term borrowing rate in effect at such time plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings by BGC or Cantor outstanding under this Agreement.\nAs part of our cash management process, we may enter into tri-party reverse repurchase agreements and other short-term investments, some of which may be with Cantor. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no reverse repurchase agreements outstanding.\nAdditionally, in August 2013, the Audit Committee authorized us to invest up to $350 million in an asset-backed commercial paper program for which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The notes are backed by assets of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy guidelines, including policies relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from the short-term note issuer and the rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no investments in the program.\nFunding\nOur funding base consists of longer-term capital (equity and notes payable), collateralized financings, shorter-term liabilities and accruals that are a natural outgrowth of specific assets and/or our business model, such as matched fails and accrued compensation. We have limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our regulated entities for their brokerage businesses. Contingent liquidity needs are largely limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Capital expenditures tend to be cash neutral and approximately in line with depreciation. Current cash balances exceed our potential normal course contingent liquidity needs. We believe that cash in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks and cash segregated under regulatory requirements, is adequate for potential cash demands of normal operations, such as margin or fail financing. We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, including any dividends paid pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we continually evaluate opportunities for us to maximize our growth and further enhance our strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types and combinations of equity, debt and acquisition alternatives. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds to:\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support operations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> support continued growth in our businesses;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> effect acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and other transactions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> develop new or enhanced products, services and markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> respond to competitive pressures.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquisitions and financial reporting obligations related thereto may impact our ability to access longer-term capital markets funding on a timely basis and may necessitate greater short-term borrowings in the interim. This may impact our credit rating or the interest rates on our debt. We may need to access short-term capital sources to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not limited to, conducting operations; hiring or retaining brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel; financing acquisitions; and providing liquidity, including in situations where we may not be able to access the capital markets in a timely manner when desired by us. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.\nAs described earlier in this document, on November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of Newmark. (See Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off\u201d above for more information). As set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Newmark assumed certain BGC indebtedness and repaid such indebtedness. (See Notes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\u201d below for more information).\nOn January 12, 2016, we completed the two-step GFI Merger. The GFI Merger allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33% of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did not already own. Following the closing of the GFI Merger, BGC and its affiliates owned 100% of the outstanding shares of GFI's common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, which we define as Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements, was $473.2 million. We expect to use our financial resources to repay debt, profitably hire, make accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, and/or repurchase shares and units of BGC, all while maintaining or improving our investment-grade rating.\nNotes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\nUnsecured Senior Revolving Credit Agreement\nOn September 8, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The revolving credit agreement provided for revolving loans of up to $400.0 million. The maturity date of the facility was September 8, 2019. On November 22, 2017, the Company and Newmark entered into an amendment to the unsecured senior revolving credit agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the then-outstanding borrowings of the Company under the revolving credit facility were converted into the Converted Term Loan. There was no change in the maturity date or interest rate. Effective December 13, 2017, Newmark assumed the obligations of the Company as borrower under the Converted Term Loan. We remained a borrower under, and retained access to, the revolving credit facility for any future draws, subject to availability which increased as Newmark repaid the Converted Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the outstanding balance of the Converted Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed $195.0 million under the committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement and repaid the $195.0 million during the year. Therefore, there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nOn November 28, 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement which replaced the existing committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement. The maturity date of the new Revolving Credit Agreement was November 28, 2020 and the maximum revolving loan balance has been reduced from $400.0 million to $350.0 million. Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus additional margin. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the new unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the maturity date was extended to February 26, 2021. There was no change to the interest rate or the maximum revolving loan balance. On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, pursuant to which, the maturity date was extended by two years to February 26, 2023. The size of the Revolving Credit Agreement, along with the interest rate on the borrowings therefrom, remained unchanged. As of December 31, 2019, there was $68.9 million of borrowings outstanding, net of deferred financing costs of $1.1 million, under the new unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement. The average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nUnsecured Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement\nOn September 8, 2017, we entered into the Term Loan. The Term Loan provided for loans of up to $575.0 million. The maturity date of the Term Loan was September 8, 2019. On November 22, 2017, we and Newmark entered into an amendment to the Term Loan. Pursuant to the Term Loan amendment and effective as of December 13, 2017, Newmark assumed the obligations of the Company as borrower under the Term Loan. There was no change in the maturity date or interest rate. As of December 31, 2017, Newmark had $270.7 million borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the outstanding balance of $270.7 million at which point the facility was terminated. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan.\n8.125% Senior Notes\nOn June 26, 2012, we issued an aggregate of $112.5 million principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2042. The 8.125% Senior Notes were senior unsecured obligations. The 8.125% Senior Notes were redeemable for cash, in whole or in part, on or after June 26, 2017, at our option, at any time and from time to time, until maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date. The 8.125% Senior Notes were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BGCA.\u201d We used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. In connection with the issuance of the 8.125% Senior Notes, the Company lent the proceeds of the 8.125% Senior Notes to BGC U.S. OpCo, and BGC U.S. OpCo issued the 2042 Promissory Note.\nThe initial carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes was $108.7 million, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million. On December 13, 2017, Newmark OpCo assumed all of the BGC U.S. OpCo's rights and obligations under the 2042 Promissory Note. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the Company in full for the 2042 Promissory Note, and the Company subsequently repaid the 8.125% Senior Notes on September 5, 2018.\n5.375% Senior Notes\nOn December 9, 2014, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes. The 5.375% Senior Notes were general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. These Senior Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per year, payable in cash on June 9 and December 9 of each year, commencing June 9, 2015. The interest rate payable on the notes was subject to adjustments from time to time based on the debt rating assigned by specified rating agencies to the notes, as set forth in the Indenture. The 5.375% Senior Notes were scheduled to mature on December 9, 2019. In connection with the issuance of the 5.375% Senior Notes, we lent the proceeds of the 5.375% Senior Notes to BGC U.S. OpCo, and BGC U.S. OpCo issued the 2019 Promissory Note. On December 13, 2017, Newmark OpCo assumed all of BGC U.S. OpCo's rights and obligations under the 2019 Promissory Note. The initial carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes was $295.1 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the Company in full for the 2019 Promissory Note, and the Company subsequently redeemed the 5.375% Senior Notes on December 5, 2018.\n8.375% Senior Notes\nAs part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes. Interest on these notes was payable, semi-annually in arrears on the 19th of January and July. On July 19, 2018, the Company repaid the $240.0 million principal amount of its 8.375% Senior Notes upon their maturity.\n5.125% Senior Notes\nOn May 27, 2016, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes.

The 5.125% Senior Notes will mature on May 27, 2021. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time for cash at certain make-whole\u201d redemption prices (as set forth in the Indenture). If a Change of Control Triggering Event\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of its notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. Cantor purchased $15.0 million of such senior notes and still holds such notes as of December 31, 2019.\nThe initial carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes was $295.8 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.2 million. The carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $298.7 million.\n5.375% Senior Notes due 2023\nOn July 24, 2018, we issued an aggregate of $450.0 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023.

We also paid CF&Co an advisory fee of $0.2 million in connection with the issuance. The issuance costs are amortized as interest expense and the carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $445.2 million.\nOn July 31, 2018, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which, upon being declared effective by the SEC, the holders of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023, issued in a private placement on July 24, 2018, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\n3.750% Senior Notes\nOn September 27, 2019, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 3.750% Senior Notes.

The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2018 was $0.1 million.\nOn May 31, 2017, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $29.9 million under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.44% and matures on May 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $11.7 million and $19.2 million, respectively, outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement.

The credit agreement provides for short-term loans of up to $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million). The maturity date of the agreement is May 20, 2020. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the Brazilian Interbank offering rate plus 3.30%. As of December 31, 2019, there were $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million) of borrowings outstanding under the facility. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate was 7.8%.\nOn August 23, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Itau Unibanco S.A. The credit agreement provides for an intra-day overdraft credit line up to $12.4 million (BRL 50.0 million). The maturity date of the agreement is March 13, 2020. This facility bears a fee of 1.00% per year. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.\nCREDIT RATINGS\nAs of December 31, 2019, our public long-term credit ratings and associated outlooks are as follows:\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Rating\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Outlook\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fitch Ratings Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Stable\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Standard & Poor's\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Stable\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm's competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlooks could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.\nLIQUIDITY ANALYSIS\nWe consider our liquidity to be comprised of the sum of Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities, and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements. The discussion below describes the key components of our liquidity analysis, including earnings, dividends and distributions, net investing and funding activities, including repurchases and redemptions of BGC Class A common stock and partnership units, security settlements, changes in securities held and marketable securities, and changes in our working capital.\nWe consider the following in analyzing changes in our liquidity.\nOur liquidity analysis includes a comparison of our Consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for Consolidated net income from discontinued operations, net of tax and certain non-cash items (e.g., Equity-based compensation) as presented on the cash flow statement. Dividends and distributions are payments made to our holders of common shares and limited partnership interests and are related to earnings from prior periods. These timing differences will impact our cash flows in a given period.\nOur investing and funding activities represent a combination of our capital raising activities, including short-term borrowings and repayments, issuances of shares under our CEO Program (net), BGC Class A common stock repurchases and partnership unit redemptions, purchases and sales of securities, dispositions, and other investments (e.g. acquisitions, forgivable loans to new brokers and capital expenditures-all net of depreciation and amortization).\nOur securities settlement activities primarily represent deposits with clearing organizations. In addition, when advantageous, we may elect to facilitate the settlement of matched principal transactions by funding failed trades, which results in a temporary secured use of cash and is economically beneficial to us.\nOther changes in working capital represent changes primarily in receivables and payables and accrued liabilities that impact our liquidity.\nChanges in Reverse repurchase agreements, Securities owned, and Marketable securities may result from additional cash investments or sales, which will be offset by a corresponding change in Cash and cash equivalents and, accordingly, will not result in a change in our liquidity. Conversely, changes in the market value of such securities are reflected in our earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) and will result in changes in our liquidity.\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company completed the calculation of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' earnings pursuant to the Tax Act and previously recorded a net cumulative tax expense of $25.0 million, net of foreign tax credits. An installment election can be made to pay the taxes over eight years with 40% paid in equal installments over the first five years and the remaining 60% to be paid in installments of 15%, 20% and 25% in years six, seven and eight, respectively. The cumulative remaining balance as of December 31, 2019 is $19.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $415.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents, and included in this amount was $286.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries.\nDiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2019\nThe table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 415.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 336.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 473.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 410.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $13.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively, of Marketable securities on our balance sheet had been lent in a Securities loaned transaction and, therefore, are not included in this Liquidity Analysis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $62.3 million increase in our liquidity position from $410.9 million as of December 31, 2018 to $473.2 million as of December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the issuance of $300.0 million of the 3.750% Senior Notes, increased collateralized and other net borrowings of $82.6 million, partially offset by the financing of acquisitions, ordinary movements in working capital, and our continued investment in new revenue generating hires.\nDiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 336.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 513.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Securities owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Marketable securities1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 410.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 552.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $15.1 million and $144.7 million, respectively, of Marketable securities on our balance sheet had been lent in a Securities loaned transaction and therefore are not included in this Liquidity Analysis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe $141.3 million decrease in our liquidity position from $552.1 million as of December 31, 2017 to $410.9 million as of December 31, 2018 was primarily related to our purchase of exchangeable limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings in the Investment in Newmark, cash paid with respect to various acquisitions throughout the year, our continued investment in revenue generating hires, and ordinary movements in working capital.\nCLEARING CAPITAL\nIn November 2008, we entered into a clearing capital agreement with Cantor to clear U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities transactions on our behalf. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, so long as Cantor is providing clearing services to us, Cantor shall be entitled to request from us, and we shall post as soon as practicable, cash or other property acceptable to Cantor in the amount reasonably requested by Cantor under the clearing capital agreement. Cantor had not requested any cash or other property from us as collateral as of December 31, 2019.\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nOur liquidity and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements of our operating subsidiaries. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in civil and criminal judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, enhanced oversight, remediation, or other relief.\nIn addition, self-regulatory organizations, such as the FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the FCA, the SEC, and the CFTC require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not designed to specifically protect stockholders. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements.\nThe final phase of Basel III (unofficially called Basel IV\u201d) is a global prudential regulatory standard designed to make banks more resilient and increase confidence in the banking system. Its wide scope includes reviewing market, credit and operational risk along with targeted changes to leverage ratios. Basel IV includes updates to the calculation of bank capital requirements with the aim of making outcomes more comparable across banks globally. Most of the requirements are expected to be implemented by national and regional authorities by around 2022. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces.\nThe FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the U.K. The FCA's objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations.\nIn addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. For example, in Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC, GFI (HK) Securities LLC and Sunrise Broker (Hong Kong) Limited are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) Pty Limited and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited's Tokyo branch and BGC Capital Markets Japan LLC's Tokyo Branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, and GFI Group Pte Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets & Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators. In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC Brokers L.P. is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements imposed upon it by local regulators.\nThese subsidiaries may also be prohibited from repaying the borrowings of their parents or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to their parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions, in each case, that result in a significant reduction in their regulatory capital position without prior notification or approval from their principal regulator. See Note 22- Regulatory Requirements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our regulatory requirements.\nAs of December 31, 2019, $561.9 million of net assets were held by regulated subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, these subsidiaries had aggregate regulatory net capital, as defined, in excess of the aggregate regulatory requirements, as defined, of $291.2 million.\nIn April 2013, the Board and Audit Committee authorized management to enter into indemnification agreements with Cantor and its affiliates with respect to the provision of any guarantees provided by Cantor and its affiliates from time to time as required by regulators. These services may be provided from time to time at a reasonable and customary fee.\nBGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October 2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January 22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for made available to trade\u201d products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also own ELX, which became a dormant contract market on July 1, 2017.\nMuch of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S. based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we will continue to operate a number of EU regulated venues in accordance with EU directives and licensed by the FCA and other EU-based national Competent Authorities. These venues are also operated for non-derivative instruments for these clients. MiFID II was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority in September 2015, and implemented in January 2018 and introduced important infrastructural changes.\nMiFID II requires a significant part of the market in these instruments to trade on trading venues subject to transparency regimes, not only in pre- and post-trade prices, but also in fee structures and access. In addition, it has impacted a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection.\nMiFID II is intended to help improve the functioning of the EU single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards. By design, therefore, it is intended that EU member states should have very similar regulatory regimes in relation to the matters addressed to MiFID. MiFID II has also introduced a new regulated execution venue category known as an OTF that captures much of the Voice-and Hybrid-oriented trading in EU. Much of our existing EU derivatives and fixed income execution business now take place on OTFs. Brexit may impact future market structures and MiFID II rulemaking and implementation due to potential changes in mutual passporting between the U.K. and EU member states.\nIn addition, the GDPR came into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018 and creates new compliance obligations in relation to personal data. The GDPR may affect our practices, and will increase financial penalties for non-compliance significantly.\nIn September 2019, two of the Company's subsidiaries, BGC Financial L.P. and GFI Group Inc., settled investigations conducted jointly by the CFTC and the NYAG. The CFTC and NYAG alleged that, in 2014 and 2015, certain emerging markets FX options (EFX options) brokers in the U.S. misrepresented that certain prices posted to their electronic platform were immediately executable when in fact they were not and that such brokers had communicated that transactions had been matched when they had not. On October 9, 2019, the Company paid an aggregate of $25.0 million in connection with the settlements and agreed to a monitor for two years to assess regulatory compliance. The NYAG settlements include a non-prosecution agreement, and there was no criminal penalty from either agency.\nSee Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nEQUITY\nClass A Common Stock\nChanges in shares of the Company's Class A common stock outstanding were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shares outstanding at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 256,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share issuances:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Redemption/exchanges of limited partnership interests\u00b9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuance of Class A common stock for general corporate purposes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,924\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred stock awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Vesting of restricted stock units (RSUs)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other issuances of Class A common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exchange from Class A to Class B common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (11,036\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury stock repurchases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (233\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (789\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Forfeitures of restricted Class A common stock\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (232\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Shares outstanding at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 307,915\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 291,475\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Included in redemption/exchanges of limited partnership interests for the year ended December 31, 2019, are 10.1 million shares of BGC Class A common stock granted in connection with the cancellation of 11.5 million LPUs.

Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B Issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.\nThe Company did not issue any shares of BGC Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019.

The contingent Class A common stock is recorded as a liability and included in Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2019.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fully diluted period-end spot share count was as follows (in thousands):\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 353,799\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Partnership units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 172,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs (Treasury stock method)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,308\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 530,371\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn June 5, 2015, we entered into the Exchange Agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold BGC Class B common stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of BGC Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of BGC Class B common stock. Such shares of BGC Class B common stock, which currently can be acquired upon the exchange of Cantor units owned in BGC Holdings, are already included in our fully diluted share count and will not increase Cantor's current maximum potential voting power in the common equity. The Exchange Agreement enabled the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of BGC Class B common stock that they were already entitled to acquire without having to exchange its Cantor units in BGC Holdings. The Audit Committee and Board have determined that it was in the best interests of us and our stockholders to approve the Exchange Agreement because it will help ensure that Cantor retains its Cantor units in BGC Holdings, which is the same partnership in which our partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees. On November 23, 2018, in the Class B Issuance, BGC issued 10,323,366 shares of BGC Class B common stock to Cantor and 712,907 shares of BGC Class B common stock to CFGM, an affiliate of Cantor, in each case in exchange for shares of BGC Class A common stock from Cantor and CFGM, respectively, on a one-to-one basis pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B issuance was exempt from the Securities Act. Following this exchange, Cantor and its affiliates only have the right to exchange under the Exchange Agreement up to an aggregate of 23,613,420 shares of BGC Class A common stock, now owned or subsequently acquired, or its Cantor units in BGC Holdings, into shares of BGC Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2019, Cantor and CFGM do not own any shares of BGC Class A common stock.\nWe and Cantor have agreed that any shares of BGC Class B common stock issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of BGC Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of Cantor units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the Cantor entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of BGC Class B Stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of Cantor units.\nOn November 4, 2015, partners of BGC Holdings created five new classes of non-distributing partnership units (collectively with the NPSUs, N Units\u201d). These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional N\u201d to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of BGC Class A common stock. The Eleventh Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee and by the Board.\nSubject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, certain N Units may be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into an REU) and will then participate in partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the general partner of BGC Holdings in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. Such N Units are not included in the fully diluted share count.\nOn December 14, 2016, partners of BGC Holdings amended certain terms and conditions of the partnership's N Units in order to provide flexibility to the Company and the Partnership in using such N Units in connection with compensation arrangements and practices. The amendment provides for a minimum $5 million gross revenue requirement in a given quarter as a condition for an N Unit to be replaced by another type of partnership unit in accordance with the Partnership Agreement and the grant documentation. The amendment was approved by the Audit Committee.\nOn December 13, 2017, the Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement was amended and restated a second time to include prior standalone amendments and to make certain other changes related to the Separation. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement, among other things, reflects changes resulting from the division in the Separation of BGC Holdings into BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, including:\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an apportionment of the existing economic attributes (including, among others, capital accounts and post-termination payments) of each BGC Holdings limited partnership interests outstanding immediately prior to the Separation between such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit and the fraction of a Newmark Holdings LPU issued in the Separation in respect of such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit, based on the relative value of BGC and Newmark as of after the Newmark IPO;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> an adjustment of the exchange mechanism between the Newmark IPO and the Distribution so that one exchangeable BGC Holdings unit together with a number of exchangeable Newmark Holdings units equal to 0.4545 divided by the Newmark Holdings Exchange Ratio as of such time, must be exchanged in order to receive one share of BGC Class A common stock; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a right of the employer of a partner (whether it be Newmark or BGC) to determine whether to grant exchangeability with respect to Legacy BGC Holdings Units or Legacy Newmark Holdings Units held by such partner.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement also removes certain classes of BGC Holdings units that are no longer outstanding, and permits the general partner of BGC Holdings to determine the total number of authorized BGC Holdings units. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement was approved by the Audit Committee.\nRegistration Statements\nWe currently have in place an effective equity shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on March 9, 2018 with respect to the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis. On March 9, 2018, we entered into the March 2018 Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of shares of BGC Class A common stock. Proceeds from shares of BGC Class A common stock sold under this CEO Program Sales Agreement may be used for redemptions of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, as well as for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and the repayment of debt. CF&Co is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cantor and an affiliate of us. Under this Sales Agreement, we have agreed to pay CF&Co 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares. For additional information on the Company's CEO Program sales agreements, see Note 14- Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have issued and sold 17,401,431 shares of BGC Class A common stock (or $209.8 million) under the March 2018 Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, we had sold all 20 million shares of BGC Class A common stock pursuant to each of the November 2014 Sales Agreement and April 2017 Sales Agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds of any shares of BGC Class A common stock sold for general corporate purposes for potential acquisitions, redemptions of LPUs and FPUs in BGC Holdings and repurchases of shares of BGC Class A common stock from partners, executive officers and other employees of ours or our subsidiaries and of Cantor and its affiliates. Certain of such partners will be expected to use the proceeds from such sales to repay outstanding loans issued by, or credit enhanced by, Cantor, or BGC Holdings. In addition to general corporate purposes, these sales along with our share repurchase authorization are designed as a planning device in order to facilitate the redemption process. Going forward, we may redeem units and reduce our fully diluted share count under our repurchase authorization or later sell shares of BGC Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement.\nFurther, we have an effective registration statement on Form S-4 filed on September 3, 2010, with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20 million shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued an aggregate of 13.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under this Form S-4 registration statement. Additionally, on September 13, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4, with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20 million shares of Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we have not issued any shares of BGC Class A common stock under this Form S-4 registration statement. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 10 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under the BGC Partners, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued approximately 0.6 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.\nThe Compensation Committee may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock such as RSUs, bonus stock, performance awards, dividend equivalents and other equity-based awards, including to provide exchange rights for shares of BGC Class A common stock upon exchange of LPUs. On June 22, 2016, at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved our Equity Plan to increase from 350 million to 400 million the aggregate number of shares of BGC Class A common stock that may be delivered or cash-settled pursuant to awards granted during the life of the Equity Plan. As of December 31, 2019, the limit on the aggregate number of shares authorized to be delivered allowed for the grant of future awards relating to 137.7 million shares of BGC Class A common stock.\nOn July 31, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 which were issued in a private placement, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nOn October 11, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of the 3.750% Senior Notes which were issued in a private placement, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nOn December 16, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which CF&Co may make offers and sales of our 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 and 3.750% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which may occur from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any other of our affiliates, has any obligation to make a market in our securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice.\nCONTINGENT PAYMENTS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS\nSince 2016, the Company has completed acquisitions whose purchase price included an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $9.2 million), 0.1 million LPUs (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $0.2 million), 0.2 million RSUs (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $1.2 million) and $34.3 million in cash that may be issued contingent on certain targets being met through 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has issued 0.3 million shares of its Class A common stock and paid $14.6 million in cash related to such contingent payments.\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1.9 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock and 0.2 million RSUs remain to be issued, and $24.1 million in cash remains to be paid, net of forfeitures and other adjustments, if the targets are met.\nDERIVATIVE SUIT\nOn October 5, 2018, Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund filed a putative derivative complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court, captioned Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund vs. Howard Lutnick, et al. (Case No. 2018-0722), alleging breaches of fiduciary duty against (i) the members of the Board, (ii) Howard Lutnick, CFGM, and Cantor as controlling stockholders of BGC, and (iii) Howard Lutnick as an officer of BGC. The complaint challenges the transactions by which BGC (i) completed the Berkeley Point acquisition from CCRE for $875 million and (ii) committed to invest $100 million for a 27% interest in Real Estate, L.P. (collectively, the Transaction\u201d). Among other things, the complaint alleges that (i) the price BGC paid in connection with the Transaction was unfair, (ii) the process leading up to the Transaction was unfair, and (iii) the members of the special committee of the Board were not independent. It seeks to recover for the Company unquantified damages, disgorgement of any payments received by defendants, and attorneys' fees.\nA month later, on November 5, 2018, the same plaintiffs' firm filed an identical putative derivative complaint against the same defendants seeking the same relief on behalf of a second client, Northern California Pipe Trades Trust Funds. The cases have been consolidated into a single action, captioned In re BGC Partners, Inc. Derivative Litigation (Consolidated C.A. No. 2018-0722-AGB), and the complaint filed by Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund on October 5, 2018 was designated as the operative complaint.\nIn response to motions to dismiss filed by all defendants in December 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the operative complaint in February 2019, requesting that the Court allow them to supplement their allegations, which the Court granted. The amended complaint alleges the same purported breaches of fiduciary duty as the operative complaint, raises no new claims, and seeks identical relief, but includes additional allegations, including alleged reasons for plaintiffs' failure to make a demand on the Board, which was the basis of defendants' motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2019, all defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints, again on demand grounds. On September 30, 2019, the Court denied defendants' motions to dismiss, permitting the case to move forward into discovery. In its ruling, the Court determined that the amended complaint sufficiently pled that plaintiffs were not required to make demand on the Board in order to file a derivative suit, but did not make findings of fact with respect to the underlying merits of plaintiffs' allegations concerning the Transaction.\nThe Company continues to believe that the allegations pled against the defendants in the amended complaint are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously as the case moves forward. However, as in any litigated matter, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty.\nPURCHASE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS\nCantor has the right to purchase limited partnership interests (Cantor units) from BGC Holdings upon redemption of non-exchangeable FPUs redeemed by BGC Holdings upon termination or bankruptcy of the Founding/Working Partner. In addition, pursuant to Article Eight, Section 8.08, of the Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement (previously the sixth amendment) and Article Eight, Section 8.08, of the Newmark Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement, where either current, terminating, or terminated partners are permitted by the Company to exchange any portion of their FPUs and Cantor consents to such exchangeability, the Company shall offer to Cantor the opportunity for Cantor to purchase the same number of new exchangeable limited partnership interests (Cantor units) in BGC Holdings at the price that Cantor would have paid for the FPUs had the Company redeemed them. Any such Cantor units purchased by Cantor are currently exchangeable for up to 23,613,420 shares of BGC Class B common stock or, at Cantor's election or if there are no such additional shares of BGC Class B common stock, shares of BGC Class A common stock, in each case on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments).\nOn November 7, 2016, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 624,762 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 141,523 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $560,190, Cantor purchased 141,523 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $560,190. In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, on November 7, 2016, Cantor purchased 483,239 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $1,796,367 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange for 483,239 founding partner units. As a result of the Newmark IPO and the related Separation and Distribution Agreement, the aggregate exchangeable limited partnership units represent 624,762 and 283,983 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, respectively.\nOn November 7, 2017, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 1,179,788 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 823,178 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $2,828,629, Cantor purchased 823,178 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $2,828,629. In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, on November 7, 2017, Cantor purchased 356,610 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $1,091,175 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange for 356,610 founding partner units. As a result of the Newmark IPO and the related Separation and Distribution Agreement, the aggregate exchangeable limited partnership units represent 1,179,788 and 536,267 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were 1,749,347 FPUs in BGC Holdings remaining, which the partnerships had the right to redeem or exchange and with respect to which Cantor had the right to purchase an equivalent number of Cantor units.\nJOINT SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CANTOR\nIn February 2019, the Audit Committee authorized us to enter into a short-term services agreement with Cantor pursuant to which Cantor would be responsible for clearing, settling and processing certain transactions executed on behalf of customers in exchange for a 33% revenue share based on net transaction revenue and the payment by BGC of the fully allocated cost of certain salespersons related thereto.\nGUARANTEE AGREEMENT FROM CF&CO\nUnder rules adopted by the CFTC, all foreign introducing brokers engaging in transactions with U.S. persons are required to register with the NFA and either meet financial reporting and net capital requirements on an individual basis or obtain a guarantee agreement from a registered Futures Commission Merchant. Our European-based brokers engage from time to time in interest rate swap transactions with U.S.-based counterparties, and therefore we are subject to the CFTC requirements. CF&Co has entered into guarantees on our behalf (and on behalf of GFI), and we are required to indemnify CF&Co for the amounts, if any, paid by CF&Co on our behalf pursuant to this arrangement. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded expenses of $125,000 with respect to these guarantees.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nThe Company was authorized to enter into loans, investments or other credit support arrangements for Aqua; such arrangements are proportionally and on the same terms as similar arrangements between Aqua and Cantor. On February 5, 2020, the Company's Board and Audit Committee increased the authorized amount by an additional $2.0 million. The Company has been further authorized to provide counterparty or similar guarantees on behalf of Aqua from time to time, provided that liability for any such guarantees, as well as similar guarantees provided by Cantor, would be shared proportionally with Cantor (see Note 14- Related Party Transactions,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information).\nUNIT REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES-EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nOn March 27, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees authorized the purchase by the Company from Stephen M. Merkel of up to 250,000 shares of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on March 26, 2019.

The Company repurchased the 53,368 shares from the charitable foundation at a price of $11.73 per share, which was the closing price of BGC Class A common stock on that date. The transaction was approved by the Audit Committee.\nOn February 16, 2018, the Audit Committee authorized the purchase by Mr. Lutnick's retirement plan of up to $105,000 of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on the date of purchase.

See Note 15- Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our investments in unconsolidated entities.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES and estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated statements of financial condition, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, the spread between the buy and sell prices on matched principal transactions, fees from related parties, data, software and post-trade services, and other revenues. See Note 3- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nEquity-Based and Other Compensation\nDiscretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense is comprised of discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary bonuses, actual results may differ.\nRestricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the U.S. GAAP guidance. RSUs provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with the U.S. GAAP, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nThe fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of BGC Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards' vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nRestricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per the U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates' customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nLimited Partnership Units: LPUs in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings are generally held by employees. Generally, such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain LPUs, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability or redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of common stock to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange or grant. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. Our Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such LPUs are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nCertain of these LPUs entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount, generally in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These LPUs are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under the U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we recognize a liability for these units on our consolidated statements of financial condition as part of Accrued compensation\u201d for the amortized portion of the post-termination payment amount, based on the current fair value of the expected future cash payout. We amortize the post-termination payment amount, less an expected forfeiture rate, over the vesting period, and record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period in our consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d\nCertain LPUs are granted exchangeability into shares of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock or are redeemed in connection with the grant of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock issued; BGC Class A common stock is issued on a one-for-one basis, and Newmark Class A common stock is issued based on the number of LPUs exchanged or redeemed multiplied by the then Exchange Ratio. At the time exchangeability is granted or shares of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock are issued, we recognize an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred compensation expense of $100.9 million, $150.1 million and $176.5 million, respectively.\nCertain LPUs have a stated vesting schedule and do not receive quarterly allocations of net income. Compensation expense related to these LPUs is recognized over the stated service period, and these units generally vest between two and five years. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred compensation expense related to these LPUs of $36.7 million, $11.4 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. This expense is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nEmployee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain employees and partners, whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted. The distributions are treated as compensation expense when made and the proceeds are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $315.6 million and $216.9 million, respectively, and is included as Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net\u201d in our consolidated statements of financial condition. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $35.7 million, $13.0 million and $26.9 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of Compensation and employee benefits\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in the U.S. GAAP guidance, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step process as follows.\nThe first step involves comparing each reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment.\nThe second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in the U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of our entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to UBT in the City of New York. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d for a discussion of partnership interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners' tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.\nWe provide for uncertain tax positions based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Provision for income taxes\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nThe measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because our interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, which includes the global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, provision. This provision requires inclusion in the Company's U.S. income tax return the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected to treat taxes associated with the GILTI provision using the Period Cost Method and thus has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences under this regime.\nSee Note 3- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these critical accounting policies and other significant accounting policies.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 1- Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "Given the current uncertainty around the future trade relationship and/or the length of the transition period, the consequences for the economies of the U.K. and the EU member states as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU are unknown and unpredictable.

Notes. The 5.375% Senior Notes were general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. These Senior Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per year, payable in cash on June 9 and December 9 of each year, commencing June 9, 2015. The interest rate payable on the notes was subject to adjustments from time to time based on the debt rating assigned by specified rating agencies to the notes, as set forth in the Indenture. The 5.375% Senior Notes were scheduled to mature on December 9, 2019. In connection with the issuance of the 5.375% Senior Notes, we lent the proceeds of the 5.375% Senior Notes to BGC U.S. OpCo, and BGC U.S. OpCo issued the 2019 Promissory Note. On December 13, 2017, Newmark OpCo assumed all of BGC U.S. OpCo's rights and obligations under the 2019 Promissory Note. The initial carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes was $295.1 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the Company in full for the 2019 Promissory Note, and the Company subsequently redeemed the 5.375% Senior Notes on December 5, 2018.\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Three\nMonths Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Common stock outstanding1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 351,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 344,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Partnership units2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 178,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 178,813\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSUs (Treasury stock method)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 532,017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 524,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOccupancy and Equipment\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company continues to believe that the allegations pled against the defendants in the amended complaint are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously as the case moves forward. However, as in any litigated matter, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty.\nOther income (loss) decreased by $17.5 million, or 34.7% to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily driven by a decrease related to fair value adjustments on investments carried under the measurement alternative. There was also a decrease related the mark-to-market and/or hedging on the Nasdaq earn out shares. This was partially offset by an increase in other recoveries related to our insurance business.\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\nResults\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\nof Total\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\nResults\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\nof Total\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Actual\nResults\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Percentage\nof Total\nRevenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Issuance of common stock and exchangeability\nexpenses\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 150,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 176,463\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allocations of net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,008\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> LPU amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> RSU amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,465\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity-based compensation and allocations of net\nincome to limited partnership units and FPUs\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 165,612\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 205,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 233,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiscretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense is comprised of discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof.

The CFTC and NYAG alleged that, in 2014 and 2015, certain emerging markets FX options (EFX options) brokers in the U.S. misrepresented that certain prices posted to their electronic platform were immediately executable when in fact they were not and that such brokers had communicated that transactions had been matched when they had not. On October 9, 2019, the Company paid an aggregate of $25.0 million in connection with the settlements and agreed to a monitor for two years to assess regulatory compliance. The NYAG settlements include a non-prosecution agreement, and there was no criminal penalty from either agency.\nRates\nWe have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business environment through acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed in the current business environment.\nTable 235: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

This increase was primarily driven by improved global volumes and increased market volatility.\nOur position as a leading wholesale financial broker is enhanced by our Hybrid brokerage platform. We believe that the more complex, less liquid markets on which we focus often require significant amounts of personal and attentive service from our brokers. In more mature markets, we offer Fully Electronic execution capabilities to our customers through our platforms, including Fenics and BGC Trader. Our Hybrid platform allows our customers to trade on a Voice, Hybrid or, where available, Fully Electronic basis, regardless of whether the trade is OTC or exchange-based, and to benefit from the experience and market intelligence of our worldwide brokerage network. Our electronic capabilities include clearing, settlement, post-trade, and other back-office services as well as straight-through processing for our customers across several products. Furthermore, we benefit from the operational leverage in our Fully Electronic platform. We believe our Hybrid brokerage approach provides a competitive advantage over competitors who do not offer this full range of technology.\n \u2022 support continued growth in our businesses; \nGain (Loss) on Divestiture and Sale of Investments\nThe financial services industry has grown historically due to several factors. One factor was the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in the value of FX, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors and changes in the prices of commodity products. Over this same timeframe, demand from financial institutions, financial services intermediaries and large corporations have increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business opportunity for financial intermediaries.\nWe currently have in place an effective equity shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on March 9, 2018 with respect to the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis. On March 9, 2018, we entered into the March 2018 Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of shares of BGC Class A common stock. Proceeds from shares of BGC Class A common stock sold under this CEO Program Sales Agreement may be used for redemptions of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, as well as for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and the repayment of debt. CF&Co is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cantor and an affiliate of us. Under this Sales Agreement, we have agreed to pay CF&Co 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares. For additional information on the Company's CEO Program sales agreements, see Note 14- Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nThe $62.3 million increase in our liquidity position from $410.9 million as of December 31, 2018 to $473.2 million as of December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the issuance of $300.0 million of the 3.750% Senior Notes, increased collateralized and other net borrowings of $82.6 million, partially offset by the financing of acquisitions, ordinary movements in working capital, and our continued investment in new revenue generating hires.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Windeatt with respect to 139,265 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $5.17 per share on such date, had a value of $720,000) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $4.388 per unit) of 63,814 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $280,002 for taxes. On February 22, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Windeatt with respect to an additional 22,020 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $6.26 per share on such date, had a value of $137,845) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $5.6457 per unit) of 9,495 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $53,606 for taxes.\nGlobal FX volumes were generally lower during 2019. Spot FX volumes at CME, Refinitiv (formerly the Financial & Risk business of Thomson Reuters), and EBS (CME formerly NEX) were down 14%, flat, and down 17%, respectively. In comparison, our overall FX revenues decreased by 6.5% to $370.3 million.\n Included in redemption/exchanges of limited partnership interests for the year ended December 31, 2019, are 10.1 million shares of BGC Class A common stock granted in connection with the cancellation of 11.5 million LPUs. Included in redemption/exchanges of limited partnership interests for the year ended December 31, 2018, are 6.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock granted in connection with the cancellation of 7.6 million LPUs. Because LPUs are included in the Company's fully diluted share count, if dilutive, redemption/exchange in connection with the issuance of Class A common shares would not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units outstanding. \nWe expect to benefit from the secular trend towards electronic trading, increased demand for market data, and the need for increased automation and post-trade services. We continue to onboard new customers as the opportunities created by electronic and algorithmic trading continue to transform our industry. We continue to roll out our next-gen Fenics brokerage platforms across more products and geographies with the goal of seamlessly integrating Voice liquidity with customer electronic orders either by a graphical user interface or application programming interface, and we expect to have continued success converting Voice/Hybrid desks over time as we roll out these platforms across more products and geographies.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $51.1 million, or 5.4%, to $1,001.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The main drivers of this increase were the impact of higher brokerage revenues on variable compensation, and the acquisition of Poten & Partners in November 2018.\nOur brokerage revenues from energy and commodities increased by $24.2 million, or 11.9%, to $228.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by improved global volumes.\nOther income (loss) increased by $24.6 million, or 95.1%, to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a gain of $37.6 million related to a fair value adjustment on an investment held. This was partially offset by a decrease related to the mark-to-market and/or hedging on the Nasdaq shares and a decrease in other recoveries.\nCLEARING CAPITAL\n\nGains (Losses) on Divestitures and Sale of Investments\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes decreased by $22.9 million, or 30.1%, to $53.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by lower pre-tax earnings, as well as a change in the geographical and business mix of earnings, which can have an impact on our consolidated effective tax rate from period-to-period.\n \u2022 a right of the employer of a partner (whether it be Newmark or BGC) to determine whether to grant exchangeability with respect to Legacy BGC Holdings Units or Legacy Newmark Holdings Units held by such partner. \nIn April 2013, the Board and Audit Committee authorized management to enter into indemnification agreements with Cantor and its affiliates with respect to the provision of any guarantees provided by Cantor and its affiliates from time to time as required by regulators. These services may be provided from time to time at a reasonable and customary fee.\nData, Software and Post-Trade\nThrough brands including BGC\u00ae, GFI\u00ae, Sunrise\u2122, Besso\u2122, Ed Broking\u00ae, Poten & Partners\u2122 and RP Martin\u2122, among others, our businesses specialize in the brokerage of a broad range of products, including fixed income such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments, as well as related interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives. We also broker products across FX, equities, energy and commodities, insurance, and futures. Our businesses also provide a wide variety of services, including trade execution, brokerage services, clearing, trade compression, post-trade, information, and other back-office services to a broad assortment of financial and non-financial institutions. Our integrated platform is designed to provide flexibility to customers with regard to price discovery, execution and processing of transactions, and enables them to use Voice, Hybrid, or in many markets, Fully Electronic brokerage services in connection with transactions executed either OTC or through an exchange. Through our Fenics\u00ae group of electronic brands, we offer a number of market infrastructure and connectivity services, Fully Electronic marketplaces, and the Fully Electronic brokerage of certain products that also may trade via Voice and Hybrid execution. The full suite of Fenics\u00ae offerings include market data and related information services, Fully Electronic brokerage, compression and other post-trade services, analytics related to financial instruments and markets, and other financial technology solutions. Fenics\u00ae brands operate under the names Fenics\u00ae, BGC Trader\u2122, CreditMatch\u00ae, Fenics MD\u2122, BGC Market Data\u2122, kACE2\u00ae, EMBonds\u00ae, Capitalab\u00ae, Swaptioniser\u00ae, CBID\u00ae and Lucera\u00ae.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1.9 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock and 0.2 million RSUs remain to be issued, and $24.1 million in cash remains to be paid, net of forfeitures and other adjustments, if the targets are met.\nData, software and post-trade revenues increased by $8.0 million, or 12.2%, to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Poten & Partners, an increase in revenues from post-trade services and new business contracts.\nNet Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nWe consider our liquidity to be comprised of the sum of Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities, and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements. The discussion below describes the key components of our liquidity analysis, including earnings, dividends and distributions, net investing and funding activities, including repurchases and redemptions of BGC Class A common stock and partnership units, security settlements, changes in securities held and marketable securities, and changes in our working capital.\nNewmark IPO, Separation and Spin-Off\nGains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro-rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control.\nWe provide for uncertain tax positions based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Provision for income taxes\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOn October 11, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of the 3.750% Senior Notes which were issued in a private placement, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased by $35.2 million, or 23.5%, to $184.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increases related to the acquisitions of Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, and Ginga Petroleum, as well as rent expense related to the build-out phase of BGC's new U.K.-based headquarters.\n Financial results have been retrospectively adjusted as a result of the Spin-Off to reflect Newmark through November 30, 2018 as discontinued operations for all periods presented. \nKey drivers of our revenue are front-office producer headcount and average revenue per producer. We believe that our strong technology platform and unique partnership structure have enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to profitably increase our front-office staff at a faster rate than our largest competitors since our formation in 2004.\nGains (losses) on equity method investments increased by $2.8 million, or 59.4%, to a gain of $7.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a gain of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro-rata share of the net gains or losses on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control.\n\nIn connection with the Company's 2018 executive compensation process, the Company's executive officers received certain monetization of prior awards as set forth below.\nThe weighted-average share counts from continuing operations, including securities that were anti-dilutive for our earnings per share calculations, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nBrexit\nIn December 2017, Newmark completed its IPO of an aggregate of 23 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock. Prior to the Newmark IPO, Newmark was our wholly owned subsidiary.\n \u2022 effect acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and other transactions; \nAs of December 31, 2019, our front-office headcount, including our insurance brokerage business, was 2,990 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, up 13% from 2,654 a year ago. Our total technology headcount increased by 8% year-on-year to 691, related primarily to our newer Fenics stand-alone Fully Electronic offerings. Compared to the prior year, average revenue per front-office employee, including our insurance brokerage business, for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 7% to $703 thousand from $756 thousand. All figures mentioned in the previous two paragraphs exclude Newmark.\nPossible Restructuring\nInterest income decreased by $0.2 million, or 1.1%, to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES and estimates\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $126.3 million, or 12.6%, to $1,127.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The main drivers of this increase were the acquisitions of Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, and Ginga Petroleum, as well as the impact of higher brokerage revenues on variable compensation.\nThe table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nThe combination of more market acceptance of Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution and our competitive advantage in terms of technology and experience has contributed to our strong gains in electronically traded products. We continue to invest in Hybrid and Fully Electronic technology broadly across our product categories, not only launching existing product pools but also launching new platforms with market leading protocols and functionality, which we believe will be game changing in the sector. Fenics has exhibited strong growth over the past several years, and we believe that this growth has outpaced the wholesale brokerage industry as a whole. We expect this trend to accelerate as we convert more of our Voice and Hybrid brokerage into Fully Electronic brokerage across our Fenics platform.\nThe increase in brokerage revenues was primarily driven by increases in revenues from rates, FX, equities, insurance, and other asset classes, and energy and commodities.\n \u2022 develop new or enhanced products, services and markets; and \nOur brokerage revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased by $51.1 million, or 14.3%, to $409.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by the acquisition of Ed Broking.\nBrokerage Revenues\nCertain LPUs are granted exchangeability into shares of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock or are redeemed in connection with the grant of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock issued; BGC Class A common stock is issued on a one-for-one basis, and Newmark Class A common stock is issued based on the number of LPUs exchanged or redeemed multiplied by the then Exchange Ratio. At the time exchangeability is granted or shares of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock are issued, we recognize an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred compensation expense of $100.9 million, $150.1 million and $176.5 million, respectively.\n</table>\nOn December 16, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which CF&Co may make offers and sales of our 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 and 3.750% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which may occur from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any other of our affiliates, has any obligation to make a market in our securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice.\nInterest Expense\nIn addition, self-regulatory organizations, such as the FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the FCA, the SEC, and the CFTC require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not designed to specifically protect stockholders. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements.\nGFI Merger\nFully Electronic (Fenics) and Hybrid Execution\nThe initial carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes was $295.8 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.2 million. The carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $298.7 million.\nOther Income (Losses), Net\nOn March 13, 2015, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $28.2 million under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurred interest at a fixed rate of 3.70% per year and matured on March 13, 2019; therefore, there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 million outstanding related to this secured loan agreement. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2018 was $0.1 million.\nOther Income (Loss)\nOther Expenses\n Partnership units collectively include FPUs, LPUs, and Cantor units (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information). \nCommissions and Floor Brokerage\n Given the net loss during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, approximately 180.8 million potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 0.9 million potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included, on a weighted-average basis, approximately 0.9 million RSUs. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 15.8 million shares of contingent Class A common stock and LPUs were excluded from fully diluted EPS computations because the conditions for issuance had not been met by the end of the period. The contingent Class A common stock is recorded as a liability and included in Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2019. \n The components of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs are as follows (in thousands): \nThrough our software solutions business, we provide customized software to broaden distribution capabilities and provide electronic solutions to financial market participants. The software solutions business leverages our global infrastructure, software, systems, portfolio of intellectual property, and electronic trading expertise to provide customers with electronic marketplaces and exchanges and real-time auctions to enhance debt issuance and to customize trading interfaces. We take advantage of the scalability, flexibility and functionality of our electronic trading system to enable our customers to distribute products to their customers through online offerings and auctions, including private and reverse auctions, via our trading platform and global network. Using screen-based market solutions, customers are able to develop a marketplace, trade with their customers, issue debt, trade odd lots, access program trading interfaces and access our network and intellectual property. We provide option pricing and analysis tools that deliver price discovery that is supported with market data sourced from both our BGC and GFI trading systems.\nOur credit revenues increased by $14.5 million, or 5.0%, to $306.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to higher global volumes.\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in the U.S. GAAP guidance, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nThe table below represents the units redeemed and/or shares repurchased for cash and does not include units redeemed/cancelled in connection with the grant of shares of BGC Class A common stock nor the limited partnership interests exchanged for shares of BGC Class A common stock. The gross unit redemptions and share repurchases of BGC Class A common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except weighted-average price data):\nCertain of these LPUs entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount, generally in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These LPUs are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under the U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we recognize a liability for these units on our consolidated statements of financial condition as part of Accrued compensation\u201d for the amortized portion of the post-termination payment amount, based on the current fair value of the expected future cash payout. We amortize the post-termination payment amount, less an expected forfeiture rate, over the vesting period, and record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period in our consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d\nBalance Sheet\nInterest Expense\nOn October 5, 2018, Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund filed a putative derivative complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court, captioned Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund vs. Howard Lutnick, et al. (Case No. 2018-0722), alleging breaches of fiduciary duty against (i) the members of the Board, (ii) Howard Lutnick, CFGM, and Cantor as controlling stockholders of BGC, and (iii) Howard Lutnick as an officer of BGC. The complaint challenges the transactions by which BGC (i) completed the Berkeley Point acquisition from CCRE for $875 million and (ii) committed to invest $100 million for a 27% interest in Real Estate, L.P. (collectively, the Transaction\u201d). Among other things, the complaint alleges that (i) the price BGC paid in connection with the Transaction was unfair, (ii) the process leading up to the Transaction was unfair, and (iii) the members of the special committee of the Board were not independent. It seeks to recover for the Company unquantified damages, disgorgement of any payments received by defendants, and attorneys' fees.\nOn October 3, 2018, Mr. Lutnick donated an aggregate of 53,368 shares of BGC Class A common stock from his personal asset trust to a charitable foundation for which his spouse serves as a director. The Company repurchased the 53,368 shares from the charitable foundation at a price of $11.73 per share, which was the closing price of BGC Class A common stock on that date. The transaction was approved by the Audit Committee.\n\n\nThe second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nOur FX revenues decreased by $25.9 million, or 6.5%, to $370.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by lower global volumes and a decrease in market volatility.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes decreased by $16.7 million, or 17.9%, to $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of the Tax Act in 2017 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings partially offset by GILTI. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein for information related to our liquidity and capital resources.\nOther Revenues\nThe final phase of Basel III (unofficially called Basel IV\u201d) is a global prudential regulatory standard designed to make banks more resilient and increase confidence in the banking system. Its wide scope includes reviewing market, credit and operational risk along with targeted changes to leverage ratios. Basel IV includes updates to the calculation of bank capital requirements with the aim of making outcomes more comparable across banks globally. Most of the requirements are expected to be implemented by national and regional authorities by around 2022. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces.\nProfessional and Consulting Fees\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nITEM 7.\nThe first step involves comparing each reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment.\nOur securities settlement activities primarily represent deposits with clearing organizations. In addition, when advantageous, we may elect to facilitate the settlement of matched principal transactions by funding failed trades, which results in a temporary secured use of cash and is economically beneficial to us.\nThe $141.3 million decrease in our liquidity position from $552.1 million as of December 31, 2017 to $410.9 million as of December 31, 2018 was primarily related to our purchase of exchangeable limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings in the Investment in Newmark, cash paid with respect to various acquisitions throughout the year, our continued investment in revenue generating hires, and ordinary movements in working capital.\nOn January 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Micromega Securities, which operates in the South African fixed income, rates and FX markets.\nFX Volumes and Volatility\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs decreased by $39.5 million, or 19.2%, to $165.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in charges related to equity-based compensation, as well as a decrease in allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\nWe derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, the spread between the buy and sell prices on matched principal transactions, fees from related parties, data, software and post-trade services, and other revenues. See Note 3- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nThe following discussion of BGC Partners' financial condition and results of operations should be read together with BGC Partners' consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements, as well as the cautionary statements relating to forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, included in this report.\nOther Operating Expenses\nAs the above table indicates, our brokerage operations in the rates product category produce a significant percentage of our total brokerage revenues. We expect that revenues from our rates product brokerage operations will increase in absolute terms, but decline as a percentage of our overall revenues as we continue to invest in expanding in other asset classes.\nEmployee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain employees and partners, whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted. The distributions are treated as compensation expense when made and the proceeds are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates.\n The Company completed the calculation of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' earnings pursuant to the Tax Act and previously recorded a net cumulative tax expense of $25.0 million, net of foreign tax credits, with an election to pay the taxes over eight years with 40% to be paid in equal installments over the first five years and the remaining 60% to be paid in installments of 15%, 20% and 25% in years six, seven and eight, respectively. The cumulative remaining balance as of December 31, 2019 is $19.4 million. \nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $415.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents, and included in this amount was $286.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries.\nOther revenues increased by $7.1 million, to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Poten & Partners in November 2018, as well as a settlement of $2.5 million received and recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBefore our first quarter 2020 earnings call, we expect to submit a proposal to the Board and relevant committees with respect to converting our partnership into a corporation. Our current target is to be positioned to begin executing a conversion around the end of the third quarter of 2020, and expect to complete the execution around year end 2020. Any such restructuring would be subject to tax, accounting, regulatory, and other considerations and approvals.\nWe consider the following in analyzing changes in our liquidity.\nOn December 13, 2017, the Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement was amended and restated a second time to include prior standalone amendments and to make certain other changes related to the Separation. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement, among other things, reflects changes resulting from the division in the Separation of BGC Holdings into BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, including:\nSince mid-2016, the overall financial services industry has benefited from sustained economic growth, a lower unemployment rate, higher consumer spending, the modification or repeal of certain U.S. regulations, and higher investment income. In addition, the secular trend towards digitalization and electronification within the industry has contributed to higher overall volumes and transaction count in Fully Electronic execution. Looking ahead, concerns about the future trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU after Brexit, a slowdown in global growth driven by the outbreak of coronavirus in China, and an increase in trade protectionism are tempered by expectations of monetary and fiscal stimulus.\nIn addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain LPUs, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability or redemption in connection with the grant of shares of common stock to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange or redemption. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings are allocated to Preferred Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The Preferred Distribution is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership interests. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the indicated periods (in thousands). Results of any period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year and may, in certain periods, be affected by seasonal fluctuations in our business. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation.\n As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $15.1 million and $144.7 million, respectively, of Marketable securities on our balance sheet had been lent in a Securities loaned transaction and therefore are not included in this Liquidity Analysis. \nAs we continue to focus our efforts on converting Voice and Hybrid desks to Fully Electronic execution, net revenues in our higher margin Fully Electronic businesses across brokerage, data, software, and post-trade increased 12.2% to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Going forward, we expect Fenics to become an even more valuable part of BGC as it continues to grow. We continue to analyze how to optimally configure our Voice/Hybrid and Fully Electronic businesses.\nGoodwill\nIn February 2019, the Audit Committee authorized us to enter into a short-term services agreement with Cantor pursuant to which Cantor would be responsible for clearing, settling and processing certain transactions executed on behalf of customers in exchange for a 33% revenue share based on net transaction revenue and the payment by BGC of the fully allocated cost of certain salespersons related thereto.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur overall insurance brokerage business now includes Ed Broking, as well as our newly acquired aviation and space insurance brokerage business, whose producers are not yet generating meaningful revenue. Therefore, these newer insurance businesses are not yet up to scale. The pre-tax loss relating to our insurance brokerage business was $9.7 million and $18.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The corresponding prior year periods had a pre-tax loss of $2.8 million and pre-tax income of $5.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nOn July 31, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 which were issued in a private placement, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nBrokerage\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company completed the calculation of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' earnings pursuant to the Tax Act and previously recorded a net cumulative tax expense of $25.0 million, net of foreign tax credits. An installment election can be made to pay the taxes over eight years with 40% paid in equal installments over the first five years and the remaining 60% to be paid in installments of 15%, 20% and 25% in years six, seven and eight, respectively. The cumulative remaining balance as of December 31, 2019 is $19.4 million.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWe currently expect our overall insurance brokerage business to operate around breakeven for the next two years as we seek to double this division's current revenues. We also expect our overall investment to turn profitable and deliver margins in excess of 15% by 2022. This is similar to the trend in revenues and profitability of our former real estate services business, Newmark, over its first three years as part of BGC. We believe our insurance brokerage business is worth materially more than our investment and are actively considering ways to better express its value for the benefit of our investors.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, insurance brokerage revenues increased by 185.6% and 126.0% to $43.3 million and $155.8 million, respectively. Including interest income, total revenues associated with insurance brokerage increased by 186.5% and 127.7% to $44.0 million and $158.0 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nOn August 22, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured loan agreement with Itau Unibanco S.A. The credit agreement provides for short-term loans of up to $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million). The maturity date of the agreement is May 20, 2020. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the Brazilian Interbank offering rate plus 3.30%. As of December 31, 2019, there were $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million) of borrowings outstanding under the facility. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate was 7.8%.\nOur rates revenues, like the revenues for most of our products, are not fully dependent on market volumes and, therefore, do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This is largely because our Voice, Hybrid, and Fully Electronic desks in rates often have volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes.\nOn May 31, 2017, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $29.9 million under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.44% and matures on May 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $11.7 million and $19.2 million, respectively, outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 million. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2018 was $6.5 million.\nThe FX market is one of the largest financial markets in the world. FX transactions can either be undertaken in the spot market, in which one currency is sold and another is bought, or in the derivative market in which future settlement of the identical underlying currencies are traded. We provide full execution OTC brokerage services in most major currencies, including all G8 currencies, emerging market, cross and exotic options currencies.\nCertain of these LPUs entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d The liability for LPUs with a post-termination payout amount is included in Accrued compensation\u201d on our consolidated statements of financial condition.\nOn March 12, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Ginga Petroleum. Ginga Petroleum provides a comprehensive range of broking services for physical and derivative energy products, including naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, fuel oil, biofuels, middle distillates, petrochemicals and gasoline.\nOn June 6, 2017, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, the Company's stockholders approved the Company's Incentive Plan to approve the material terms of the performance goals under the Incentive Plan for compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including an amendment to those performance goals in order to broaden the stock price performance goal to include dividends and/or total stockholder return.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nOn June 28, 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets to Nasdaq, which purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the Fully Electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses, for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of Nasdaq is equal to or greater than $25 million. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company transferred the right to receive earn-out payments from Nasdaq to Newmark. Following the Spin-Off, the right to receive earn-out payments from Nasdaq remains with Newmark.\nMARKET SUMMARY\nAs part of our compensation plans, certain employees are granted LPUs in BGC Holdings which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, that are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such LPUs are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAnother key factor in the historical growth of the financial services industry has been the increase in the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most of these new securities and derivatives were not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increased the need for trading and required broker-assisted execution.\nGains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments\nSee Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nOn February 16, 2018, the Audit Committee authorized the purchase by Mr. Lutnick's retirement plan of up to $105,000 of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on the date of purchase. Pursuant to this authorization, 7,883 shares of BGC Class A common stock were purchased by the plan on February 26, 2018 at $13.17 per share, the closing price on the date of purchase.\nOn March 19, 2018, we entered into the BGC Credit Agreement with Cantor. The BGC Credit Agreement provides for each party and certain of its subsidiaries to issue loans to the other party or any of its subsidiaries in the lender's discretion in an aggregate principal amount up to $250.0 million outstanding at any time. The BGC Credit Agreement replaced the previous Credit Facility between BGC and an affiliate of Cantor, and was approved by the Audit Committee. On August 6, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the BGC Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate principal amount that can be loaned to the other party or any of its subsidiaries from $250.0 million to $400.0 million that can be outstanding at any time. The BGC Credit Agreement will mature on the earlier to occur of (a) March 19, 2020, after which the maturity date of the BGC Credit Agreement will continue to be extended for successive one-year periods unless prior written notice of non-extension is given by a lending party to a borrowing party at least six months in advance of such renewal date and (b) the termination of the BGC Credit Agreement by either party pursuant to its terms. The outstanding amounts under the BGC Credit Agreement will bear interest for any rate period at a per annum rate equal to the higher of BGC's or Cantor's short-term borrowing rate in effect at such time plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings by BGC or Cantor outstanding under this Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had over 2,900 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel across our businesses.\nSelling and promotion expense increased by $6.9 million, or 11.0%, to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of total revenues, selling and promotion remained relatively unchanged across the two periods.\nBrokerage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $143.2 million. Our brokerage revenue growth was led by a 25.6% improvement in our energy and commodities business, which was driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, partially offset by the sale of CSC Commodities. Revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased 14.3% primarily due to the acquisition of Ed Broking. Our insurance brokerage revenues increased 126% for the full year 2019, largely due to the acquisition of Ed Broking. Because of the significant growth of this business, we expect to break out insurance brokerage revenues separately from equities and other asset classes in the next quarter. We believe our insurance brokerage business is worth materially more than our investment and are actively considering ways to better express its value for the benefit of our investors. Within our Fenics business, net revenues were up 6.4%. Our Fully Electronic brokerage revenues increased 4.4%, which was primarily led by a 13.7% increase in our Fenics rates business, while our revenues from our high margin data, software, and post-trade business increased 12.2%. As our stand-alone Fenics offerings continue to gain traction, we convert Voice and Hybrid revenue to higher margin Fully Electronic execution, and as our recently added brokers and salespeople ramp up production, we expect the Company's revenues and profits to grow.\nA month later, on November 5, 2018, the same plaintiffs' firm filed an identical putative derivative complaint against the same defendants seeking the same relief on behalf of a second client, Northern California Pipe Trades Trust Funds. The cases have been consolidated into a single action, captioned In re BGC Partners, Inc. Derivative Litigation (Consolidated C.A. No. 2018-0722-AGB), and the complaint filed by Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund on October 5, 2018 was designated as the operative complaint.\nGUARANTEE AGREEMENT FROM CF&CO\nFees to Related Parties\nOther Income (loss) is primarily comprised of gains or losses related to fair value adjustments on investments carried under the alternative method. Other Income (loss) also includes realized and unrealized gains or losses related to sales and mark-to-market adjustments on Marketable securities and any related hedging transactions when applicable. Acquisition-related fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and miscellaneous recoveries are also included in Other Income (loss).\n\nWe earn fees from related parties for technology services and software licenses and for certain administrative and back-office services we provide to affiliates, particularly from Cantor. These administrative and back-office services include office space, utilization of fixed assets, accounting services, operational support, human resources, legal services and information technology.\nSelling and promotion expense increased by $12.3 million, or 17.7%, to $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, and Ginga Petroleum.\nOn May 27, 2016, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes. The 5.125% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.125% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per year, payable in cash on May 27 and November 27 of each year, commencing November 27, 2016. The 5.125% Senior Notes will mature on May 27, 2021. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time for cash at certain make-whole\u201d redemption prices (as set forth in the Indenture). If a Change of Control Triggering Event\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of its notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. Cantor purchased $15.0 million of such senior notes and still holds such notes as of December 31, 2019.\nGain (Loss) on divestiture and sale of investments represent the gain or loss we recognize for the divestiture or sale of our investments.\nRates volumes in particular are influenced by market volumes and, in certain instances, volatility. Historically low and negative interest rates across the globe have significantly reduced the overall trading appetite for rates products. As a result of central bank policies and actions, as well as continued expectations of low inflation rates, many sovereign bonds continue to trade at or close to negative yields, especially in real terms. In addition, also weighing on yields and rates volumes are global central bank quantitative easing programs. The programs depress rates volumes because they entail central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open market - particularly longer-dated instruments - in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge, thus lowering rates volumes across cash and derivatives markets industry-wide. Major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, and Swiss National Bank continue to maintain historically low interest rates through quantitative easing programs, keeping key short-term interest rates low, or a combination of both. Even with the Federal Reserve unwind, the overall dollar value of balance sheets of the G-4 (the U.S., Eurozone, Japan, and U.K.) is expected to remain high as a percentage of G-4 GDP over the near term. Largely as a result of quantitative easing and expectations of continued low inflation, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was (0.19)% and the yield on Japan's 10-year bond was (0.02)% as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.\nRevenues\n\n Long-term debt and collateralized borrowings reflect long-term borrowings of $300.0 million of the 5.125% Senior Notes due on May 27, 2021 (the $300.0 million represents the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $298.7 million), $450.0 million of the 5.375% Senior Notes due on July 24, 2023 (the $450.0 million represents the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $445.2 million), $300.0 million of the 3.750% Senior Notes due October 1, 2024 (the $300.0 million represents the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $296.1 million), $70.0 million of borrowings under the committed unsecured senior Revolving Credit Agreement due February 26, 2021 (the $70.0 million represents \nOur rates business is focused on government debt, futures and currency, and both listed and OTC interest rate derivatives, which are among the largest, most global and most actively traded markets. The main drivers of these markets are global macroeconomic forces such as growth, inflation, government budget policies and new issuances.\n\n \u2022 an adjustment of the exchange mechanism between the Newmark IPO and the Distribution so that one exchangeable BGC Holdings unit together with a number of exchangeable Newmark Holdings units equal to 0.4545 divided by the Newmark Holdings Exchange Ratio as of such time, must be exchanged in order to receive one share of BGC Class A common stock; and \nShort-term Borrowings\n the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the committed unsecured senior Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $68.9 million), $11.7 million of collateralized borrowings due May 31, 2021, $13.2 million of collateralized borrowings due April 8, 2023, and $8.8 million of collateralized borrowings due April 19, 2023. See Note 18- Notes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these obligations, including timing of payments and compliance with debt covenants. \nIn recent years, there has been significant consolidation among the interdealer-brokers and wholesale brokers with which we compete. In addition to our 2015 acquisition of GFI, Tullett and ICAP announced in November 2015 an agreement whereby Tullett would purchase the vast majority of ICAP's global Voice/Hybrid broking, as well as portions of its information businesses. Following the completion of this deal in December 2016, ICAP changed its corporate name to NEX, and Tullett changed its name to TP ICAP plc. CME announced in March 2018 that it had agreed to acquire NEX and completed the acquisition in November 2018. We expect to continue to compete with the electronic markets, post-trade and information businesses of NEX, that are part of CME now, through the various offerings on our Fenics platform. We will also continue to compete with TP ICAP across various Voice/Hybrid brokerage marketplaces as well as via Fenics. There has also been significant consolidation among smaller non-public wholesale brokers, including our acquisitions of RP Martin, Heat Energy Group, Remate Lince and Sunrise Brokers Group. We view the recent consolidation in the industry favorably, as we expect it to provide additional operating leverage to our businesses in the future.\nHIRING AND ACQUISITIONS\n\nOur average revenue per front-office employee has historically declined year-over-year for the period immediately following significant headcount increases, and the additional brokers and salespeople generally achieve significantly higher productivity levels in their second or third year with the Company. Excluding our insurance brokerage business, as of December 31, 2019, our front-office headcount was 2,570 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, up 1% from 2,553 a year ago. Compared to the prior year, average revenue per front-office employee for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 1% to $750 thousand from $760 thousand. On a stand-alone basis, our total insurance brokerage headcount increased by 122% to 591 from 266 a year ago.\nChanges in shares of the Company's Class A common stock outstanding were as follows (in thousands):\nFees to Related Parties\nWe have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners, whereby these individuals receive loans which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their LPUs or may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan. From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements.\nRates Volumes and Volatility\nIndustry Consolidation\nCollectively, our newer Fenics offerings, such as the five listed above, are not yet fully up to scale, and are not yet generating significant revenues. The net loss relating to investment in these new products and services was more than $55 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect the net loss relating to these investments in Fenics offerings to improve by $15 million in 2020 and for the net loss to be approximately $40 million, and for these newer businesses to break even during 2021. Over time, we expect these new products and services to become profitable, high-margin businesses as their scale and revenues increase, all else equal. We believe that our newer Fenics offerings have created significant shareholder value.\n \u2022 an apportionment of the existing economic attributes (including, among others, capital accounts and post-termination payments) of each BGC Holdings limited partnership interests outstanding immediately prior to the Separation between such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit and the fraction of a Newmark Holdings LPU issued in the Separation in respect of such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit, based on the relative value of BGC and Newmark as of after the Newmark IPO; \nBecause revenue per broker is not a widely used or relevant statistic for the insurance brokerage industry, BGC will provide statistics with respect to front-office staff excluding this business beginning in the first quarter of 2020.\nFees from Related Parties\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nExpenses\nIn November 2008, we entered into a clearing capital agreement with Cantor to clear U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities transactions on our behalf. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, so long as Cantor is providing clearing services to us, Cantor shall be entitled to request from us, and we shall post as soon as practicable, cash or other property acceptable to Cantor in the amount reasonably requested by Cantor under the clearing capital agreement. Cantor had not requested any cash or other property from us as collateral as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $315.6 million and $216.9 million, respectively, and is included as Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net\u201d in our consolidated statements of financial condition. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $35.7 million, $13.0 million and $26.9 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of Compensation and employee benefits\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest expense decreased by $35.2 million, or 45.8%, to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense on the $300.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes, and the $112.5 million 8.125% Senior Notes, both of which were assumed by Newmark as part of the December 2017 Separation Agreement, as well as lower interest expense on the $240.0 million 8.375% Senior Notes which were repaid in July 2018. In addition, lower interest expense on the $575.0 million Senior Term Loan, and the $400.0 million credit facility, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on the $450.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 issued in July 2018.\n During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company redeemed 1.4 million LPUs at an aggregate redemption price of $8.0 million for a weighted-average price of $5.92 per unit and 0.1 million FPUs at an aggregate redemption price of $0.3 million for a weighted-average price of $5.64 per unit. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company redeemed approximately 9.2 million LPUs at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $116.5 million for a weighted-average price of $12.61 per unit and approximately 0.1 million FPUs at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $1.4 million for a weighted-average price of $12.86 per unit. The table above does not include units redeemed/cancelled in connection with the grant of 10.1 million and 6.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, nor the limited partnership interests exchanged for 4.4 million and 2.6 million shares of BGC Class A common stock during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nFor more information about these transactions, see Note 1- Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nEnergy and Commodities\nOur brokerage revenues from energy and commodities increased by $58.4 million, or 25.6%, to $286.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, as well as organic growth, partially offset by the sale of CSC Commodities.\nIn response to motions to dismiss filed by all defendants in December 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the operative complaint in February 2019, requesting that the Court allow them to supplement their allegations, which the Court granted. The amended complaint alleges the same purported breaches of fiduciary duty as the operative complaint, raises no new claims, and seeks identical relief, but includes additional allegations, including alleged reasons for plaintiffs' failure to make a demand on the Board, which was the basis of defendants' motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2019, all defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints, again on demand grounds. On September 30, 2019, the Court denied defendants' motions to dismiss, permitting the case to move forward into discovery. In its ruling, the Court determined that the amended complaint sufficiently pled that plaintiffs were not required to make demand on the Board in order to file a derivative suit, but did not make findings of fact with respect to the underlying merits of plaintiffs' allegations concerning the Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we had income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $138.1 million compared to income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $179.8 million in the year earlier period. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $166.4 million to $2,104.2 million primarily led by our energy and commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes, rates, and credit businesses.\nWe have continued to invest in our new Fenics stand-alone Fully Electronic offerings, which currently include:\nCertain LPUs are granted exchangeability into our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDERIVATIVE SUIT\nFX\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities. See Note 15- Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our investments in unconsolidated entities.\n5.375% Senior Notes\nOn November 28, 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement which replaced the existing committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement. The maturity date of the new Revolving Credit Agreement was November 28, 2020 and the maximum revolving loan balance has been reduced from $400.0 million to $350.0 million. Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus additional margin. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the new unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the maturity date was extended to February 26, 2021. There was no change to the interest rate or the maximum revolving loan balance. On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, pursuant to which, the maturity date was extended by two years to February 26, 2023. The size of the Revolving Credit Agreement, along with the interest rate on the borrowings therefrom, remained unchanged. As of December 31, 2019, there was $68.9 million of borrowings outstanding, net of deferred financing costs of $1.1 million, under the new unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement. The average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSee Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nOther Revenues\nThe Board and Audit Committee have authorized repurchases of BGC Class A common stock and redemptions of limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries. On August 1, 2018, the Company's Board and Audit Committee increased the Company's share repurchase and unit redemption authorization to $300.0 million, which may include purchases from Cantor, its partners or employees or other affiliated persons or entities. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $256.7 million remaining from its share repurchase and unit redemption authorization. From time to time, the Company may actively continue to repurchase shares and/or redeem units.\nRestricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per the U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates' customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 there was no net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries of $52.4 million.\nHistorically, our technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale financial intermediaries alike, even if overall Company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because automated and electronic trading efficiency allows the same number of employees to manage a greater volume of trades as the marginal cost of incremental trading activity falls. Over time, the conversion of exchange-traded and OTC markets to Fully Electronic trading has also led, on average, to volumes increasing by enough to offset commission declines, and thus often to similar or higher overall revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution, and we continually work with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies.\nFunding\n Hybrid is defined as transactions involving some element of electronic trading but executed by BGC's brokers, exclusive of voice-only transactions. Fully electronic involves customer-to-customer trades, free from broker execution. \nUNIT REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES-EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nWe earn other revenues from various sources, including underwriting and advisory fees.\nOur rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including global sovereign issuances, secondary trading and the hedging of these sovereign debt instruments. The amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains high by historical standards, and the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity was mixed during 2019. In addition, according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average daily volume of various U.S. Treasuries, excluding Treasury bills, among primary dealers was 7% higher in 2019 as compared to a year earlier. Additionally, interest rate derivative volumes were down 13% and up 4% at ICE and the CME, respectively, all according to company press releases. In comparison, our revenue from Fenics Fully Electronic rates increased 13.7%, while our overall rates revenues were up 8.2% as compared to a year earlier to $594.9 million.\nExpenses\nWe provide our brokerage services in a wide range of credit instruments, including asset-backed securities, convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit derivatives and high yield bonds.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, external data providers have restated the historical prices of BGC Class A common stock (BGCP). As such, the nominal prices listed in the footnotes above may not match the historical prices listed on such data services following the Spin-Off.\nCredit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm's competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlooks could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.\n\nProfessional and consulting fees increased by $8.1 million, or 9.6%, to $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by fees attributed to the acquisitions of Ed Broking and Poten & Partners, and an increase in legal fees, which was partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees, notably with regards to the implementation of MiFID II during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFees from Related Parties\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION-INCENTIVE PLAN\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n \u2022 Lucera, which is our software-defined network, offering the trading community direct connectivity to each other; and \n \u2022 Capitalab's Nikkei 225 options compression service, which is in partnership with the Singapore Exchange. \nAs part of our cash management process, we may enter into tri-party reverse repurchase agreements and other short-term investments, some of which may be with Cantor. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no reverse repurchase agreements outstanding.\nCommissions and floor brokerage expense increased by $18.8 million, or 43.5%, to $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This line item tends to move in line with brokerage revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, there was a gain of $18.4 million as a result of the sale of CSC Commodities. We had no gains or losses from divestitures or sale of investments in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues\nWe previously offered real estate services through our publicly traded subsidiary, Newmark (NASDAQ: NMRK). On November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of Newmark (see Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off\u201d for more information).\nUnder rules adopted by the CFTC, all foreign introducing brokers engaging in transactions with U.S. persons are required to register with the NFA and either meet financial reporting and net capital requirements on an individual basis or obtain a guarantee agreement from a registered Futures Commission Merchant. Our European-based brokers engage from time to time in interest rate swap transactions with U.S.-based counterparties, and therefore we are subject to the CFTC requirements. CF&Co has entered into guarantees on our behalf (and on behalf of GFI), and we are required to indemnify CF&Co for the amounts, if any, paid by CF&Co on our behalf pursuant to this arrangement. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded expenses of $125,000 with respect to these guarantees.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nOn April 8, 2019, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $15.0 million, under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.77% and matures on April 8, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, we had $13.2 million outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement. The net book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2019 was $8.1 million. Also, on April 19, 2019, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $10.0 million, under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.89% and matures on April 19, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, we had $8.8 million outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2019 was $5.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\nCertain LPUs have a stated vesting schedule and do not receive quarterly allocations of net income. Compensation expense related to these LPUs is recognized over the stated service period, and these units generally vest between two and five years. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred compensation expense related to these LPUs of $36.7 million, $11.4 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. This expense is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nLIQUIDITY\n As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $13.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively, of Marketable securities on our balance sheet had been lent in a Securities loaned transaction and, therefore, are not included in this Liquidity Analysis. \nOther Income (Losses), Net\nOther Income (Loss)\nOVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n Common stock consisted of Class A shares, Class B shares and contingent shares for which all necessary conditions have been satisfied except for the passage of time. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average number of Class A shares was 305.5 million and Class B shares was 45.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average number of Class A shares was 298.4 and Class B shares was 45.9 million. \nLIQUIDITY ANALYSIS\nClass B Common Stock\nClass A Common Stock\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step process as follows.\n5.125% Senior Notes\nBrokerage Revenues\nProfessional and consulting fees increased by $20.7 million, or 32.7%, to $84.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in consulting services in 2018.\nFees to related parties decreased by $0.8 million, or 4.0%, to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Fees to related parties are allocations paid to Cantor for administrative and support services (such as accounting, occupancy, and legal).\nOn January 12, 2016, we completed our acquisition of GFI, a leading intermediary and provider of trading technologies and support services to the global OTC and listed markets, via the GFI Merger. GFI serves institutional clients in operating electronic and hybrid markets for cash and derivative products across multiple asset classes.\nGains (losses) on equity method investments decreased by $3.3 million, to a gain of $4.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to a gain of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro-rata share of the net gains or losses on investments over which we have significant influence, but which we do not control.\nThe majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, broker bonuses based on broker production, guaranteed bonuses, other discretionary bonuses, and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of brokers, salespeople, executives and other administrative support. The majority of our brokers receive a base salary and a formula bonus based primarily on a pool of brokers' production for a particular product or sales desk, as well as on the individual broker's performance. Members of our sales force receive either a base salary or a draw on commissions. Less experienced salespeople typically receive base salaries and bonuses.\nWe offer our brokerage services in seven broad product categories: rates, credit, FX, energy & commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes. The chart below details brokerage revenues by product category and by Voice/Hybrid versus Fully Electronic (in thousands):\nFenics Market Data is a supplier of real-time, tradable, indicative, end-of-day and historical market data. Our market data product suite includes fixed income, interest rate derivatives, credit derivatives, FX, FX options, money markets, energy and equity derivatives and structured market data products and services. The data are sourced from the Voice, Hybrid and Fully Electronic broking operations, as well as the market data operations, including BGC, GFI and RP Martin, among others. It is made available to financial professionals, research analysts and other market participants via direct data feeds and BGC-hosted FTP environments, as well as via information vendors such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, ICE Data Services, QUICK Corp., and other select specialist vendors.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOn March 27, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees authorized the purchase by the Company from Stephen M. Merkel of up to 250,000 shares of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on March 26, 2019. Pursuant to this authorization, 233,172 shares of BGC Class A common stock were purchased by the Company on March 27, 2019 at $5.30 per share, the closing price on March 26, 2019.\nWe provide brokerage services in a range of markets for equity products, including cash equities, equity derivatives (both listed and OTC), equity index futures and options on equity products as well as insurance products.\nData, software and post-trade revenues increased by $10.6 million, or 19.5%, to $65.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by new business contracts in 2018.\nTotal expenses increased $205.8 million to $2,021.6 million, primarily due to a $118.9 million increase in non-compensation expenses driven by the impact of acquisitions; expenses related to the Company's previously disclosed settlements with the CFTC and the NYAG; interest expense associated with increased borrowing; and the Company's increased investment in technology. The increase in non-compensation expenses was also impacted by rent during the build-out of BGC's new U.K.-based headquarters, which was recently completed. Compensation expenses increased by $86.8 million, which was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions.\nFrom 2014 through 2016, the FASB issued several accounting standard updates, which together comprise ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company began recording its financial results to conform to ASC 606. ASC 606 does not currently materially impact the results of BGC. The consolidated Company has elected to adopt the guidance using the modified retrospective approach to ASC 606, under which the consolidated Company applied the new standard only to new contracts initiated on or after January 1, 2018 and recorded the transition adjustments as part of Total equity\u201d.\nThe Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement also removes certain classes of BGC Holdings units that are no longer outstanding, and permits the general partner of BGC Holdings to determine the total number of authorized BGC Holdings units. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement was approved by the Audit Committee.\nOur brokerage revenues from rates increased by $45.1 million, or 8.2%, to $594.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in rates revenues was primarily driven by higher global volumes and improvement in our Fully Electronic rates business, which was a result of our continued investment in technology and the ongoing conversion of our businesses to more profitable Fully Electronic execution.\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries increased by $58.3 million to $52.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in earnings.\nCredit Volumes\nThe initial carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes was $108.7 million, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million. On December 13, 2017, Newmark OpCo assumed all of the BGC U.S. OpCo's rights and obligations under the 2042 Promissory Note. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the Company in full for the 2042 Promissory Note, and the Company subsequently repaid the 8.125% Senior Notes on September 5, 2018.\nWe incur income tax expenses or benefit based on the location, legal structure and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the UBT in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the partners (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d for discussion of partnership interests), rather than the partnership entity. The Company's consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes.\nPURCHASE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS\nEquity-Based Compensation and Allocations of Net Income to Limited Partnership Units and FPUs\nCommunications\nDiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2019\nWe earn revenues from our brokerage services on both an agency and matched principal basis. In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. Principal transaction revenues are primarily derived from matched principal transactions, whereby revenues are earned on the spread between the buy and the sell price of the brokered security, commodity or derivative. Customers either see the buy or sell price on a screen or are given this information over the phone. The brokerage fee is then added to the buy or sell price, which represents the spread we earn as principal transactions revenues. On a limited basis, we enter into unmatched principal transactions to facilitate a customer's execution needs for transactions initiated by such customers. We also provide market data products for selected financial institutions.\nBGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October 2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January 22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for made available to trade\u201d products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also own ELX, which became a dormant contract market on July 1, 2017.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in the U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of our entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to UBT in the City of New York. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d for a discussion of partnership interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners' tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe increase in total brokerage revenues was primarily driven by increases in revenues from energy and commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes, rates, and credit, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from FX.\nWe and Cantor have agreed that any shares of BGC Class B common stock issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of BGC Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of Cantor units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the Cantor entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of BGC Class B Stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of Cantor units.\nOn September 8, 2017, we entered into the Term Loan. The Term Loan provided for loans of up to $575.0 million. The maturity date of the Term Loan was September 8, 2019. On November 22, 2017, we and Newmark entered into an amendment to the Term Loan. Pursuant to the Term Loan amendment and effective as of December 13, 2017, Newmark assumed the obligations of the Company as borrower under the Term Loan. There was no change in the maturity date or interest rate. As of December 31, 2017, Newmark had $270.7 million borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the outstanding balance of $270.7 million at which point the facility was terminated. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan.\nOur results from continuing operations exclude the results of Newmark for all periods due to the Spin-Off. During the year ended December 31, 2019, BGC's revenues increased 8.6%, to $2,104.2 million. This growth was largely due to an increase in brokerage revenues, which were up by 7.8% to $1,967.7 million. In addition, our data, software, and post-trade revenues increased by 12.2% from a year ago to $73.2 million. Income from operations before income taxes decreased by $41.7 million to $138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn October 11, 2019, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 24, 2019. On October 28, 2019, BGC launched an exchange offer in which holders of the 3.750% Senior Notes, issued in a private placement on September 27, 2019 may exchange such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. The exchange offer closed on December 9, 2019 at which point the initial 3.750% Senior Notes were exchanged for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nThe FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the U.K. The FCA's objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the monetization of 760,797 PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick (which at an average determination price of $6.57 per share on such date, had a value of $5,000,000). On February 1, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a modification which consisted of the following: (i) the right to exchange 376,651 non-exchangeable PSUs held by Mr. Lutnick into 376,651 non-exchangeable HDUs (which, based on the closing price of BGC Class A common stock of $6.21 per share on such date, had a value of $2,339,000); and (ii) the right to exchange for cash 463,969 non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick, for a payment of $2,661,000 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nOur balance sheet and business model are not capital intensive. Our assets consist largely of cash, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our business. Longer-term capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and potential capital investment opportunities. Total assets as of December 31, 2019 were $3.9 billion, an increase of 14.1% as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets was driven primarily by increases in Cash segregated under regulatory requirements, Accrued commissions and other receivables, net and less liquid assets, including ROU assets for leases. We maintain a significant portion of our assets in Cash and cash equivalents and Securities owned, with our liquidity (which we define as Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements) as of December 31, 2019 of $473.2 million. See Liquidity Analysis\u201d below for a further discussion of our liquidity. Our Securities owned were $57.5 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $58.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Our Marketable securities decreased to $14.2 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $32.1 million as of December 31, 2018. We did not have any Reverse repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We had Securities loaned of $13.9 million and no Repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had Securities loaned of $15.1 million and Repurchase agreements of $1.0 million.\nOn June 26, 2012, we issued an aggregate of $112.5 million principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2042. The 8.125% Senior Notes were senior unsecured obligations. The 8.125% Senior Notes were redeemable for cash, in whole or in part, on or after June 26, 2017, at our option, at any time and from time to time, until maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date. The 8.125% Senior Notes were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BGCA.\u201d We used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. In connection with the issuance of the 8.125% Senior Notes, the Company lent the proceeds of the 8.125% Senior Notes to BGC U.S. OpCo, and BGC U.S. OpCo issued the 2042 Promissory Note.\nOn June 5, 2015, we entered into the Exchange Agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold BGC Class B common stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of BGC Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of BGC Class B common stock. Such shares of BGC Class B common stock, which currently can be acquired upon the exchange of Cantor units owned in BGC Holdings, are already included in our fully diluted share count and will not increase Cantor's current maximum potential voting power in the common equity. The Exchange Agreement enabled the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of BGC Class B common stock that they were already entitled to acquire without having to exchange its Cantor units in BGC Holdings. The Audit Committee and Board have determined that it was in the best interests of us and our stockholders to approve the Exchange Agreement because it will help ensure that Cantor retains its Cantor units in BGC Holdings, which is the same partnership in which our partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees. On November 23, 2018, in the Class B Issuance, BGC issued 10,323,366 shares of BGC Class B common stock to Cantor and 712,907 shares of BGC Class B common stock to CFGM, an affiliate of Cantor, in each case in exchange for shares of BGC Class A common stock from Cantor and CFGM, respectively, on a one-to-one basis pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B issuance was exempt from the Securities Act. Following this exchange, Cantor and its affiliates only have the right to exchange under the Exchange Agreement up to an aggregate of 23,613,420 shares of BGC Class A common stock, now owned or subsequently acquired, or its Cantor units in BGC Holdings, into shares of BGC Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2019, Cantor and CFGM do not own any shares of BGC Class A common stock.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOn January 12, 2016, we completed the two-step GFI Merger. The GFI Merger allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33% of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did not already own. Following the closing of the GFI Merger, BGC and its affiliates owned 100% of the outstanding shares of GFI's common stock.\nInterest Income\nGains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments\nNet Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nSince 2017, our acquisitions have included Besso, Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, Ginga Petroleum and several smaller acquisitions.\nDue largely to the impacts of the global financial crises of 2008-2009, our businesses had faced more challenging market conditions from 2009 until the second half of 2016. Accommodative monetary policies were enacted by several major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, in response to the global financial crises. These policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across many of the financial markets in which we operate. The global credit markets also faced structural issues, such as increased bank capital requirements under Basel III. Consequently, these factors contributed to lower trading volumes in our rates and credit asset classes across most geographies in which we operated.\nThe table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nOur rates revenues increased by $38.9 million, or 7.6%, to $549.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in rates revenues reflected strong improvement in our Fully Electronic rates business, which was a result of our continued investment in technology and the ongoing conversion of our businesses to more profitable Fully Electronic execution.\nCantor has the right to purchase limited partnership interests (Cantor units) from BGC Holdings upon redemption of non-exchangeable FPUs redeemed by BGC Holdings upon termination or bankruptcy of the Founding/Working Partner. In addition, pursuant to Article Eight, Section 8.08, of the Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement (previously the sixth amendment) and Article Eight, Section 8.08, of the Newmark Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement, where either current, terminating, or terminated partners are permitted by the Company to exchange any portion of their FPUs and Cantor consents to such exchangeability, the Company shall offer to Cantor the opportunity for Cantor to purchase the same number of new exchangeable limited partnership interests (Cantor units) in BGC Holdings at the price that Cantor would have paid for the FPUs had the Company redeemed them. Any such Cantor units purchased by Cantor are currently exchangeable for up to 23,613,420 shares of BGC Class B common stock or, at Cantor's election or if there are no such additional shares of BGC Class B common stock, shares of BGC Class A common stock, in each case on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments).\nPrimarily in the U.S., we pay fees to Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support services, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from Cantor in the future. We incur commissions and floor brokerage fees for clearing, brokerage and other transactional expenses for clearing and settlement services. We also incur various other normal operating expenses.\n \u2022 Fenics GO, our new electronic trading platform, which provides live, real-time and tradeable two-way electronic liquidity for exchange-listed futures and options, such as Eurex EURO STOXX 50 Index Options, NIKKEI 225, and related Delta One strategies. Fenics GO recently added Citadel Securities, who joined IMC, Maven Securities, and Optiver as electronic liquidity providers; \n \u2022 Our expanded Fenics FX platforms, including MidFX, Spot, FX Options, and non-deliverable and FX forwards; \nCommissions and floor brokerage expense increased by $1.7 million, or 2.8%, to $63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This line item tends to move in line with brokerage revenues.\nEQUITY\nUnsecured Senior Revolving Credit Agreement\nOur liquidity analysis includes a comparison of our Consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for Consolidated net income from discontinued operations, net of tax and certain non-cash items (e.g., Equity-based compensation) as presented on the cash flow statement. Dividends and distributions are payments made to our holders of common shares and limited partnership interests and are related to earnings from prior periods. These timing differences will impact our cash flows in a given period.\nBGC, BGC Partners, BGC Trader, GFI, GFI Ginga, CreditMatch, Fenics, Fenics.com, Sunrise Brokers, Besso, Ed Broking, Poten & Partners, RP Martin, kACE2, EMBonds, Capitalab, Swaptioniser, CBID and Lucera are trademarks/service marks, and/or registered trademarks/service marks of BGC Partners, Inc. and/or its affiliates.\n Short-term borrowings reflects approximately $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million) of borrowing under the Company's committed unsecured loan agreement. See Note 18- Notes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\u201d for more information regarding this obligation. \nCommissions and Floor Brokerage\nVolume is driven by a number of factors, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, price volatility of financial instruments, macro-economic conditions, creation and adoption of new products, regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. Historically, increased price volatility has often increased the demand for hedging instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker.\nDiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2018\nOn November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of the shares of Newmark Class A and Class B common stock held by us to our stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date through a special pro-rata stock dividend pursuant to which shares of Newmark Class A common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of BGC Class A common stock and shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of BGC Class B common stock (which holders of BGC Class B common stock were Cantor and another entity controlled by our CEO, Howard W. Lutnick). Following the Spin-Off, BGC no longer holds any shares of Newmark.\n\nCREDIT RATINGS\nBelow is a brief analysis of the market and industry volumes for some of our products, including our overall Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution activities.\nRegulation\nInterest Income\nSee Note 3- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these critical accounting policies and other significant accounting policies.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs decreased by $28.2 million, or 12.1%, to $205.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in changes related to exchangeability and issuances of common stock.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company did not issue any shares of BGC Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 45,884,380 shares of BGC Class B common stock outstanding.\nOther expenses decreased by $5.8 million, or 8.3%, to $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily related to lower costs associated with acquisitions in 2018 and a decrease in impairment charges and other provisions.\nWe are a leading global brokerage and financial technology company servicing the global financial markets.\nGrowth Drivers\nJOINT SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CANTOR\nFees from related parties decreased by $3.0 million, or 11.1%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 respond to competitive pressures. \n3.750% Senior Notes\n \u2022 Fenics UST, which generated volume growth of approximately 230% year-on-year in December 2019. This compares with a decline of 18% for overall primary dealer U.S. Treasury volumes. Primary dealer volumes are based on data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Over the same timeframe, Fenics UST increased its market share of CLOB trading from approximately 2% to nearly 10% and is now the second largest CLOB platform for U.S. Treasuries. CLOB market share is based on data from Greenwich Associates for the U.S. Treasury volumes of Fenics UST, CME BrokerTec, Nasdaq Fixed Income, and Dealerweb. Including these CLOB platforms as well as the volumes of platforms using other fully electronic U.S. Treasury trading protocols, Fenics UST increased its market share from 1.3% to 5.4% year-on-year in December 2019, per Greenwich Associates. \nThe fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of BGC Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards' vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest income increased by $3.9 million, or 27.2%, to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on deposits and an increase in dividend income.\nFor the purposes of this document and subsequent SEC filings, all of our Fully Electronic businesses are referred to as Fenics. The Fenics business includes our group of electronic brands offering a number of market infrastructure and connectivity services, Fully Electronic marketplaces, and the Fully Electronic brokerage of certain products that also may trade via Voice and Hybrid execution. The full suite of Fenics offerings include market data and related information services, Fully Electronic brokerage, compression and other post-trade services, analytics related to financial instruments and markets, and other financial technology solutions.\nMiFID II is intended to help improve the functioning of the EU single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards. By design, therefore, it is intended that EU member states should have very similar regulatory regimes in relation to the matters addressed to MiFID. MiFID II has also introduced a new regulated execution venue category known as an OTF that captures much of the Voice-and Hybrid-oriented trading in EU. Much of our existing EU derivatives and fixed income execution business now take place on OTFs. Brexit may impact future market structures and MiFID II rulemaking and implementation due to potential changes in mutual passporting between the U.K. and EU member states.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nEnergy and commodities volumes were generally higher during 2019 compared with the year earlier. According to the Futures Industry Association, the total contracts traded in energy and commodities futures were up 14% in 2019 compared to the previous year. Similarly, total contracts traded in energy and commodities options were up 16% over the same period. In comparison, BGC's energy and commodities revenues increased by 25.6% to $286.6 million, which was driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, as well as organic growth, and partially offset by the sale of CSC.\nOn November 7, 2016, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 624,762 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 141,523 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $560,190, Cantor purchased 141,523 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $560,190. In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, on November 7, 2016, Cantor purchased 483,239 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $1,796,367 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange for 483,239 founding partner units. As a result of the Newmark IPO and the related Separation and Distribution Agreement, the aggregate exchangeable limited partnership units represent 624,762 and 283,983 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, respectively.\n5.375% Senior Notes due 2023\nFully electronic volume, including new products, was $25.0 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $23.2 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our hybrid volume for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $275.9 trillion, compared to $308.8 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe cash portion of our credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance, while both the cash and credit derivatives sides of this business are impacted by sovereign and corporate issuance. The global credit derivative market turnover has declined over the last few years due to the introduction of rules and regulations around the clearing of credit derivatives in the U.S. and elsewhere, along with non-uniform regulation across different geographies. In addition, many of our large bank customers continue to reduce their inventory of bonds and other credit products in order to comply with Basel III and other international financial regulations. During 2019, primary dealer average daily volume for corporate bonds (excluding commercial paper) was up by 11% according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Total notional traded credit derivatives as reported by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association - a reflection of the OTC derivatives market - were down by 12%, from a year earlier. In comparison, our overall credit revenues were up by 5.0% to $306.7 million.\nAs described earlier in this document, on November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of Newmark. (See Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off\u201d above for more information). As set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Newmark assumed certain BGC indebtedness and repaid such indebtedness. (See Notes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\u201d below for more information).\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were 1,749,347 FPUs in BGC Holdings remaining, which the partnerships had the right to redeem or exchange and with respect to which Cantor had the right to purchase an equivalent number of Cantor units.\nIn addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. For example, in Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC, GFI (HK) Securities LLC and Sunrise Broker (Hong Kong) Limited are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) Pty Limited and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited's Tokyo branch and BGC Capital Markets Japan LLC's Tokyo Branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, and GFI Group Pte Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets & Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators. In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC Brokers L.P. is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements imposed upon it by local regulators.\nNet Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nOther Revenues\nInterest Income\nThe U.K. and EU are currently negotiating a trade deal which, once signed, should determine the new bilateral trade relationship going forward. Given the short time period involved, it is not certain that such trade deal will be sufficiently comprehensive to encompass financial services. In case no new trade deal (or one incorporating financial services) is in place by the end of the transition period, absent mitigating legislative measures by individual EU member states, the trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU would be solely based on World Trade Organization terms. This could hinder current levels of mutual market access. While other trade deals are being considered, for example between the U.K. and the U.S., these may also prove challenging to negotiate and are unlikely to replace or compensate for a reduction, if any, in U.K. and EU trade at least in the short term. Further, the terms of a U.K. and EU trade deal may adversely impact the negotiation and terms of such other deals and vice versa.\nSelling and Promotion\nUnsecured Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement\nOur liquidity and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements of our operating subsidiaries. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in civil and criminal judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, enhanced oversight, remediation, or other relief.\n8.375% Senior Notes\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, which includes the global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, provision. This provision requires inclusion in the Company's U.S. income tax return the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected to treat taxes associated with the GILTI provision using the Period Cost Method and thus has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences under this regime.\nThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nOn August 23, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Itau Unibanco S.A. The credit agreement provides for an intra-day overdraft credit line up to $12.4 million (BRL 50.0 million). The maturity date of the agreement is March 13, 2020. This facility bears a fee of 1.00% per year. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.\n8.125% Senior Notes\nAs a wholesale intermediary in the financial services industry, our businesses are driven primarily by overall industry volumes in the markets in which we broker, the size and productivity of our front-office headcount (including brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel), regulatory issues, and the percentage of our revenues we are able to generate by Fully Electronic means.\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries decreased by $6.2 million, or 17.1%, to $30.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Lynn with respect to 750,308 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $5.17 per share on such date, had a value of $3,879,092) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $3.894 per unit) of 287,888 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $1,120,909 for taxes. On February 22, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Lynn with respect to an additional 43,131 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $6.26 per share on such date, had a value of $270,000) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $4.1239 per unit) of 25,461 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $105,000 for taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has issued 0.3 million shares of its Class A common stock and paid $14.6 million in cash related to such contingent payments.\nRegistration Statements\nOn January 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Ed Broking, an independent Lloyd's of London insurance broker with a strong reputation across accident and health, aerospace, cargo, energy, financial and political risks, marine, professional and executive risks, property and casualty, specialty and reinsurance. Ed Broking has become part of the Company's overall insurance brokerage business.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated statements of financial condition, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nThese subsidiaries may also be prohibited from repaying the borrowings of their parents or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to their parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions, in each case, that result in a significant reduction in their regulatory capital position without prior notification or approval from their principal regulator. See Note 22- Regulatory Requirements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our regulatory requirements.\nSummary of Results from Continuing Operations\nOther Income (Loss)\nOn September 27, 2019, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 3.750% Senior Notes. The 3.750% Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The 3.750% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.750% per annum, payable on each April 1 and October 1, commencing April 1, 2020. The initial carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes was $296.1 million, net of discount and debt issuance costs of $3.9 million, of which $0.2 million are underwriting fees payable to CF&Co and $36 thousand are underwriting fees payable to CastleOak Securities, L.P. The issuance costs will be amortized as interest expense and the carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes was $296.1 million as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our public long-term credit ratings and associated outlooks are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have issued and sold 17,401,431 shares of BGC Class A common stock (or $209.8 million) under the March 2018 Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, we had sold all 20 million shares of BGC Class A common stock pursuant to each of the November 2014 Sales Agreement and April 2017 Sales Agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds of any shares of BGC Class A common stock sold for general corporate purposes for potential acquisitions, redemptions of LPUs and FPUs in BGC Holdings and repurchases of shares of BGC Class A common stock from partners, executive officers and other employees of ours or our subsidiaries and of Cantor and its affiliates. Certain of such partners will be expected to use the proceeds from such sales to repay outstanding loans issued by, or credit enhanced by, Cantor, or BGC Holdings. In addition to general corporate purposes, these sales along with our share repurchase authorization are designed as a planning device in order to facilitate the redemption process. Going forward, we may redeem units and reduce our fully diluted share count under our repurchase authorization or later sell shares of BGC Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement.\nOn February 27, 2019, the Audit Committee authorized the purchase by Mr. Lutnick's retirement plan of up to $56,038 of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on March 4, 2019. Pursuant to this authorization, 8,980 shares of BGC Class A common stock were purchased by the plan on March 5, 2019 at $6.24 per share, the closing price on March 4, 2019.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the cancellation of 113,032 non-exchangeable PSUs held by Mr. Merkel, and the cancellation of 89,225 non-exchangeable PPSUs (which had a determination price of $5.36 per unit). In connection with these transactions, the Company issued $1,062,500 in BGC Class A common stock, less applicable taxes and withholdings at a 45% tax rate, resulting in 113,032 net shares of BGC Class A common stock at a price of $5.17 per share and the payment of $478,123 for taxes.\nOutside of U.S. Treasuries and spot FX, the banks and financial firms that dominate the OTC markets had, until recent years, generally been hesitant in adopting electronically traded products. However, the banks, broker-dealers, and other professional trading firms are now much more active in Hybrid and Fully Electronically traded markets across various OTC products, including credit derivative indices, FX derivatives, non-U.S. sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and interest rate derivatives. These electronic markets have grown as a percentage of overall industry volumes for the past few years as firms like BGC have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers. Regulation in Asia, Europe and the U.S. regarding banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives has accelerated the adoption of Fully Electronic execution, and we expect this to continue. We also believe that new clients, beyond our large bank customer base, will primarily transact electronically across our Fenics platform.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCommunications expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 1.1%, to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of total revenues, communications slightly decreased from the prior year period.\n\nTotal brokerage revenues increased by $172.3 million, or 10.4%, to $1,824.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Commission revenues increased by $177.1 million, or 13.3%, to $1,511.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Principal transactions revenues decreased by $4.8 million, or 1.5%, to $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table provides certain volume and transaction count information for the quarterly periods indicated:\nAdditionally, in August 2013, the Audit Committee authorized us to invest up to $350 million in an asset-backed commercial paper program for which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The notes are backed by assets of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy guidelines, including policies relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from the short-term note issuer and the rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no investments in the program.\nNasdaq Transaction\nOur revenues are derived primarily from brokerage commissions charged for either agency or matched principal transactions, fees from related parties, fees charged for market data, analytics and post-trade products, fees from software solutions, and interest income.\nExpenses\nFees to related parties increased by $4.3 million, or 27.5%, to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Fees to related parties are allocations paid to Cantor for administrative and support services (such as accounting, occupancy, and legal).\nAs of December 31, 2019, $561.9 million of net assets were held by regulated subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, these subsidiaries had aggregate regulatory net capital, as defined, in excess of the aggregate regulatory requirements, as defined, of $291.2 million.\nCredit\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. This discussion is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding continued membership in the EU. The exit from the EU is commonly referred to as Brexit. The Brexit vote passed by 51.9% to 48.1%. The U.K. subsequently formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, but its relationship with the bloc will remain in a transition period until December 31, 2020. During this period, the U.K. will, with some exceptions, remain subject to EU law. It will also maintain access to the EU's single market. If both the U.K. and the EU agree, this transition period may be extended once by up to two years, meaning it could remain in place until December 31, 2022. Such an extension must, however, be agreed upon before July 1, 2020. The U.K. government has ruled out any extension to the transition period and has legislated for a commitment not to agree to any extension. The government would then only be able to reverse that provision through new legislation.\nOther changes in working capital represent changes primarily in receivables and payables and accrued liabilities that impact our liquidity.\nImpact of ASC 606 on Results\n \u2022 increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support operations; \nOther expenses increased by $43.1 million, or 67.0%, to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to our previously disclosed settlements with the CFTC and the NYAG, as well as higher costs associated with the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ed Broking.\nWe had no gains or losses from divestitures or sale of investments in the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was a gain of $0.6 million related to the sale of investments.\nThe table below details our brokerage revenues by product category for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nOn November 7, 2017, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 1,179,788 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 823,178 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $2,828,629, Cantor purchased 823,178 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $2,828,629. In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, on November 7, 2017, Cantor purchased 356,610 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $1,091,175 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange for 356,610 founding partner units. As a result of the Newmark IPO and the related Separation and Distribution Agreement, the aggregate exchangeable limited partnership units represent 1,179,788 and 536,267 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, respectively.\nTotal brokerage revenues increased by $143.2 million, or 7.8%, to $1,967.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Commission revenues increased by $134.3 million, or 8.9%, to $1,645.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Principal transactions revenues increased by $8.9 million, or 2.8%, to $321.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe laws and regulations passed or proposed on both sides of the Atlantic concerning OTC trading seem likely to favor increased use of technology by all market participants, and are likely to accelerate the adoption of both Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution. We believe these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, non-public local competitors, as the smaller players generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in technology. We believe this will lead to further consolidation across the wholesale financial brokerage industry, and thus allow us to profitably grow our front-office headcount.\n\n Operating leases are related to rental payments under various non-cancelable leases, principally for office space, net of sublease payments to be received. The total amount of sublease payments to be received is approximately $0.1 million over the life of the agreement. \n Other contractual obligations reflect commitments to make charitable contributions, which are recorded as part of Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities\u201d in the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount payable each year reflects an estimate of future Charity Day obligations. \nMiFID II requires a significant part of the market in these instruments to trade on trading venues subject to transparency regimes, not only in pre- and post-trade prices, but also in fee structures and access. In addition, it has impacted a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection.\nOther Expenses\nOn February 5, 2020, the Board declared a 14 cent dividend for the fourth quarter. We anticipate having substantial resources with which to pay dividends, repurchase shares and/or units, profitably hire, and make accretive acquisitions, all with the goal of maintaining our investment grade rating.\nOn December 13, 2017, prior to the Newmark IPO, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities relating to our Real Estate Services business to Newmark. In connection with the Separation, Newmark assumed certain indebtedness and made a proportional distribution of interests in Newmark Holdings to holders of interests in BGC Holdings.\nData, software and post-trade\nGlobal equity volumes were generally down during 2019. Research from Raymond James indicates that the average daily volumes of U.S. cash equities and U.S. options were down 4% and 5%, respectively, from a year ago. Over the same timeframe, average daily volumes of European cash equities were down 18% (in notional value), while Eurex average daily volumes of equity derivatives were up 4%. Our overall revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased by 14.3% to $409.2 million, which was driven by the acquisition of Ed Broking.\nOn November 15, 2018, we acquired Poten & Partners, a leading ship brokerage, consulting and business intelligence firm specializing in LNG, tanker and LPG markets. Founded over 80 years ago and with 170 employees worldwide, Poten & Partners provides its clients with valuable insight into the international oil, gas and shipping markets.\nIn addition, the GDPR came into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018 and creates new compliance obligations in relation to personal data. The GDPR may affect our practices, and will increase financial penalties for non-compliance significantly.\nOverall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. Meanwhile, economists expect that the effects of various forms of quantitative easing undertaken by the various major central banks over the past several years will continue to negatively impact financial market volumes, as economic growth remains weak in most OECD countries. As a result, we expect long-term tailwinds in our rates business from continuing high levels of government debt, but continued near-term headwinds due to the current low interest rate environment and continued accommodative monetary policies globally.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nChanges in Reverse repurchase agreements, Securities owned, and Marketable securities may result from additional cash investments or sales, which will be offset by a corresponding change in Cash and cash equivalents and, accordingly, will not result in a change in our liquidity. Conversely, changes in the market value of such securities are reflected in our earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) and will result in changes in our liquidity.\n\nOn March 11, 2018, as part of 2017 year-end compensation, the BGC Compensation Committee authorized the Company to issue Mr. Lutnick $30.0 million of BGC Class A common stock, less applicable taxes and withholdings, based on a price of $14.33 per share, which was the closing price of BGC Class A common stock on the trading day prior to the date of issuance, which resulted in the net issuance of 979,344 shares of BGC Class A common stock. In exchange, the following equivalent units were redeemed and cancelled: an aggregate of 2,348,479 non-exchangeable LPUs of BGC Holdings consisting of 1,637,215 non-exchangeable BGC Holdings PSUs and 711,264 BGC Holdings PPSUs, having various determination prices per unit based on the date of the grant, and associated non-exchangeable LPUs of Newmark Holdings consisting of 774,566 of non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs and 336,499 of non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PPSUs.\nAdditional factors have weighed down market volumes in the products we broker. For example, the Basel III accord, implemented in late 2010 by the G-20 central banks, is a global regulatory framework on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk that was developed with the intention of making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis by increasing bank liquidity and reducing bank leverage. The accord, which is expected to be fully phased in as of January 1, 2022, has already required most large banks in G-20 nations to hold approximately three times as much Tier 1 capital as was required under the previous set of rules. These capital rules have made it more expensive for banks to hold non-sovereign debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say that banks have reduced their proprietary trading activity in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has further reduced overall market exposure and industry volumes in many of the products we broker, particularly in credit.\nWe generate interest income primarily from the investment of our daily cash balances, interest earned on securities owned and reverse repurchase agreements. These investments and transactions are generally short-term in nature. We also earn interest income from employee loans, and we earn dividend income on certain marketable securities.\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased by $6.7 million, or 4.7%, to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by increases in software, occupancy, and maintenance contracts.\nSince 2016, the Company has completed acquisitions whose purchase price included an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $9.2 million), 0.1 million LPUs (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $0.2 million), 0.2 million RSUs (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $1.2 million) and $34.3 million in cash that may be issued contingent on certain targets being met through 2022.\nOther Income (Losses), Net\nAs of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, which we define as Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements, was $473.2 million. We expect to use our financial resources to repay debt, profitably hire, make accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, and/or repurchase shares and units of BGC, all while maintaining or improving our investment-grade rating.\nSelling and Promotion\nFees from related parties increased by $5.4 million, or 22.3% to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments\nLimited Partnership Units: LPUs in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings are generally held by employees. Generally, such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain LPUs, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability or redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of common stock to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange or grant. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. Our Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such LPUs are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries decreased by $0.8 million, or 2.5%, to $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCommunications\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nOn February 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Besso, an independent Lloyd's of London insurance broker with a strong reputation across property, casualty, marine, aviation, professional and financial risks and reinsurance.\nFees from Related Parties\nOur credit revenues increased by $7.6 million, or 2.7%, to $292.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to higher global volumes and an uptick in Fully Electronic credit brokerage.\nRevenues\nSee Note 1- Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nThe Compensation Committee may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock such as RSUs, bonus stock, performance awards, dividend equivalents and other equity-based awards, including to provide exchange rights for shares of BGC Class A common stock upon exchange of LPUs. On June 22, 2016, at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved our Equity Plan to increase from 350 million to 400 million the aggregate number of shares of BGC Class A common stock that may be delivered or cash-settled pursuant to awards granted during the life of the Equity Plan. As of December 31, 2019, the limit on the aggregate number of shares authorized to be delivered allowed for the grant of future awards relating to 137.7 million shares of BGC Class A common stock.\nSee Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nData, Software and Post-Trade\nAcquisitions and financial reporting obligations related thereto may impact our ability to access longer-term capital markets funding on a timely basis and may necessitate greater short-term borrowings in the interim. This may impact our credit rating or the interest rates on our debt. We may need to access short-term capital sources to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not limited to, conducting operations; hiring or retaining brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel; financing acquisitions; and providing liquidity, including in situations where we may not be able to access the capital markets in a timely manner when desired by us. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.\n During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 0.2 million shares of BGC Class A common stock at an aggregate price of $1.2 million for a weighted-average price of $5.30 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock at an aggregate price of approximately $10.4 million for a weighted-average price of $13.23 per share. \nThe measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because our interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.\nGain (Loss) on Divestiture and Sale of Investments\nUnit Redemptions and Share Repurchase Program\nOn July 24, 2018, we issued an aggregate of $450.0 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023. The 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per year, payable in cash on January 24 and July 24 of each year, commencing January 24, 2019. The 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 will mature on July 24, 2023. We may redeem some or all of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 at any time or from time to time for cash at certain make-whole\u201d redemption prices (as set forth in the indenture related to the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023). If a Change of Control Triggering Event\u201d (as defined in the indenture related to the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. The initial carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 was $444.2 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $5.8 million, of which $0.3 million were underwriting fees paid to CF&Co and $41 thousand were underwriting fees paid to CastleOak Securities, L.P. We also paid CF&Co an advisory fee of $0.2 million in connection with the issuance. The issuance costs are amortized as interest expense and the carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $445.2 million.\nNet Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nRestricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the U.S. GAAP guidance. RSUs provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with the U.S. GAAP, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAs part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes. Interest on these notes was payable, semi-annually in arrears on the 19th of January and July. On July 19, 2018, the Company repaid the $240.0 million principal amount of its 8.375% Senior Notes upon their maturity.\nWe provide brokerage services for most widely traded energy and commodities products, including futures and OTC products covering, refined and crude oil, liquid natural gas, coal, electricity, gold and other precious metals, base metals, emissions, and soft commodities. We also provide brokerage services associated with the shipping of certain energy and commodities products.\nWe have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses for our businesses worldwide. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses for voice and data connections with our clients, clearing agents and general usage; professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects; and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings.\nEquities, Insurance, and Other Asset Classes\nNotes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company was authorized to enter into loans, investments or other credit support arrangements for Aqua; such arrangements are proportionally and on the same terms as similar arrangements between Aqua and Cantor. On February 5, 2020, the Company's Board and Audit Committee increased the authorized amount by an additional $2.0 million. The Company has been further authorized to provide counterparty or similar guarantees on behalf of Aqua from time to time, provided that liability for any such guarantees, as well as similar guarantees provided by Cantor, would be shared proportionally with Cantor (see Note 14- Related Party Transactions,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information).\nMuch of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S. based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we will continue to operate a number of EU regulated venues in accordance with EU directives and licensed by the FCA and other EU-based national Competent Authorities. These venues are also operated for non-derivative instruments for these clients. MiFID II was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority in September 2015, and implemented in January 2018 and introduced important infrastructural changes.\nInterest expense increased by $17.3 million, or 41.6%, to $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by interest expense on the $450.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 issued in July 2018, interest expense related to the borrowings on the Revolving Credit Agreement, and interest expense on the $300 million 3.750% Senior Notes issued in September 2019, partially offset by lower interest expense on the $240.0 million 8.375% Senior Notes which were repaid in July 2018.\nOn November 4, 2015, partners of BGC Holdings created five new classes of non-distributing partnership units (collectively with the NPSUs, N Units\u201d). These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional N\u201d to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of BGC Class A common stock. The Eleventh Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee and by the Board.\nFinancial Services Industry\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Capitalab completed its largest G-4 Interest Rates IMO to date with more than 15 participating counterparties. The service enabled these counterparties to multilaterally shrink delta, vega and curvature bilateral counterparty risks and significantly reduce both non-cleared and cleared initial margin at the Central Clearing Counterparty. In January of 2018, Capitalab executed the first combined compression cycle in Swaptions, Caps, Floors and cleared interest rate swaps due to its appointment as an Approved Compression Service Provider at LCH's SwapClear. In the second quarter of 2019, Capitalab launched its Nikkei 225 options compression service in partnership with the Singapore Exchange.\nAs a result of the sale of eSpeed, we only sold our on-the-run benchmark 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year Fully Electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds. We continue to offer Voice brokerage for on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, as well as across various other products in rates, credit, FX, market data and software solutions. As we continue to focus our efforts on converting Voice and Hybrid desks to Fully Electronic execution, our e-businesses and revenues from inter-company data, software, and post-trade services, have continued to grow their revenues.\nOur funding base consists of longer-term capital (equity and notes payable), collateralized financings, shorter-term liabilities and accruals that are a natural outgrowth of specific assets and/or our business model, such as matched fails and accrued compensation. We have limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our regulated entities for their brokerage businesses. Contingent liquidity needs are largely limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Capital expenditures tend to be cash neutral and approximately in line with depreciation. Current cash balances exceed our potential normal course contingent liquidity needs. We believe that cash in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks and cash segregated under regulatory requirements, is adequate for potential cash demands of normal operations, such as margin or fail financing. We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, including any dividends paid pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we continually evaluate opportunities for us to maximize our growth and further enhance our strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types and combinations of equity, debt and acquisition alternatives. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds to:\nThe fully diluted period-end spot share count was as follows (in thousands):\nOn September 8, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The revolving credit agreement provided for revolving loans of up to $400.0 million. The maturity date of the facility was September 8, 2019. On November 22, 2017, the Company and Newmark entered into an amendment to the unsecured senior revolving credit agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the then-outstanding borrowings of the Company under the revolving credit facility were converted into the Converted Term Loan. There was no change in the maturity date or interest rate. Effective December 13, 2017, Newmark assumed the obligations of the Company as borrower under the Converted Term Loan. We remained a borrower under, and retained access to, the revolving credit facility for any future draws, subject to availability which increased as Newmark repaid the Converted Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the outstanding balance of the Converted Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed $195.0 million under the committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement and repaid the $195.0 million during the year. Therefore, there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n Interest on long-term debt and collateralized borrowings also includes interest on the undrawn portion of the committed unsecured senior Revolving Credit Agreement which was calculated through the maturity date of the facility, which is February 26, 2021. As of December 31, 2019, the undrawn portion of the committed unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement was $280.0 million. \nOverall Market Volumes and Volatility\nCommunications expense increased by $2.0 million, or 1.7%, to $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of total revenues, communications expense slightly decreased from the prior year period.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nOn November 23, 2018, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, BGC issued 10,323,366 shares of BGC Class B common stock to Cantor and 712,907 shares of BGC Class B common stock to CFGM, an affiliate of Cantor, in each case in exchange for shares of BGC Class A common stock from Cantor and CFGM, respectively, on a one-to-one basis pursuant to Cantor's and CFGM's right to exchange such shares under the Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B Issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.\nOur brokerage revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased by $29.7 million, or 9.0%, to $358.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by improved global volumes, and revenues generated by Besso, which was acquired on February 28, 2017.\nThis uncertainty could adversely impact investor confidence which could result in additional market volatility. Historically, elevated volatility has often led to increased volumes in the Financial Services markets in which we broker, which could be beneficial for our businesses. At other times, increased volatility has led to many market participants curtailing trading activity. Furthermore, any future trade deal might lead to a fragmented regulatory environment, which could increase the costs of our operations and loss of existing levels of cross-border market access. While we have implemented plans to ensure continuity of service in Europe and continue to have regulated entities and offices in place in many of the major European markets in order to mitigate certain risks and uncertainties created by political negotiations between the U.K. and EU, these and other risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our customers, counterparties, businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nGoing forward, we expect these businesses to become an even more valuable part of BGC as they continue to grow.\nOn July 31, 2018, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which, upon being declared effective by the SEC, the holders of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023, issued in a private placement on July 24, 2018, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nCONTINGENT PAYMENTS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS\nOn December 14, 2016, partners of BGC Holdings amended certain terms and conditions of the partnership's N Units in order to provide flexibility to the Company and the Partnership in using such N Units in connection with compensation arrangements and practices. The amendment provides for a minimum $5 million gross revenue requirement in a given quarter as a condition for an N Unit to be replaced by another type of partnership unit in accordance with the Partnership Agreement and the grant documentation. The amendment was approved by the Audit Committee.\nCollateralized Borrowings", "item_7_text": "Given the current uncertainty around the future trade relationship and/or the length of the transition period, the consequences for the economies of the U.K. and the EU member states as a result of the U.K.'s withdrawal from the EU are unknown and unpredictable. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what the broader macro-economic and financial implications the U.K. leaving the EU with no agreements in place would have.\nOur investing and funding activities represent a combination of our capital raising activities, including short-term borrowings and repayments, issuances of shares under our CEO Program (net), BGC Class A common stock repurchases and partnership unit redemptions, purchases and sales of securities, dispositions, and other investments (e.g. acquisitions, forgivable loans to new brokers and capital expenditures-all net of depreciation and amortization).\nOther revenues increased by $6.0 million, or 62.6% to $15.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by revenues generated from the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ed Broking.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS\nOccupancy and Equipment\nEquities, Insurance, and Other Asset Classes\nIn addition, we also enter into deferred compensation agreements with employees providing services to us. The costs associated with such plans are generally amortized over the period in which they vest. See Note 19- Compensation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements.\nEnergy and Commodities\nOn December 9, 2014, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes. The 5.375% Senior Notes were general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. These Senior Notes bore interest at a rate of 5.375% per year, payable in cash on June 9 and December 9 of each year, commencing June 9, 2015. The interest rate payable on the notes was subject to adjustments from time to time based on the debt rating assigned by specified rating agencies to the notes, as set forth in the Indenture. The 5.375% Senior Notes were scheduled to mature on December 9, 2019. In connection with the issuance of the 5.375% Senior Notes, we lent the proceeds of the 5.375% Senior Notes to BGC U.S. OpCo, and BGC U.S. OpCo issued the 2019 Promissory Note. On December 13, 2017, Newmark OpCo assumed all of BGC U.S. OpCo's rights and obligations under the 2019 Promissory Note. The initial carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes was $295.1 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.9 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the Company in full for the 2019 Promissory Note, and the Company subsequently redeemed the 5.375% Senior Notes on December 5, 2018.\nOccupancy and Equipment\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company continues to believe that the allegations pled against the defendants in the amended complaint are without merit and intends to defend against them vigorously as the case moves forward. However, as in any litigated matter, the outcome cannot be determined with certainty.\nOther income (loss) decreased by $17.5 million, or 34.7% to $33.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This was primarily driven by a decrease related to fair value adjustments on investments carried under the measurement alternative. There was also a decrease related the mark-to-market and/or hedging on the Nasdaq earn out shares. This was partially offset by an increase in other recoveries related to our insurance business.\nDiscretionary Bonus: A portion of our compensation and employee benefits expense is comprised of discretionary bonuses, which may be paid in cash, equity, partnership awards or a combination thereof. We accrue expense in a period based on revenues in that period and on the expected combination of cash, equity and partnership units. Given the assumptions used in estimating discretionary bonuses, actual results may differ.\nRevenue Recognition\nFurther, we have an effective registration statement on Form S-4 filed on September 3, 2010, with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20 million shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued an aggregate of 13.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under this Form S-4 registration statement. Additionally, on September 13, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4, with respect to the offer and sale of up to 20 million shares of Class A common stock from time to time in connection with business combination transactions, including acquisitions of other businesses, assets, properties or securities. As of December 31, 2019, we have not issued any shares of BGC Class A common stock under this Form S-4 registration statement. We also have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which we can offer and sell up to 10 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under the BGC Partners, Inc. Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan. As of December 31, 2019, we have issued approximately 0.6 million shares of BGC Class A common stock under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan.\nEquity-Based and Other Compensation\nIn September 2019, two of the Company's subsidiaries, BGC Financial L.P. and GFI Group Inc., settled investigations conducted jointly by the CFTC and the NYAG. The CFTC and NYAG alleged that, in 2014 and 2015, certain emerging markets FX options (EFX options) brokers in the U.S. misrepresented that certain prices posted to their electronic platform were immediately executable when in fact they were not and that such brokers had communicated that transactions had been matched when they had not. On October 9, 2019, the Company paid an aggregate of $25.0 million in connection with the settlements and agreed to a monitor for two years to assess regulatory compliance. The NYAG settlements include a non-prosecution agreement, and there was no criminal penalty from either agency.\nRates\nWe have invested significantly to capitalize on the current business environment through acquisitions, technology spending and the hiring of new brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel. The business climate for these acquisitions has been competitive, and it is expected that these conditions will persist for the foreseeable future. We have been able to attract businesses and brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel to our platform as we believe they recognize that we have the scale, technology, experience and expertise to succeed in the current business environment.\nOur customers include many of the world's largest banks, broker-dealers, investment banks, trading firms, hedge funds, governments, corporations, and investment firms. We have dozens of offices globally in major markets including New York and London, as well as in Bahrain, Beijing, Bermuda, Bogot\u00e1, Brisbane, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Copenhagen, Dubai, Dublin, Frankfurt, Geneva, Hong Kong, Houston, Istanbul, Johannesburg, Madrid, Melbourne, Mexico City, Moscow, Nyon, Paris, Rio de Janeiro, Santiago, S\u00e3o Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Sydney, Tel Aviv, Tokyo and Toronto.\nSubject to the approval of the Compensation Committee or its designee, certain N Units may be converted into the underlying unit type (i.e. an NREU will be converted into an REU) and will then participate in partnership distributions, subject to terms and conditions determined by the general partner of BGC Holdings in its sole discretion, including that the recipient continue to provide substantial services to the Company and comply with his or her partnership obligations. Such N Units are not included in the fully diluted share count.\nIncome Taxes\nProfessional and Consulting Fees\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, industry volumes were generally mixed year-over-year across fixed income, and higher for commodities, while FX and equities industry volumes were generally lower. Below is an expanded discussion of the volume and growth drivers of our various brokerage product categories.\nOur FX revenues increased by $71.9 million, or 22.2%, to $396.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by improved global volumes and increased market volatility.\nOur position as a leading wholesale financial broker is enhanced by our Hybrid brokerage platform. We believe that the more complex, less liquid markets on which we focus often require significant amounts of personal and attentive service from our brokers. In more mature markets, we offer Fully Electronic execution capabilities to our customers through our platforms, including Fenics and BGC Trader. Our Hybrid platform allows our customers to trade on a Voice, Hybrid or, where available, Fully Electronic basis, regardless of whether the trade is OTC or exchange-based, and to benefit from the experience and market intelligence of our worldwide brokerage network. Our electronic capabilities include clearing, settlement, post-trade, and other back-office services as well as straight-through processing for our customers across several products. Furthermore, we benefit from the operational leverage in our Fully Electronic platform. We believe our Hybrid brokerage approach provides a competitive advantage over competitors who do not offer this full range of technology.\n \u2022 support continued growth in our businesses; \nGain (Loss) on Divestiture and Sale of Investments\nThe financial services industry has grown historically due to several factors. One factor was the increasing use of derivatives to manage risk or to take advantage of the anticipated direction of a market by allowing users to protect gains and/or guard against losses in the price of underlying assets without having to buy or sell the underlying assets. Derivatives are often used to mitigate the risks associated with interest rates, equity ownership, changes in the value of FX, credit defaults by corporate and sovereign debtors and changes in the prices of commodity products. Over this same timeframe, demand from financial institutions, financial services intermediaries and large corporations have increased volumes in the wholesale derivatives market, thereby increasing the business opportunity for financial intermediaries.\nWe currently have in place an effective equity shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed on March 9, 2018 with respect to the issuance and sale of up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of shares of BGC Class A common stock from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis. On March 9, 2018, we entered into the March 2018 Sales Agreement, pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to an aggregate of $300.0 million of shares of BGC Class A common stock. Proceeds from shares of BGC Class A common stock sold under this CEO Program Sales Agreement may be used for redemptions of limited partnership interests in BGC Holdings, as well as for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions and the repayment of debt. CF&Co is a wholly owned subsidiary of Cantor and an affiliate of us. Under this Sales Agreement, we have agreed to pay CF&Co 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of shares. For additional information on the Company's CEO Program sales agreements, see Note 14- Related Party Transactions.\u201d\nThe $62.3 million increase in our liquidity position from $410.9 million as of December 31, 2018 to $473.2 million as of December 31, 2019 was primarily related to the issuance of $300.0 million of the 3.750% Senior Notes, increased collateralized and other net borrowings of $82.6 million, partially offset by the financing of acquisitions, ordinary movements in working capital, and our continued investment in new revenue generating hires.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Windeatt with respect to 139,265 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $5.17 per share on such date, had a value of $720,000) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $4.388 per unit) of 63,814 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $280,002 for taxes. On February 22, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Windeatt with respect to an additional 22,020 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $6.26 per share on such date, had a value of $137,845) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $5.6457 per unit) of 9,495 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $53,606 for taxes.\nGlobal FX volumes were generally lower during 2019. Spot FX volumes at CME, Refinitiv (formerly the Financial & Risk business of Thomson Reuters), and EBS (CME formerly NEX) were down 14%, flat, and down 17%, respectively. In comparison, our overall FX revenues decreased by 6.5% to $370.3 million.\n Included in redemption/exchanges of limited partnership interests for the year ended December 31, 2019, are 10.1 million shares of BGC Class A common stock granted in connection with the cancellation of 11.5 million LPUs. Included in redemption/exchanges of limited partnership interests for the year ended December 31, 2018, are 6.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock granted in connection with the cancellation of 7.6 million LPUs. Because LPUs are included in the Company's fully diluted share count, if dilutive, redemption/exchange in connection with the issuance of Class A common shares would not impact the fully diluted number of shares and units outstanding. \nWe expect to benefit from the secular trend towards electronic trading, increased demand for market data, and the need for increased automation and post-trade services. We continue to onboard new customers as the opportunities created by electronic and algorithmic trading continue to transform our industry. We continue to roll out our next-gen Fenics brokerage platforms across more products and geographies with the goal of seamlessly integrating Voice liquidity with customer electronic orders either by a graphical user interface or application programming interface, and we expect to have continued success converting Voice/Hybrid desks over time as we roll out these platforms across more products and geographies.\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $51.1 million, or 5.4%, to $1,001.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The main drivers of this increase were the impact of higher brokerage revenues on variable compensation, and the acquisition of Poten & Partners in November 2018.\nOur brokerage revenues from energy and commodities increased by $24.2 million, or 11.9%, to $228.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by improved global volumes.\nOther income (loss) increased by $24.6 million, or 95.1%, to $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase was primarily due to a gain of $37.6 million related to a fair value adjustment on an investment held. This was partially offset by a decrease related to the mark-to-market and/or hedging on the Nasdaq shares and a decrease in other recoveries.\nCLEARING CAPITAL\n\nGains (Losses) on Divestitures and Sale of Investments\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes decreased by $22.9 million, or 30.1%, to $53.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by lower pre-tax earnings, as well as a change in the geographical and business mix of earnings, which can have an impact on our consolidated effective tax rate from period-to-period.\n \u2022 a right of the employer of a partner (whether it be Newmark or BGC) to determine whether to grant exchangeability with respect to Legacy BGC Holdings Units or Legacy Newmark Holdings Units held by such partner. \nIn April 2013, the Board and Audit Committee authorized management to enter into indemnification agreements with Cantor and its affiliates with respect to the provision of any guarantees provided by Cantor and its affiliates from time to time as required by regulators. These services may be provided from time to time at a reasonable and customary fee.\nData, Software and Post-Trade\nThrough brands including BGC\u00ae, GFI\u00ae, Sunrise\u2122, Besso\u2122, Ed Broking\u00ae, Poten & Partners\u2122 and RP Martin\u2122, among others, our businesses specialize in the brokerage of a broad range of products, including fixed income such as government bonds, corporate bonds, and other debt instruments, as well as related interest rate derivatives and credit derivatives. We also broker products across FX, equities, energy and commodities, insurance, and futures. Our businesses also provide a wide variety of services, including trade execution, brokerage services, clearing, trade compression, post-trade, information, and other back-office services to a broad assortment of financial and non-financial institutions. Our integrated platform is designed to provide flexibility to customers with regard to price discovery, execution and processing of transactions, and enables them to use Voice, Hybrid, or in many markets, Fully Electronic brokerage services in connection with transactions executed either OTC or through an exchange. Through our Fenics\u00ae group of electronic brands, we offer a number of market infrastructure and connectivity services, Fully Electronic marketplaces, and the Fully Electronic brokerage of certain products that also may trade via Voice and Hybrid execution. The full suite of Fenics\u00ae offerings include market data and related information services, Fully Electronic brokerage, compression and other post-trade services, analytics related to financial instruments and markets, and other financial technology solutions. Fenics\u00ae brands operate under the names Fenics\u00ae, BGC Trader\u2122, CreditMatch\u00ae, Fenics MD\u2122, BGC Market Data\u2122, kACE2\u00ae, EMBonds\u00ae, Capitalab\u00ae, Swaptioniser\u00ae, CBID\u00ae and Lucera\u00ae.\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nAs of December 31, 2019, 1.9 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock and 0.2 million RSUs remain to be issued, and $24.1 million in cash remains to be paid, net of forfeitures and other adjustments, if the targets are met.\nData, software and post-trade revenues increased by $8.0 million, or 12.2%, to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Poten & Partners, an increase in revenues from post-trade services and new business contracts.\nNet Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nWe consider our liquidity to be comprised of the sum of Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities, and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements. The discussion below describes the key components of our liquidity analysis, including earnings, dividends and distributions, net investing and funding activities, including repurchases and redemptions of BGC Class A common stock and partnership units, security settlements, changes in securities held and marketable securities, and changes in our working capital.\nNewmark IPO, Separation and Spin-Off\nGains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro-rata share of the net gains (losses) on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control.\nWe provide for uncertain tax positions based upon management's assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Because significant assumptions are used in determining whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Provision for income taxes\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOn October 11, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of the 3.750% Senior Notes which were issued in a private placement, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nEQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased by $35.2 million, or 23.5%, to $184.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by increases related to the acquisitions of Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, and Ginga Petroleum, as well as rent expense related to the build-out phase of BGC's new U.K.-based headquarters.\n Financial results have been retrospectively adjusted as a result of the Spin-Off to reflect Newmark through November 30, 2018 as discontinued operations for all periods presented. \nKey drivers of our revenue are front-office producer headcount and average revenue per producer. We believe that our strong technology platform and unique partnership structure have enabled us to use both acquisitions and recruiting to profitably increase our front-office staff at a faster rate than our largest competitors since our formation in 2004.\nGains (losses) on equity method investments increased by $2.8 million, or 59.4%, to a gain of $7.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a gain of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Gains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro-rata share of the net gains or losses on investments over which we have significant influence but which we do not control.\n\nIn connection with the Company's 2018 executive compensation process, the Company's executive officers received certain monetization of prior awards as set forth below.\nThe weighted-average share counts from continuing operations, including securities that were anti-dilutive for our earnings per share calculations, for the three months and year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\nBrexit\nIn December 2017, Newmark completed its IPO of an aggregate of 23 million shares of Newmark Class A common stock. Prior to the Newmark IPO, Newmark was our wholly owned subsidiary.\n \u2022 effect acquisitions, strategic alliances, joint ventures and other transactions; \nAs of December 31, 2019, our front-office headcount, including our insurance brokerage business, was 2,990 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, up 13% from 2,654 a year ago. Our total technology headcount increased by 8% year-on-year to 691, related primarily to our newer Fenics stand-alone Fully Electronic offerings. Compared to the prior year, average revenue per front-office employee, including our insurance brokerage business, for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 7% to $703 thousand from $756 thousand. All figures mentioned in the previous two paragraphs exclude Newmark.\nPossible Restructuring\nInterest income decreased by $0.2 million, or 1.1%, to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES and estimates\nCompensation and employee benefits expense increased by $126.3 million, or 12.6%, to $1,127.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The main drivers of this increase were the acquisitions of Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, and Ginga Petroleum, as well as the impact of higher brokerage revenues on variable compensation.\nThe table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017:\nThe combination of more market acceptance of Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution and our competitive advantage in terms of technology and experience has contributed to our strong gains in electronically traded products. We continue to invest in Hybrid and Fully Electronic technology broadly across our product categories, not only launching existing product pools but also launching new platforms with market leading protocols and functionality, which we believe will be game changing in the sector. Fenics has exhibited strong growth over the past several years, and we believe that this growth has outpaced the wholesale brokerage industry as a whole. We expect this trend to accelerate as we convert more of our Voice and Hybrid brokerage into Fully Electronic brokerage across our Fenics platform.\nThe increase in brokerage revenues was primarily driven by increases in revenues from rates, FX, equities, insurance, and other asset classes, and energy and commodities.\n \u2022 develop new or enhanced products, services and markets; and \nOur brokerage revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased by $51.1 million, or 14.3%, to $409.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was driven by the acquisition of Ed Broking.\nBrokerage Revenues\nCertain LPUs are granted exchangeability into shares of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock or are redeemed in connection with the grant of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock issued; BGC Class A common stock is issued on a one-for-one basis, and Newmark Class A common stock is issued based on the number of LPUs exchanged or redeemed multiplied by the then Exchange Ratio. At the time exchangeability is granted or shares of BGC or Newmark Class A common stock are issued, we recognize an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred compensation expense of $100.9 million, $150.1 million and $176.5 million, respectively.\n</table>\nOn December 16, 2019, we filed a registration statement on Form S-3 pursuant to which CF&Co may make offers and sales of our 5.125% Senior Notes, 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 and 3.750% Senior Notes in connection with ongoing market-making transactions which may occur from time to time. Such market-making transactions in these securities may occur in the open market or may be privately negotiated at prevailing market prices at a time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. Neither CF&Co, nor any other of our affiliates, has any obligation to make a market in our securities, and CF&Co or any such other affiliate may discontinue market-making activities at any time without notice.\nInterest Expense\nIn addition, self-regulatory organizations, such as the FINRA and the NFA, along with statutory bodies such as the FCA, the SEC, and the CFTC require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers and other third parties who deal with broker-dealers and are not designed to specifically protect stockholders. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements.\nGFI Merger\nFully Electronic (Fenics) and Hybrid Execution\nThe initial carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes was $295.8 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $4.2 million. The carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $298.7 million.\nOther Income (Losses), Net\nOn March 13, 2015, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $28.2 million under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurred interest at a fixed rate of 3.70% per year and matured on March 13, 2019; therefore, there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.8 million outstanding related to this secured loan agreement. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2018 was $0.1 million.\nOther Income (Loss)\nOther Expenses\n Partnership units collectively include FPUs, LPUs, and Cantor units (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information). \nCommissions and Floor Brokerage\n Given the net loss during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, approximately 180.8 million potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. For the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 0.9 million potentially dilutive securities were not included in the computation of fully diluted earnings per share because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Anti-dilutive securities for the year ended December 31, 2019 included, on a weighted-average basis, approximately 0.9 million RSUs. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 15.8 million shares of contingent Class A common stock and LPUs were excluded from fully diluted EPS computations because the conditions for issuance had not been met by the end of the period. The contingent Class A common stock is recorded as a liability and included in Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities\u201d in our consolidated statement of financial condition as of December 31, 2019. \n The components of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs are as follows (in thousands): \nThrough our software solutions business, we provide customized software to broaden distribution capabilities and provide electronic solutions to financial market participants. The software solutions business leverages our global infrastructure, software, systems, portfolio of intellectual property, and electronic trading expertise to provide customers with electronic marketplaces and exchanges and real-time auctions to enhance debt issuance and to customize trading interfaces. We take advantage of the scalability, flexibility and functionality of our electronic trading system to enable our customers to distribute products to their customers through online offerings and auctions, including private and reverse auctions, via our trading platform and global network. Using screen-based market solutions, customers are able to develop a marketplace, trade with their customers, issue debt, trade odd lots, access program trading interfaces and access our network and intellectual property. We provide option pricing and analysis tools that deliver price discovery that is supported with market data sourced from both our BGC and GFI trading systems.\nOur credit revenues increased by $14.5 million, or 5.0%, to $306.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was mainly due to higher global volumes.\nGoodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination. As prescribed in the U.S. GAAP guidance, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, goodwill is not amortized, but instead is periodically tested for impairment. We review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or whenever an event occurs or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nThe table below represents the units redeemed and/or shares repurchased for cash and does not include units redeemed/cancelled in connection with the grant of shares of BGC Class A common stock nor the limited partnership interests exchanged for shares of BGC Class A common stock. The gross unit redemptions and share repurchases of BGC Class A common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows (in thousands, except weighted-average price data):\nCertain of these LPUs entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount, generally in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These LPUs are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under the U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, we recognize a liability for these units on our consolidated statements of financial condition as part of Accrued compensation\u201d for the amortized portion of the post-termination payment amount, based on the current fair value of the expected future cash payout. We amortize the post-termination payment amount, less an expected forfeiture rate, over the vesting period, and record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period in our consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d\nBalance Sheet\nInterest Expense\nOn October 5, 2018, Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund filed a putative derivative complaint in the Delaware Chancery Court, captioned Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund vs. Howard Lutnick, et al. (Case No. 2018-0722), alleging breaches of fiduciary duty against (i) the members of the Board, (ii) Howard Lutnick, CFGM, and Cantor as controlling stockholders of BGC, and (iii) Howard Lutnick as an officer of BGC. The complaint challenges the transactions by which BGC (i) completed the Berkeley Point acquisition from CCRE for $875 million and (ii) committed to invest $100 million for a 27% interest in Real Estate, L.P. (collectively, the Transaction\u201d). Among other things, the complaint alleges that (i) the price BGC paid in connection with the Transaction was unfair, (ii) the process leading up to the Transaction was unfair, and (iii) the members of the special committee of the Board were not independent. It seeks to recover for the Company unquantified damages, disgorgement of any payments received by defendants, and attorneys' fees.\nOn October 3, 2018, Mr. Lutnick donated an aggregate of 53,368 shares of BGC Class A common stock from his personal asset trust to a charitable foundation for which his spouse serves as a director. The Company repurchased the 53,368 shares from the charitable foundation at a price of $11.73 per share, which was the closing price of BGC Class A common stock on that date. The transaction was approved by the Audit Committee.\n\n\nThe second step of the process involves the calculation of an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which step one indicated a potential impairment may exist. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in step one, over the estimated fair values of the individual assets, liabilities and identified intangibles. Events such as economic weakness, significant declines in operating results of reporting units, or significant changes to critical inputs of the goodwill impairment test (e.g., estimates of cash flows or cost of capital) could cause the estimated fair value of our reporting units to decline, which could result in an impairment of goodwill in the future.\nOur FX revenues decreased by $25.9 million, or 6.5%, to $370.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by lower global volumes and a decrease in market volatility.\nProvision (benefit) for income taxes decreased by $16.7 million, or 17.9%, to $76.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by the effect of the Tax Act in 2017 related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the one-time transition tax on accumulated foreign earnings partially offset by GILTI. In general, our consolidated effective tax rate can vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of our earnings.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d herein for information related to our liquidity and capital resources.\nOther Revenues\nThe final phase of Basel III (unofficially called Basel IV\u201d) is a global prudential regulatory standard designed to make banks more resilient and increase confidence in the banking system. Its wide scope includes reviewing market, credit and operational risk along with targeted changes to leverage ratios. Basel IV includes updates to the calculation of bank capital requirements with the aim of making outcomes more comparable across banks globally. Most of the requirements are expected to be implemented by national and regional authorities by around 2022. The adoption of these proposed rules could restrict the ability of our large bank and broker-dealer customers to operate trading businesses and to maintain current capital market exposures under the present structure of their balance sheets, and will cause these entities to need to raise additional capital in order to stay active in our marketplaces.\nProfessional and Consulting Fees\nFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS\nITEM 7.\nThe first step involves comparing each reporting unit's estimated fair value to its carrying value, including goodwill. To estimate the fair value of the reporting units, we use a discounted cash flow model and data regarding market comparables. The valuation process requires significant judgment and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These assumptions include cash flow projections, estimated cost of capital and the selection of peer companies and relevant multiples. Because assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future cash flows, choosing peer companies and selecting relevant multiples, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of potential impairment.\nOur securities settlement activities primarily represent deposits with clearing organizations. In addition, when advantageous, we may elect to facilitate the settlement of matched principal transactions by funding failed trades, which results in a temporary secured use of cash and is economically beneficial to us.\nThe $141.3 million decrease in our liquidity position from $552.1 million as of December 31, 2017 to $410.9 million as of December 31, 2018 was primarily related to our purchase of exchangeable limited partnership units in Newmark Holdings in the Investment in Newmark, cash paid with respect to various acquisitions throughout the year, our continued investment in revenue generating hires, and ordinary movements in working capital.\nOn January 31, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Micromega Securities, which operates in the South African fixed income, rates and FX markets.\nFX Volumes and Volatility\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs decreased by $39.5 million, or 19.2%, to $165.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in charges related to equity-based compensation, as well as a decrease in allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\nWe derive our revenues primarily through commissions from brokerage services, the spread between the buy and sell prices on matched principal transactions, fees from related parties, data, software and post-trade services, and other revenues. See Note 3- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding revenue recognition.\nThe following discussion of BGC Partners' financial condition and results of operations should be read together with BGC Partners' consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements, as well as the cautionary statements relating to forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Exchange Act, included in this report.\nOther Operating Expenses\nAs the above table indicates, our brokerage operations in the rates product category produce a significant percentage of our total brokerage revenues. We expect that revenues from our rates product brokerage operations will increase in absolute terms, but decline as a percentage of our overall revenues as we continue to invest in expanding in other asset classes.\nEmployee Loans: We have entered into various agreements with certain employees and partners, whereby these individuals receive loans that may be either wholly or in part repaid from distributions that the individuals receive on some or all of their limited partnership interests or may be forgiven over a period of time. Cash advance distribution loans are documented in formal agreements and are repayable in timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements. We intend for these advances to be repaid in full from the future distributions on existing and future awards granted. The distributions are treated as compensation expense when made and the proceeds are used to repay the loan. The forgivable portion of any loans is recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations over the life of the loan. We review the loan balances each reporting period for collectability. If we determine that the collectability of a portion of the loan balances is not expected, we recognize a reserve against the loan balances. Actual collectability of loan balances may differ from our estimates.\n The Company completed the calculation of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' earnings pursuant to the Tax Act and previously recorded a net cumulative tax expense of $25.0 million, net of foreign tax credits, with an election to pay the taxes over eight years with 40% to be paid in equal installments over the first five years and the remaining 60% to be paid in installments of 15%, 20% and 25% in years six, seven and eight, respectively. The cumulative remaining balance as of December 31, 2019 is $19.4 million. \nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had $415.4 million of Cash and cash equivalents, and included in this amount was $286.7 million of Cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries.\nOther revenues increased by $7.1 million, to $9.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisition of Poten & Partners in November 2018, as well as a settlement of $2.5 million received and recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nBefore our first quarter 2020 earnings call, we expect to submit a proposal to the Board and relevant committees with respect to converting our partnership into a corporation. Our current target is to be positioned to begin executing a conversion around the end of the third quarter of 2020, and expect to complete the execution around year end 2020. Any such restructuring would be subject to tax, accounting, regulatory, and other considerations and approvals.\nWe consider the following in analyzing changes in our liquidity.\nOn December 13, 2017, the Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement was amended and restated a second time to include prior standalone amendments and to make certain other changes related to the Separation. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement, among other things, reflects changes resulting from the division in the Separation of BGC Holdings into BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, including:\nSince mid-2016, the overall financial services industry has benefited from sustained economic growth, a lower unemployment rate, higher consumer spending, the modification or repeal of certain U.S. regulations, and higher investment income. In addition, the secular trend towards digitalization and electronification within the industry has contributed to higher overall volumes and transaction count in Fully Electronic execution. Looking ahead, concerns about the future trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU after Brexit, a slowdown in global growth driven by the outbreak of coronavirus in China, and an increase in trade protectionism are tempered by expectations of monetary and fiscal stimulus.\nIn addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain LPUs, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability or redemption in connection with the grant of shares of common stock to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange or redemption. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. Each quarter, the net profits of BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings are allocated to Preferred Units at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The Preferred Distribution is deducted before the calculation and distribution of the quarterly partnership distribution for the remaining partnership interests. The Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to the Preferred Distribution. Preferred Units may not be made exchangeable into our Class A common stock and are only entitled to the Preferred Distribution, and accordingly they are not included in our fully diluted share count. The quarterly allocations of net income on Preferred Units are reflected in compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe following table sets forth our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the indicated periods (in thousands). Results of any period are not necessarily indicative of results for a full year and may, in certain periods, be affected by seasonal fluctuations in our business. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior period amounts to conform to the current period's presentation.\n As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, $15.1 million and $144.7 million, respectively, of Marketable securities on our balance sheet had been lent in a Securities loaned transaction and therefore are not included in this Liquidity Analysis. \nAs we continue to focus our efforts on converting Voice and Hybrid desks to Fully Electronic execution, net revenues in our higher margin Fully Electronic businesses across brokerage, data, software, and post-trade increased 12.2% to $73.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Going forward, we expect Fenics to become an even more valuable part of BGC as it continues to grow. We continue to analyze how to optimally configure our Voice/Hybrid and Fully Electronic businesses.\nGoodwill\nIn February 2019, the Audit Committee authorized us to enter into a short-term services agreement with Cantor pursuant to which Cantor would be responsible for clearing, settling and processing certain transactions executed on behalf of customers in exchange for a 33% revenue share based on net transaction revenue and the payment by BGC of the fully allocated cost of certain salespersons related thereto.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur overall insurance brokerage business now includes Ed Broking, as well as our newly acquired aviation and space insurance brokerage business, whose producers are not yet generating meaningful revenue. Therefore, these newer insurance businesses are not yet up to scale. The pre-tax loss relating to our insurance brokerage business was $9.7 million and $18.0 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. The corresponding prior year periods had a pre-tax loss of $2.8 million and pre-tax income of $5.3 million for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2018, respectively.\nOn July 31, 2018, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the holders of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 which were issued in a private placement, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nBrokerage\nAt December 31, 2019, the Company completed the calculation of the one-time transition tax on the deemed repatriation of foreign subsidiaries' earnings pursuant to the Tax Act and previously recorded a net cumulative tax expense of $25.0 million, net of foreign tax credits. An installment election can be made to pay the taxes over eight years with 40% paid in equal installments over the first five years and the remaining 60% to be paid in installments of 15%, 20% and 25% in years six, seven and eight, respectively. The cumulative remaining balance as of December 31, 2019 is $19.4 million.\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017\nWe currently expect our overall insurance brokerage business to operate around breakeven for the next two years as we seek to double this division's current revenues. We also expect our overall investment to turn profitable and deliver margins in excess of 15% by 2022. This is similar to the trend in revenues and profitability of our former real estate services business, Newmark, over its first three years as part of BGC. We believe our insurance brokerage business is worth materially more than our investment and are actively considering ways to better express its value for the benefit of our investors.\nFor the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019, insurance brokerage revenues increased by 185.6% and 126.0% to $43.3 million and $155.8 million, respectively. Including interest income, total revenues associated with insurance brokerage increased by 186.5% and 127.7% to $44.0 million and $158.0 million, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2019.\nOn August 22, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured loan agreement with Itau Unibanco S.A. The credit agreement provides for short-term loans of up to $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million). The maturity date of the agreement is May 20, 2020. Borrowings under this facility bear interest at the Brazilian Interbank offering rate plus 3.30%. As of December 31, 2019, there were $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million) of borrowings outstanding under the facility. As of December 31, 2019, the interest rate was 7.8%.\nOur rates revenues, like the revenues for most of our products, are not fully dependent on market volumes and, therefore, do not always fluctuate consistently with industry metrics. This is largely because our Voice, Hybrid, and Fully Electronic desks in rates often have volume discounts built into their price structure, which results in our rates revenues being less volatile than the overall industry volumes.\nOn May 31, 2017, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $29.9 million under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.44% and matures on May 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $11.7 million and $19.2 million, respectively, outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2019 was $2.3 million. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2018 was $6.5 million.\nThe FX market is one of the largest financial markets in the world. FX transactions can either be undertaken in the spot market, in which one currency is sold and another is bought, or in the derivative market in which future settlement of the identical underlying currencies are traded. We provide full execution OTC brokerage services in most major currencies, including all G8 currencies, emerging market, cross and exotic options currencies.\nCertain of these LPUs entitle the holders to receive post-termination payments equal to the notional amount in four equal yearly installments after the holder's termination. These limited partnership units are accounted for as post-termination liability awards under U.S. GAAP guidance, which requires that we record an expense for such awards based on the change in value at each reporting period and include the expense in our consolidated statements of operations as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs.\u201d The liability for LPUs with a post-termination payout amount is included in Accrued compensation\u201d on our consolidated statements of financial condition.\nOn March 12, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Ginga Petroleum. Ginga Petroleum provides a comprehensive range of broking services for physical and derivative energy products, including naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas, fuel oil, biofuels, middle distillates, petrochemicals and gasoline.\nOn June 6, 2017, at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders of the Company, the Company's stockholders approved the Company's Incentive Plan to approve the material terms of the performance goals under the Incentive Plan for compliance with Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, including an amendment to those performance goals in order to broaden the stock price performance goal to include dividends and/or total stockholder return.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nOn June 28, 2013, we completed the sale of certain assets to Nasdaq, which purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from us and our affiliates, including the eSpeed brand name and various assets comprising the Fully Electronic portion of our benchmark on-the-run U.S. Treasury brokerage, market data and co-location service businesses, for cash consideration of $750 million paid at closing, plus an earn-out of up to 14,883,705 shares of Nasdaq common stock to be paid ratably in each of the fifteen years following the closing in which the consolidated gross revenue of Nasdaq is equal to or greater than $25 million. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company transferred the right to receive earn-out payments from Nasdaq to Newmark. Following the Spin-Off, the right to receive earn-out payments from Nasdaq remains with Newmark.\nMARKET SUMMARY\nAs part of our compensation plans, certain employees are granted LPUs in BGC Holdings which generally receive quarterly allocations of net income, that are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. As prescribed in U.S. GAAP guidance, the quarterly allocations of net income on such LPUs are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nAnother key factor in the historical growth of the financial services industry has been the increase in the number of new financial products. As market participants and their customers strive to mitigate risk, new types of equity and fixed income securities, futures, options and other financial instruments have been developed. Most of these new securities and derivatives were not immediately ready for more liquid and standardized electronic markets, and generally increased the need for trading and required broker-assisted execution.\nGains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments\nSee Regulation\u201d in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nOn February 16, 2018, the Audit Committee authorized the purchase by Mr. Lutnick's retirement plan of up to $105,000 of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on the date of purchase. Pursuant to this authorization, 7,883 shares of BGC Class A common stock were purchased by the plan on February 26, 2018 at $13.17 per share, the closing price on the date of purchase.\nOn March 19, 2018, we entered into the BGC Credit Agreement with Cantor. The BGC Credit Agreement provides for each party and certain of its subsidiaries to issue loans to the other party or any of its subsidiaries in the lender's discretion in an aggregate principal amount up to $250.0 million outstanding at any time. The BGC Credit Agreement replaced the previous Credit Facility between BGC and an affiliate of Cantor, and was approved by the Audit Committee. On August 6, 2018, the Company entered into an amendment to the BGC Credit Agreement, which increased the aggregate principal amount that can be loaned to the other party or any of its subsidiaries from $250.0 million to $400.0 million that can be outstanding at any time. The BGC Credit Agreement will mature on the earlier to occur of (a) March 19, 2020, after which the maturity date of the BGC Credit Agreement will continue to be extended for successive one-year periods unless prior written notice of non-extension is given by a lending party to a borrowing party at least six months in advance of such renewal date and (b) the termination of the BGC Credit Agreement by either party pursuant to its terms. The outstanding amounts under the BGC Credit Agreement will bear interest for any rate period at a per annum rate equal to the higher of BGC's or Cantor's short-term borrowing rate in effect at such time plus 1.00%. As of December 31, 2019, there were no borrowings by BGC or Cantor outstanding under this Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had over 2,900 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel across our businesses.\nSelling and promotion expense increased by $6.9 million, or 11.0%, to $69.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of total revenues, selling and promotion remained relatively unchanged across the two periods.\nBrokerage revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by $143.2 million. Our brokerage revenue growth was led by a 25.6% improvement in our energy and commodities business, which was driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, partially offset by the sale of CSC Commodities. Revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased 14.3% primarily due to the acquisition of Ed Broking. Our insurance brokerage revenues increased 126% for the full year 2019, largely due to the acquisition of Ed Broking. Because of the significant growth of this business, we expect to break out insurance brokerage revenues separately from equities and other asset classes in the next quarter. We believe our insurance brokerage business is worth materially more than our investment and are actively considering ways to better express its value for the benefit of our investors. Within our Fenics business, net revenues were up 6.4%. Our Fully Electronic brokerage revenues increased 4.4%, which was primarily led by a 13.7% increase in our Fenics rates business, while our revenues from our high margin data, software, and post-trade business increased 12.2%. As our stand-alone Fenics offerings continue to gain traction, we convert Voice and Hybrid revenue to higher margin Fully Electronic execution, and as our recently added brokers and salespeople ramp up production, we expect the Company's revenues and profits to grow.\nA month later, on November 5, 2018, the same plaintiffs' firm filed an identical putative derivative complaint against the same defendants seeking the same relief on behalf of a second client, Northern California Pipe Trades Trust Funds. The cases have been consolidated into a single action, captioned In re BGC Partners, Inc. Derivative Litigation (Consolidated C.A. No. 2018-0722-AGB), and the complaint filed by Roofers Local 149 Pension Fund on October 5, 2018 was designated as the operative complaint.\nGUARANTEE AGREEMENT FROM CF&CO\nFees to Related Parties\nOther Income (loss) is primarily comprised of gains or losses related to fair value adjustments on investments carried under the alternative method. Other Income (loss) also includes realized and unrealized gains or losses related to sales and mark-to-market adjustments on Marketable securities and any related hedging transactions when applicable. Acquisition-related fair value adjustments of contingent consideration and miscellaneous recoveries are also included in Other Income (loss).\n\nWe earn fees from related parties for technology services and software licenses and for certain administrative and back-office services we provide to affiliates, particularly from Cantor. These administrative and back-office services include office space, utilization of fixed assets, accounting services, operational support, human resources, legal services and information technology.\nSelling and promotion expense increased by $12.3 million, or 17.7%, to $81.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, and Ginga Petroleum.\nOn May 27, 2016, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 5.125% Senior Notes. The 5.125% Senior Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.125% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 5.125% per year, payable in cash on May 27 and November 27 of each year, commencing November 27, 2016. The 5.125% Senior Notes will mature on May 27, 2021. The Company may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time for cash at certain make-whole\u201d redemption prices (as set forth in the Indenture). If a Change of Control Triggering Event\u201d (as defined in the Indenture) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of its notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. Cantor purchased $15.0 million of such senior notes and still holds such notes as of December 31, 2019.\nGain (Loss) on divestiture and sale of investments represent the gain or loss we recognize for the divestiture or sale of our investments.\nRates volumes in particular are influenced by market volumes and, in certain instances, volatility. Historically low and negative interest rates across the globe have significantly reduced the overall trading appetite for rates products. As a result of central bank policies and actions, as well as continued expectations of low inflation rates, many sovereign bonds continue to trade at or close to negative yields, especially in real terms. In addition, also weighing on yields and rates volumes are global central bank quantitative easing programs. The programs depress rates volumes because they entail central banks buying government securities or other securities in the open market - particularly longer-dated instruments - in an effort to promote increased lending and liquidity and bring down long-term interest rates. When central banks hold these instruments, they tend not to trade or hedge, thus lowering rates volumes across cash and derivatives markets industry-wide. Major central banks such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, ECB, Bank of Japan, Bank of England, and Swiss National Bank continue to maintain historically low interest rates through quantitative easing programs, keeping key short-term interest rates low, or a combination of both. Even with the Federal Reserve unwind, the overall dollar value of balance sheets of the G-4 (the U.S., Eurozone, Japan, and U.K.) is expected to remain high as a percentage of G-4 GDP over the near term. Largely as a result of quantitative easing and expectations of continued low inflation, the yield on Germany's 10-year bond was (0.19)% and the yield on Japan's 10-year bond was (0.02)% as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2019.\nRevenues\n\n Long-term debt and collateralized borrowings reflect long-term borrowings of $300.0 million of the 5.125% Senior Notes due on May 27, 2021 (the $300.0 million represents the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the 5.125% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $298.7 million), $450.0 million of the 5.375% Senior Notes due on July 24, 2023 (the $450.0 million represents the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $445.2 million), $300.0 million of the 3.750% Senior Notes due October 1, 2024 (the $300.0 million represents the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $296.1 million), $70.0 million of borrowings under the committed unsecured senior Revolving Credit Agreement due February 26, 2021 (the $70.0 million represents \nOur rates business is focused on government debt, futures and currency, and both listed and OTC interest rate derivatives, which are among the largest, most global and most actively traded markets. The main drivers of these markets are global macroeconomic forces such as growth, inflation, government budget policies and new issuances.\n\n \u2022 an adjustment of the exchange mechanism between the Newmark IPO and the Distribution so that one exchangeable BGC Holdings unit together with a number of exchangeable Newmark Holdings units equal to 0.4545 divided by the Newmark Holdings Exchange Ratio as of such time, must be exchanged in order to receive one share of BGC Class A common stock; and \nShort-term Borrowings\n the principal amount of the debt; the carrying value of the committed unsecured senior Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $68.9 million), $11.7 million of collateralized borrowings due May 31, 2021, $13.2 million of collateralized borrowings due April 8, 2023, and $8.8 million of collateralized borrowings due April 19, 2023. See Note 18- Notes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding these obligations, including timing of payments and compliance with debt covenants. \nIn recent years, there has been significant consolidation among the interdealer-brokers and wholesale brokers with which we compete. In addition to our 2015 acquisition of GFI, Tullett and ICAP announced in November 2015 an agreement whereby Tullett would purchase the vast majority of ICAP's global Voice/Hybrid broking, as well as portions of its information businesses. Following the completion of this deal in December 2016, ICAP changed its corporate name to NEX, and Tullett changed its name to TP ICAP plc. CME announced in March 2018 that it had agreed to acquire NEX and completed the acquisition in November 2018. We expect to continue to compete with the electronic markets, post-trade and information businesses of NEX, that are part of CME now, through the various offerings on our Fenics platform. We will also continue to compete with TP ICAP across various Voice/Hybrid brokerage marketplaces as well as via Fenics. There has also been significant consolidation among smaller non-public wholesale brokers, including our acquisitions of RP Martin, Heat Energy Group, Remate Lince and Sunrise Brokers Group. We view the recent consolidation in the industry favorably, as we expect it to provide additional operating leverage to our businesses in the future.\nHIRING AND ACQUISITIONS\n\nOur average revenue per front-office employee has historically declined year-over-year for the period immediately following significant headcount increases, and the additional brokers and salespeople generally achieve significantly higher productivity levels in their second or third year with the Company. Excluding our insurance brokerage business, as of December 31, 2019, our front-office headcount was 2,570 brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel, up 1% from 2,553 a year ago. Compared to the prior year, average revenue per front-office employee for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased by 1% to $750 thousand from $760 thousand. On a stand-alone basis, our total insurance brokerage headcount increased by 122% to 591 from 266 a year ago.\nChanges in shares of the Company's Class A common stock outstanding were as follows (in thousands):\nFees to Related Parties\nWe have entered into various agreements with certain of our employees and partners, whereby these individuals receive loans which may be either wholly or in part repaid from the distribution earnings that the individual receives on their LPUs or may be forgiven over a period of time. The forgivable portion of these loans is recognized as compensation expense over the life of the loan. From time to time, we may also enter into agreements with employees and partners to grant bonus and salary advances or other types of loans. These advances and loans are repayable in the timeframes outlined in the underlying agreements.\nRates Volumes and Volatility\nIndustry Consolidation\nCollectively, our newer Fenics offerings, such as the five listed above, are not yet fully up to scale, and are not yet generating significant revenues. The net loss relating to investment in these new products and services was more than $55 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect the net loss relating to these investments in Fenics offerings to improve by $15 million in 2020 and for the net loss to be approximately $40 million, and for these newer businesses to break even during 2021. Over time, we expect these new products and services to become profitable, high-margin businesses as their scale and revenues increase, all else equal. We believe that our newer Fenics offerings have created significant shareholder value.\n \u2022 an apportionment of the existing economic attributes (including, among others, capital accounts and post-termination payments) of each BGC Holdings limited partnership interests outstanding immediately prior to the Separation between such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit and the fraction of a Newmark Holdings LPU issued in the Separation in respect of such Legacy BGC Holdings Unit, based on the relative value of BGC and Newmark as of after the Newmark IPO; \nBecause revenue per broker is not a widely used or relevant statistic for the insurance brokerage industry, BGC will provide statistics with respect to front-office staff excluding this business beginning in the first quarter of 2020.\nFees from Related Parties\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\nExpenses\nIn November 2008, we entered into a clearing capital agreement with Cantor to clear U.S. Treasury and U.S. government agency securities transactions on our behalf. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, so long as Cantor is providing clearing services to us, Cantor shall be entitled to request from us, and we shall post as soon as practicable, cash or other property acceptable to Cantor in the amount reasonably requested by Cantor under the clearing capital agreement. Cantor had not requested any cash or other property from us as collateral as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate balance of employee loans, net of reserve, was $315.6 million and $216.9 million, respectively, and is included as Loans, forgivable loans and other receivables from employees and partners, net\u201d in our consolidated statements of financial condition. Compensation expense for the above-mentioned employee loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $35.7 million, $13.0 million and $26.9 million, respectively. The compensation expense related to these loans was included as part of Compensation and employee benefits\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest expense decreased by $35.2 million, or 45.8%, to $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. The decrease was primarily driven by lower interest expense on the $300.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes, and the $112.5 million 8.125% Senior Notes, both of which were assumed by Newmark as part of the December 2017 Separation Agreement, as well as lower interest expense on the $240.0 million 8.375% Senior Notes which were repaid in July 2018. In addition, lower interest expense on the $575.0 million Senior Term Loan, and the $400.0 million credit facility, partially offset by an increase in interest expense on the $450.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 issued in July 2018.\n During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company redeemed 1.4 million LPUs at an aggregate redemption price of $8.0 million for a weighted-average price of $5.92 per unit and 0.1 million FPUs at an aggregate redemption price of $0.3 million for a weighted-average price of $5.64 per unit. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company redeemed approximately 9.2 million LPUs at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $116.5 million for a weighted-average price of $12.61 per unit and approximately 0.1 million FPUs at an aggregate redemption price of approximately $1.4 million for a weighted-average price of $12.86 per unit. The table above does not include units redeemed/cancelled in connection with the grant of 10.1 million and 6.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, nor the limited partnership interests exchanged for 4.4 million and 2.6 million shares of BGC Class A common stock during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. \nFor more information about these transactions, see Note 1- Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nEnergy and Commodities\nOur brokerage revenues from energy and commodities increased by $58.4 million, or 25.6%, to $286.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, as well as organic growth, partially offset by the sale of CSC Commodities.\nIn response to motions to dismiss filed by all defendants in December 2018, Plaintiffs filed a motion for leave to amend the operative complaint in February 2019, requesting that the Court allow them to supplement their allegations, which the Court granted. The amended complaint alleges the same purported breaches of fiduciary duty as the operative complaint, raises no new claims, and seeks identical relief, but includes additional allegations, including alleged reasons for plaintiffs' failure to make a demand on the Board, which was the basis of defendants' motion to dismiss. On March 19, 2019, all defendants filed motions to dismiss the amended complaints, again on demand grounds. On September 30, 2019, the Court denied defendants' motions to dismiss, permitting the case to move forward into discovery. In its ruling, the Court determined that the amended complaint sufficiently pled that plaintiffs were not required to make demand on the Board in order to file a derivative suit, but did not make findings of fact with respect to the underlying merits of plaintiffs' allegations concerning the Transaction.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we had income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $138.1 million compared to income (loss) from operations before income taxes of $179.8 million in the year earlier period. Total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased $166.4 million to $2,104.2 million primarily led by our energy and commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes, rates, and credit businesses.\nWe have continued to invest in our new Fenics stand-alone Fully Electronic offerings, which currently include:\nCertain LPUs are granted exchangeability into our Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis (subject to adjustment). At the time exchangeability is granted, the Company recognizes an expense based on the fair value of the award on that date, which is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nDERIVATIVE SUIT\nFX\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into arrangements with unconsolidated entities, including variable interest entities. See Note 15- Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our investments in unconsolidated entities.\n5.375% Senior Notes\nOn November 28, 2018, we entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement which replaced the existing committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement. The maturity date of the new Revolving Credit Agreement was November 28, 2020 and the maximum revolving loan balance has been reduced from $400.0 million to $350.0 million. Borrowings under this agreement bear interest at either LIBOR or a defined base rate plus additional margin. On December 11, 2019, we entered into an amendment to the new unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the maturity date was extended to February 26, 2021. There was no change to the interest rate or the maximum revolving loan balance. On February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a second amendment to the unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement, pursuant to which, the maturity date was extended by two years to February 26, 2023. The size of the Revolving Credit Agreement, along with the interest rate on the borrowings therefrom, remained unchanged. As of December 31, 2019, there was $68.9 million of borrowings outstanding, net of deferred financing costs of $1.1 million, under the new unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement. The average interest rate on the outstanding borrowings was 3.88% for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSee Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nOther Revenues\nThe Board and Audit Committee have authorized repurchases of BGC Class A common stock and redemptions of limited partnership interests or other equity interests in our subsidiaries. On August 1, 2018, the Company's Board and Audit Committee increased the Company's share repurchase and unit redemption authorization to $300.0 million, which may include purchases from Cantor, its partners or employees or other affiliated persons or entities. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had $256.7 million remaining from its share repurchase and unit redemption authorization. From time to time, the Company may actively continue to repurchase shares and/or redeem units.\nRestricted Stock: Restricted stock provided to certain employees is accounted for as an equity award, and as per the U.S. GAAP guidance, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the restricted stock that is ultimately expected to vest. We have granted restricted stock that is not subject to continued employment or service; however, transferability is subject to compliance with our and our affiliates' customary noncompete obligations. Such shares of restricted stock are generally saleable by partners in five to ten years. Because the restricted stock is not subject to continued employment or service, the grant-date fair value of the restricted stock is expensed on the date of grant. The expense is reflected as non-cash equity-based compensation expense in our consolidated statements of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019 there was no net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we had net income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries of $52.4 million.\nHistorically, our technology-based product growth has led to higher margins and greater profits over time for exchanges and wholesale financial intermediaries alike, even if overall Company revenues remain consistent. This is largely because automated and electronic trading efficiency allows the same number of employees to manage a greater volume of trades as the marginal cost of incremental trading activity falls. Over time, the conversion of exchange-traded and OTC markets to Fully Electronic trading has also led, on average, to volumes increasing by enough to offset commission declines, and thus often to similar or higher overall revenues. We have been a pioneer in creating and encouraging Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution, and we continually work with our customers to expand such trading across more asset classes and geographies.\nFunding\n Hybrid is defined as transactions involving some element of electronic trading but executed by BGC's brokers, exclusive of voice-only transactions. Fully electronic involves customer-to-customer trades, free from broker execution. \nUNIT REDEMPTIONS AND EXCHANGES-EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nWe earn other revenues from various sources, including underwriting and advisory fees.\nOur rates business is influenced by a number of factors, including global sovereign issuances, secondary trading and the hedging of these sovereign debt instruments. The amount of global sovereign debt outstanding remains high by historical standards, and the level of secondary trading and related hedging activity was mixed during 2019. In addition, according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the average daily volume of various U.S. Treasuries, excluding Treasury bills, among primary dealers was 7% higher in 2019 as compared to a year earlier. Additionally, interest rate derivative volumes were down 13% and up 4% at ICE and the CME, respectively, all according to company press releases. In comparison, our revenue from Fenics Fully Electronic rates increased 13.7%, while our overall rates revenues were up 8.2% as compared to a year earlier to $594.9 million.\nExpenses\nWe provide our brokerage services in a wide range of credit instruments, including asset-backed securities, convertible bonds, corporate bonds, credit derivatives and high yield bonds.\nFollowing the Spin-Off, external data providers have restated the historical prices of BGC Class A common stock (BGCP). As such, the nominal prices listed in the footnotes above may not match the historical prices listed on such data services following the Spin-Off.\nCredit ratings and associated outlooks are influenced by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: operating environment, earnings and profitability trends, the prudence of funding and liquidity management practices, balance sheet size/composition and resulting leverage, cash flow coverage of interest, composition and size of the capital base, available liquidity, outstanding borrowing levels and the firm's competitive position in the industry. A credit rating and/or the associated outlook can be revised upward or downward at any time by a rating agency if such rating agency decides that circumstances warrant such a change. Any reduction in our credit ratings and/or the associated outlooks could adversely affect the availability of debt financing on terms acceptable to us, as well as the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain any such financing. In addition, credit ratings and associated outlooks may be important to customers or counterparties when we compete in certain markets and when we seek to engage in certain transactions. In connection with certain agreements, we may be required to provide additional collateral in the event of a credit ratings downgrade.\n\nProfessional and consulting fees increased by $8.1 million, or 9.6%, to $92.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by fees attributed to the acquisitions of Ed Broking and Poten & Partners, and an increase in legal fees, which was partially offset by a decrease in consulting fees, notably with regards to the implementation of MiFID II during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nFees from Related Parties\nEXECUTIVE COMPENSATION-INCENTIVE PLAN\nREGULATORY ENVIRONMENT\n \u2022 Lucera, which is our software-defined network, offering the trading community direct connectivity to each other; and \n \u2022 Capitalab's Nikkei 225 options compression service, which is in partnership with the Singapore Exchange. \nAs part of our cash management process, we may enter into tri-party reverse repurchase agreements and other short-term investments, some of which may be with Cantor. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no reverse repurchase agreements outstanding.\nCommissions and floor brokerage expense increased by $18.8 million, or 43.5%, to $61.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This line item tends to move in line with brokerage revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, there was a gain of $18.4 million as a result of the sale of CSC Commodities. We had no gains or losses from divestitures or sale of investments in the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRevenues\nWe previously offered real estate services through our publicly traded subsidiary, Newmark (NASDAQ: NMRK). On November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of Newmark (see Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off\u201d for more information).\nUnder rules adopted by the CFTC, all foreign introducing brokers engaging in transactions with U.S. persons are required to register with the NFA and either meet financial reporting and net capital requirements on an individual basis or obtain a guarantee agreement from a registered Futures Commission Merchant. Our European-based brokers engage from time to time in interest rate swap transactions with U.S.-based counterparties, and therefore we are subject to the CFTC requirements. CF&Co has entered into guarantees on our behalf (and on behalf of GFI), and we are required to indemnify CF&Co for the amounts, if any, paid by CF&Co on our behalf pursuant to this arrangement. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recorded expenses of $125,000 with respect to these guarantees.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nOn April 8, 2019, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $15.0 million, under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.77% and matures on April 8, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, we had $13.2 million outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement. The net book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2019 was $8.1 million. Also, on April 19, 2019, we entered into a secured loan arrangement of $10.0 million, under which it pledged certain fixed assets as security for a loan. This arrangement incurs interest at a fixed rate of 3.89% and matures on April 19, 2023. As of December 31, 2019, we had $8.8 million outstanding related to this secured loan arrangement. The book value of the fixed assets pledged as of December 31, 2019 was $5.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\nCertain LPUs have a stated vesting schedule and do not receive quarterly allocations of net income. Compensation expense related to these LPUs is recognized over the stated service period, and these units generally vest between two and five years. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we incurred compensation expense related to these LPUs of $36.7 million, $11.4 million, and $1.2 million, respectively. This expense is included in Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nLIQUIDITY\n As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $13.9 million and $15.1 million, respectively, of Marketable securities on our balance sheet had been lent in a Securities loaned transaction and, therefore, are not included in this Liquidity Analysis. \nOther Income (Losses), Net\nOther Income (Loss)\nOVERVIEW AND BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n Common stock consisted of Class A shares, Class B shares and contingent shares for which all necessary conditions have been satisfied except for the passage of time. For the quarter ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average number of Class A shares was 305.5 million and Class B shares was 45.9 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the weighted-average number of Class A shares was 298.4 and Class B shares was 45.9 million. \nLIQUIDITY ANALYSIS\nClass B Common Stock\nClass A Common Stock\nWhen reviewing goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill. If the results of the qualitative assessment are not conclusive, or if we choose to bypass the qualitative assessment, we perform a goodwill impairment analysis using a two-step process as follows.\n5.125% Senior Notes\nBrokerage Revenues\nProfessional and consulting fees increased by $20.7 million, or 32.7%, to $84.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in consulting services in 2018.\nFees to related parties decreased by $0.8 million, or 4.0%, to $19.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Fees to related parties are allocations paid to Cantor for administrative and support services (such as accounting, occupancy, and legal).\nOn January 12, 2016, we completed our acquisition of GFI, a leading intermediary and provider of trading technologies and support services to the global OTC and listed markets, via the GFI Merger. GFI serves institutional clients in operating electronic and hybrid markets for cash and derivative products across multiple asset classes.\nGains (losses) on equity method investments decreased by $3.3 million, to a gain of $4.1 million, for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to a gain of $7.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Gains (losses) on equity method investments represent our pro-rata share of the net gains or losses on investments over which we have significant influence, but which we do not control.\nThe majority of our operating costs consist of cash and non-cash compensation expenses, which include base salaries, broker bonuses based on broker production, guaranteed bonuses, other discretionary bonuses, and all related employee benefits and taxes. Our employees consist of brokers, salespeople, executives and other administrative support. The majority of our brokers receive a base salary and a formula bonus based primarily on a pool of brokers' production for a particular product or sales desk, as well as on the individual broker's performance. Members of our sales force receive either a base salary or a draw on commissions. Less experienced salespeople typically receive base salaries and bonuses.\nWe offer our brokerage services in seven broad product categories: rates, credit, FX, energy & commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes. The chart below details brokerage revenues by product category and by Voice/Hybrid versus Fully Electronic (in thousands):\nFenics Market Data is a supplier of real-time, tradable, indicative, end-of-day and historical market data. Our market data product suite includes fixed income, interest rate derivatives, credit derivatives, FX, FX options, money markets, energy and equity derivatives and structured market data products and services. The data are sourced from the Voice, Hybrid and Fully Electronic broking operations, as well as the market data operations, including BGC, GFI and RP Martin, among others. It is made available to financial professionals, research analysts and other market participants via direct data feeds and BGC-hosted FTP environments, as well as via information vendors such as Bloomberg, Thomson Reuters, ICE Data Services, QUICK Corp., and other select specialist vendors.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOn March 27, 2019, the Audit and Compensation Committees authorized the purchase by the Company from Stephen M. Merkel of up to 250,000 shares of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on March 26, 2019. Pursuant to this authorization, 233,172 shares of BGC Class A common stock were purchased by the Company on March 27, 2019 at $5.30 per share, the closing price on March 26, 2019.\nWe provide brokerage services in a range of markets for equity products, including cash equities, equity derivatives (both listed and OTC), equity index futures and options on equity products as well as insurance products.\nData, software and post-trade revenues increased by $10.6 million, or 19.5%, to $65.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by new business contracts in 2018.\nTotal expenses increased $205.8 million to $2,021.6 million, primarily due to a $118.9 million increase in non-compensation expenses driven by the impact of acquisitions; expenses related to the Company's previously disclosed settlements with the CFTC and the NYAG; interest expense associated with increased borrowing; and the Company's increased investment in technology. The increase in non-compensation expenses was also impacted by rent during the build-out of BGC's new U.K.-based headquarters, which was recently completed. Compensation expenses increased by $86.8 million, which was primarily driven by the impact of recent acquisitions.\nFrom 2014 through 2016, the FASB issued several accounting standard updates, which together comprise ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Beginning in the first quarter of 2018, the Company began recording its financial results to conform to ASC 606. ASC 606 does not currently materially impact the results of BGC. The consolidated Company has elected to adopt the guidance using the modified retrospective approach to ASC 606, under which the consolidated Company applied the new standard only to new contracts initiated on or after January 1, 2018 and recorded the transition adjustments as part of Total equity\u201d.\nThe Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Partnership Agreement also removes certain classes of BGC Holdings units that are no longer outstanding, and permits the general partner of BGC Holdings to determine the total number of authorized BGC Holdings units. The Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement was approved by the Audit Committee.\nOur brokerage revenues from rates increased by $45.1 million, or 8.2%, to $594.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in rates revenues was primarily driven by higher global volumes and improvement in our Fully Electronic rates business, which was a result of our continued investment in technology and the ongoing conversion of our businesses to more profitable Fully Electronic execution.\nNet income (loss) from discontinued operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries increased by $58.3 million to $52.4 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in earnings.\nCredit Volumes\nThe initial carrying value of the 8.125% Senior Notes was $108.7 million, net of debt issuance costs of $3.8 million. On December 13, 2017, Newmark OpCo assumed all of the BGC U.S. OpCo's rights and obligations under the 2042 Promissory Note. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the Company in full for the 2042 Promissory Note, and the Company subsequently repaid the 8.125% Senior Notes on September 5, 2018.\nWe incur income tax expenses or benefit based on the location, legal structure and jurisdictional taxing authorities of each of our subsidiaries. Certain of the Company's entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to the UBT in New York City. U.S. federal and state income tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss, with the exception of UBT, rests with the partners (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d for discussion of partnership interests), rather than the partnership entity. The Company's consolidated financial statements include U.S. federal, state and local income taxes on the Company's allocable share of the U.S. results of operations. Outside of the U.S., we operate principally through subsidiary corporations subject to local income taxes.\nPURCHASE OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS\nEquity-Based Compensation and Allocations of Net Income to Limited Partnership Units and FPUs\nCommunications\nDiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2019\nWe earn revenues from our brokerage services on both an agency and matched principal basis. In agency transactions, we charge a commission for connecting buyers and sellers and assisting in the negotiation of the price and other material terms of the transaction. After all material terms of a transaction are agreed upon, we identify the buyer and seller to each other and leave them to settle the trade directly. Principal transaction revenues are primarily derived from matched principal transactions, whereby revenues are earned on the spread between the buy and the sell price of the brokered security, commodity or derivative. Customers either see the buy or sell price on a screen or are given this information over the phone. The brokerage fee is then added to the buy or sell price, which represents the spread we earn as principal transactions revenues. On a limited basis, we enter into unmatched principal transactions to facilitate a customer's execution needs for transactions initiated by such customers. We also provide market data products for selected financial institutions.\nBGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange, our subsidiaries, began operating as SEFs on October 2, 2013. Both BGC Derivative Markets and GFI Swaps Exchange received permanent registration approval from the CFTC as SEFs on January 22, 2016. Mandatory Dodd-Frank Act compliant execution on SEFs by eligible U.S. persons commenced in February 2014 for made available to trade\u201d products, and a wide range of other rules relating to the execution and clearing of derivative products have been finalized with implementation periods in 2016 and beyond. We also own ELX, which became a dormant contract market on July 1, 2017.\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method as prescribed in the U.S. GAAP guidance, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to basis differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Certain of our entities are taxed as U.S. partnerships and are subject to UBT in the City of New York. Therefore, the tax liability or benefit related to the partnership income or loss except for UBT rests with the partners (see Note 2- Limited Partnership Interests in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings\u201d for a discussion of partnership interests), rather than the partnership entity. As such, the partners' tax liability or benefit is not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. The tax-related assets, liabilities, provisions or benefits included in our consolidated financial statements also reflect the results of the entities that are taxed as corporations, either in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe increase in total brokerage revenues was primarily driven by increases in revenues from energy and commodities, equities, insurance, and other asset classes, rates, and credit, partially offset by a decrease in revenues from FX.\nWe and Cantor have agreed that any shares of BGC Class B common stock issued in connection with the Exchange Agreement would be deducted from the aggregate number of shares of BGC Class B common stock that may be issued to the Cantor entities upon exchange of Cantor units in BGC Holdings. Accordingly, the Cantor entities will not be entitled to receive any more shares of BGC Class B Stock under this agreement than they were previously eligible to receive upon exchange of Cantor units.\nOn September 8, 2017, we entered into the Term Loan. The Term Loan provided for loans of up to $575.0 million. The maturity date of the Term Loan was September 8, 2019. On November 22, 2017, we and Newmark entered into an amendment to the Term Loan. Pursuant to the Term Loan amendment and effective as of December 13, 2017, Newmark assumed the obligations of the Company as borrower under the Term Loan. There was no change in the maturity date or interest rate. As of December 31, 2017, Newmark had $270.7 million borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the outstanding balance of $270.7 million at which point the facility was terminated. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan.\nOur results from continuing operations exclude the results of Newmark for all periods due to the Spin-Off. During the year ended December 31, 2019, BGC's revenues increased 8.6%, to $2,104.2 million. This growth was largely due to an increase in brokerage revenues, which were up by 7.8% to $1,967.7 million. In addition, our data, software, and post-trade revenues increased by 12.2% from a year ago to $73.2 million. Income from operations before income taxes decreased by $41.7 million to $138.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOn October 11, 2019, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4, which was declared effective by the SEC on October 24, 2019. On October 28, 2019, BGC launched an exchange offer in which holders of the 3.750% Senior Notes, issued in a private placement on September 27, 2019 may exchange such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms. The exchange offer closed on December 9, 2019 at which point the initial 3.750% Senior Notes were exchanged for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nThe FCA is the relevant statutory regulator in the U.K. The FCA's objectives are to protect customers, maintain the stability of the financial services industry and promote competition between financial services providers. It has broad rule-making, investigative and enforcement powers derived from the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and subsequent and derivative legislation and regulations.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the monetization of 760,797 PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick (which at an average determination price of $6.57 per share on such date, had a value of $5,000,000). On February 1, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved a modification which consisted of the following: (i) the right to exchange 376,651 non-exchangeable PSUs held by Mr. Lutnick into 376,651 non-exchangeable HDUs (which, based on the closing price of BGC Class A common stock of $6.21 per share on such date, had a value of $2,339,000); and (ii) the right to exchange for cash 463,969 non-exchangeable PPSUs held by Mr. Lutnick, for a payment of $2,661,000 for taxes when (i) is exchanged.\nOur balance sheet and business model are not capital intensive. Our assets consist largely of cash, collateralized and uncollateralized short-dated receivables and less liquid assets needed to support our business. Longer-term capital (equity and notes payable) is held to support the less liquid assets and potential capital investment opportunities. Total assets as of December 31, 2019 were $3.9 billion, an increase of 14.1% as compared to December 31, 2018. The increase in total assets was driven primarily by increases in Cash segregated under regulatory requirements, Accrued commissions and other receivables, net and less liquid assets, including ROU assets for leases. We maintain a significant portion of our assets in Cash and cash equivalents and Securities owned, with our liquidity (which we define as Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements) as of December 31, 2019 of $473.2 million. See Liquidity Analysis\u201d below for a further discussion of our liquidity. Our Securities owned were $57.5 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $58.4 million as of December 31, 2018. Our Marketable securities decreased to $14.2 million as of December 31, 2019, compared to $32.1 million as of December 31, 2018. We did not have any Reverse repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. We had Securities loaned of $13.9 million and no Repurchase agreements as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2018, we had Securities loaned of $15.1 million and Repurchase agreements of $1.0 million.\nOn June 26, 2012, we issued an aggregate of $112.5 million principal amount of 8.125% Senior Notes due 2042. The 8.125% Senior Notes were senior unsecured obligations. The 8.125% Senior Notes were redeemable for cash, in whole or in part, on or after June 26, 2017, at our option, at any time and from time to time, until maturity at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be redeemed, plus accrued but unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to, but not including, the redemption date. The 8.125% Senior Notes were listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol BGCA.\u201d We used the proceeds to repay short-term borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. In connection with the issuance of the 8.125% Senior Notes, the Company lent the proceeds of the 8.125% Senior Notes to BGC U.S. OpCo, and BGC U.S. OpCo issued the 2042 Promissory Note.\nOn June 5, 2015, we entered into the Exchange Agreement with Cantor providing Cantor, CFGM and other Cantor affiliates entitled to hold BGC Class B common stock the right to exchange from time to time, on a one-to-one basis, subject to adjustment, up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of BGC Class A common stock now owned or subsequently acquired by such Cantor entities for up to an aggregate of 34,649,693 shares of BGC Class B common stock. Such shares of BGC Class B common stock, which currently can be acquired upon the exchange of Cantor units owned in BGC Holdings, are already included in our fully diluted share count and will not increase Cantor's current maximum potential voting power in the common equity. The Exchange Agreement enabled the Cantor entities to acquire the same number of shares of BGC Class B common stock that they were already entitled to acquire without having to exchange its Cantor units in BGC Holdings. The Audit Committee and Board have determined that it was in the best interests of us and our stockholders to approve the Exchange Agreement because it will help ensure that Cantor retains its Cantor units in BGC Holdings, which is the same partnership in which our partner employees participate, thus continuing to align the interests of Cantor with those of the partner employees. On November 23, 2018, in the Class B Issuance, BGC issued 10,323,366 shares of BGC Class B common stock to Cantor and 712,907 shares of BGC Class B common stock to CFGM, an affiliate of Cantor, in each case in exchange for shares of BGC Class A common stock from Cantor and CFGM, respectively, on a one-to-one basis pursuant to the Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B issuance was exempt from the Securities Act. Following this exchange, Cantor and its affiliates only have the right to exchange under the Exchange Agreement up to an aggregate of 23,613,420 shares of BGC Class A common stock, now owned or subsequently acquired, or its Cantor units in BGC Holdings, into shares of BGC Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2019, Cantor and CFGM do not own any shares of BGC Class A common stock.\nProvision (Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOn January 12, 2016, we completed the two-step GFI Merger. The GFI Merger allowed BGC to acquire the remaining approximately 33% of the outstanding shares of GFI common stock that BGC did not already own. Following the closing of the GFI Merger, BGC and its affiliates owned 100% of the outstanding shares of GFI's common stock.\nInterest Income\nGains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments\nNet Income (Loss) From Continuing Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nSince 2017, our acquisitions have included Besso, Poten & Partners, Ed Broking, Ginga Petroleum and several smaller acquisitions.\nDue largely to the impacts of the global financial crises of 2008-2009, our businesses had faced more challenging market conditions from 2009 until the second half of 2016. Accommodative monetary policies were enacted by several major central banks, including the Federal Reserve, Bank of England, Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank, in response to the global financial crises. These policies have resulted in historically low levels of volatility and interest rates across many of the financial markets in which we operate. The global credit markets also faced structural issues, such as increased bank capital requirements under Basel III. Consequently, these factors contributed to lower trading volumes in our rates and credit asset classes across most geographies in which we operated.\nThe table below presents our Liquidity Analysis as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018:\nOur rates revenues increased by $38.9 million, or 7.6%, to $549.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in rates revenues reflected strong improvement in our Fully Electronic rates business, which was a result of our continued investment in technology and the ongoing conversion of our businesses to more profitable Fully Electronic execution.\nCantor has the right to purchase limited partnership interests (Cantor units) from BGC Holdings upon redemption of non-exchangeable FPUs redeemed by BGC Holdings upon termination or bankruptcy of the Founding/Working Partner. In addition, pursuant to Article Eight, Section 8.08, of the Second Amended and Restated BGC Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement (previously the sixth amendment) and Article Eight, Section 8.08, of the Newmark Holdings Limited Partnership Agreement, where either current, terminating, or terminated partners are permitted by the Company to exchange any portion of their FPUs and Cantor consents to such exchangeability, the Company shall offer to Cantor the opportunity for Cantor to purchase the same number of new exchangeable limited partnership interests (Cantor units) in BGC Holdings at the price that Cantor would have paid for the FPUs had the Company redeemed them. Any such Cantor units purchased by Cantor are currently exchangeable for up to 23,613,420 shares of BGC Class B common stock or, at Cantor's election or if there are no such additional shares of BGC Class B common stock, shares of BGC Class A common stock, in each case on a one-for-one basis (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments).\nPrimarily in the U.S., we pay fees to Cantor for performing certain administrative and other support services, including charges for occupancy of office space, utilization of fixed assets and accounting, operations, human resources, legal services and technology infrastructure support. Management believes that these charges are a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services rendered. However, the expenses for these services are not necessarily indicative of the expenses that would have been incurred if we had not obtained these services from Cantor. In addition, these charges may not reflect the costs of services we may receive from Cantor in the future. We incur commissions and floor brokerage fees for clearing, brokerage and other transactional expenses for clearing and settlement services. We also incur various other normal operating expenses.\n \u2022 Fenics GO, our new electronic trading platform, which provides live, real-time and tradeable two-way electronic liquidity for exchange-listed futures and options, such as Eurex EURO STOXX 50 Index Options, NIKKEI 225, and related Delta One strategies. Fenics GO recently added Citadel Securities, who joined IMC, Maven Securities, and Optiver as electronic liquidity providers; \n \u2022 Our expanded Fenics FX platforms, including MidFX, Spot, FX Options, and non-deliverable and FX forwards; \nCommissions and floor brokerage expense increased by $1.7 million, or 2.8%, to $63.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This line item tends to move in line with brokerage revenues.\nEQUITY\nUnsecured Senior Revolving Credit Agreement\nOur liquidity analysis includes a comparison of our Consolidated net income (loss) adjusted for Consolidated net income from discontinued operations, net of tax and certain non-cash items (e.g., Equity-based compensation) as presented on the cash flow statement. Dividends and distributions are payments made to our holders of common shares and limited partnership interests and are related to earnings from prior periods. These timing differences will impact our cash flows in a given period.\nBGC, BGC Partners, BGC Trader, GFI, GFI Ginga, CreditMatch, Fenics, Fenics.com, Sunrise Brokers, Besso, Ed Broking, Poten & Partners, RP Martin, kACE2, EMBonds, Capitalab, Swaptioniser, CBID and Lucera are trademarks/service marks, and/or registered trademarks/service marks of BGC Partners, Inc. and/or its affiliates.\n Short-term borrowings reflects approximately $5.0 million (BRL 20.0 million) of borrowing under the Company's committed unsecured loan agreement. See Note 18- Notes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\u201d for more information regarding this obligation. \nCommissions and Floor Brokerage\nVolume is driven by a number of factors, including the level of issuance for financial instruments, price volatility of financial instruments, macro-economic conditions, creation and adoption of new products, regulatory environment, and the introduction and adoption of new trading technologies. Historically, increased price volatility has often increased the demand for hedging instruments, including many of the cash and derivative products that we broker.\nDiscussion of the year ended December 31, 2018\nOn November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of the shares of Newmark Class A and Class B common stock held by us to our stockholders as of the close of business on the Record Date through a special pro-rata stock dividend pursuant to which shares of Newmark Class A common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of BGC Class A common stock and shares of Newmark Class B common stock held by BGC were distributed to holders of BGC Class B common stock (which holders of BGC Class B common stock were Cantor and another entity controlled by our CEO, Howard W. Lutnick). Following the Spin-Off, BGC no longer holds any shares of Newmark.\n\nCREDIT RATINGS\nBelow is a brief analysis of the market and industry volumes for some of our products, including our overall Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution activities.\nRegulation\nInterest Income\nSee Note 3- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding these critical accounting policies and other significant accounting policies.\nEquity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs decreased by $28.2 million, or 12.1%, to $205.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in changes related to exchangeability and issuances of common stock.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company did not issue any shares of BGC Class B common stock during the year ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were 45,884,380 shares of BGC Class B common stock outstanding.\nOther expenses decreased by $5.8 million, or 8.3%, to $64.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, which was primarily related to lower costs associated with acquisitions in 2018 and a decrease in impairment charges and other provisions.\nWe are a leading global brokerage and financial technology company servicing the global financial markets.\nGrowth Drivers\nJOINT SERVICES AGREEMENT WITH CANTOR\nFees from related parties decreased by $3.0 million, or 11.1%, to $24.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 respond to competitive pressures. \n3.750% Senior Notes\n \u2022 Fenics UST, which generated volume growth of approximately 230% year-on-year in December 2019. This compares with a decline of 18% for overall primary dealer U.S. Treasury volumes. Primary dealer volumes are based on data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Over the same timeframe, Fenics UST increased its market share of CLOB trading from approximately 2% to nearly 10% and is now the second largest CLOB platform for U.S. Treasuries. CLOB market share is based on data from Greenwich Associates for the U.S. Treasury volumes of Fenics UST, CME BrokerTec, Nasdaq Fixed Income, and Dealerweb. Including these CLOB platforms as well as the volumes of platforms using other fully electronic U.S. Treasury trading protocols, Fenics UST increased its market share from 1.3% to 5.4% year-on-year in December 2019, per Greenwich Associates. \nThe fair value of RSU awards to employees is determined on the date of grant, based on the fair value of BGC Class A common stock. Generally, RSUs granted by us as employee compensation do not receive dividend equivalents; as such, we adjust the fair value of the RSUs for the present value of expected forgone dividends, which requires us to include an estimate of expected dividends as a valuation input. This grant-date fair value is amortized to expense ratably over the awards' vesting periods. For RSUs with graded vesting features, we have made an accounting policy election to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis. The amortization is reflected as part of Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nInterest income increased by $3.9 million, or 27.2%, to $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on deposits and an increase in dividend income.\nFor the purposes of this document and subsequent SEC filings, all of our Fully Electronic businesses are referred to as Fenics. The Fenics business includes our group of electronic brands offering a number of market infrastructure and connectivity services, Fully Electronic marketplaces, and the Fully Electronic brokerage of certain products that also may trade via Voice and Hybrid execution. The full suite of Fenics offerings include market data and related information services, Fully Electronic brokerage, compression and other post-trade services, analytics related to financial instruments and markets, and other financial technology solutions.\nMiFID II is intended to help improve the functioning of the EU single market by achieving a greater consistency of regulatory standards. By design, therefore, it is intended that EU member states should have very similar regulatory regimes in relation to the matters addressed to MiFID. MiFID II has also introduced a new regulated execution venue category known as an OTF that captures much of the Voice-and Hybrid-oriented trading in EU. Much of our existing EU derivatives and fixed income execution business now take place on OTFs. Brexit may impact future market structures and MiFID II rulemaking and implementation due to potential changes in mutual passporting between the U.K. and EU member states.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nEnergy and commodities volumes were generally higher during 2019 compared with the year earlier. According to the Futures Industry Association, the total contracts traded in energy and commodities futures were up 14% in 2019 compared to the previous year. Similarly, total contracts traded in energy and commodities options were up 16% over the same period. In comparison, BGC's energy and commodities revenues increased by 25.6% to $286.6 million, which was driven by the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ginga Petroleum, as well as organic growth, and partially offset by the sale of CSC.\nOn November 7, 2016, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 624,762 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 141,523 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $560,190, Cantor purchased 141,523 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $560,190. In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, on November 7, 2016, Cantor purchased 483,239 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $1,796,367 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange for 483,239 founding partner units. As a result of the Newmark IPO and the related Separation and Distribution Agreement, the aggregate exchangeable limited partnership units represent 624,762 and 283,983 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, respectively.\n5.375% Senior Notes due 2023\nFully electronic volume, including new products, was $25.0 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $23.2 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2018. Our hybrid volume for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $275.9 trillion, compared to $308.8 trillion for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe cash portion of our credit business is impacted by the level of global corporate bond issuance, while both the cash and credit derivatives sides of this business are impacted by sovereign and corporate issuance. The global credit derivative market turnover has declined over the last few years due to the introduction of rules and regulations around the clearing of credit derivatives in the U.S. and elsewhere, along with non-uniform regulation across different geographies. In addition, many of our large bank customers continue to reduce their inventory of bonds and other credit products in order to comply with Basel III and other international financial regulations. During 2019, primary dealer average daily volume for corporate bonds (excluding commercial paper) was up by 11% according to Bloomberg and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Total notional traded credit derivatives as reported by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association - a reflection of the OTC derivatives market - were down by 12%, from a year earlier. In comparison, our overall credit revenues were up by 5.0% to $306.7 million.\nAs described earlier in this document, on November 30, 2018, we completed the Spin-Off of Newmark. (See Newmark IPO, Separation Transaction and Spin-Off\u201d above for more information). As set forth in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, Newmark assumed certain BGC indebtedness and repaid such indebtedness. (See Notes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\u201d below for more information).\nAs of December 31, 2019, there were 1,749,347 FPUs in BGC Holdings remaining, which the partnerships had the right to redeem or exchange and with respect to which Cantor had the right to purchase an equivalent number of Cantor units.\nIn addition, the majority of our other foreign subsidiaries are subject to similar regulation by the relevant authorities in the countries in which they do business. Certain other of our foreign subsidiaries are required to maintain non-U.S. net capital requirements. For example, in Hong Kong, BGC Securities (Hong Kong), LLC, GFI (HK) Securities LLC and Sunrise Broker (Hong Kong) Limited are regulated by the Securities and Futures Commission. BGC Capital Markets (Hong Kong), Limited and GFI (HK) Brokers Ltd are regulated by The Hong Kong Monetary Authority. All are subject to Hong Kong net capital requirements. In France, Aurel BGC and BGC France Holdings; in Australia, BGC Partners (Australia) Pty Limited, BGC (Securities) Pty Limited and GFI Australia Pty Ltd.; in Japan, BGC Shoken Kaisha Limited's Tokyo branch and BGC Capital Markets Japan LLC's Tokyo Branch; in Singapore, BGC Partners (Singapore) Limited, and GFI Group Pte Ltd; in Korea, BGC Capital Markets & Foreign Exchange Broker (Korea) Limited and GFI Korea Money Brokerage Limited; and in Turkey, BGC Partners Menkul Degerler AS, all have net capital requirements imposed upon them by local regulators. In addition, the LCH (LIFFE/LME) clearing organization, of which BGC Brokers L.P. is a member, also imposes minimum capital requirements. In Latin America, BGC Liquidez Distribuidora De Titulos E Valores Mobiliarios Ltda. (Brazil) has net capital requirements imposed upon it by local regulators.\nNet Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nOther Revenues\nInterest Income\nThe U.K. and EU are currently negotiating a trade deal which, once signed, should determine the new bilateral trade relationship going forward. Given the short time period involved, it is not certain that such trade deal will be sufficiently comprehensive to encompass financial services. In case no new trade deal (or one incorporating financial services) is in place by the end of the transition period, absent mitigating legislative measures by individual EU member states, the trade relationship between the U.K. and the EU would be solely based on World Trade Organization terms. This could hinder current levels of mutual market access. While other trade deals are being considered, for example between the U.K. and the U.S., these may also prove challenging to negotiate and are unlikely to replace or compensate for a reduction, if any, in U.K. and EU trade at least in the short term. Further, the terms of a U.K. and EU trade deal may adversely impact the negotiation and terms of such other deals and vice versa.\nSelling and Promotion\nUnsecured Senior Term Loan Credit Agreement\nOur liquidity and available cash resources are restricted by regulatory requirements of our operating subsidiaries. Many of these regulators, including U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state securities commissions in the U.S., are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings that can result in civil and criminal judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, enhanced oversight, remediation, or other relief.\n8.375% Senior Notes\nThe Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017, which includes the global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, provision. This provision requires inclusion in the Company's U.S. income tax return the earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has elected to treat taxes associated with the GILTI provision using the Period Cost Method and thus has not recorded deferred taxes for basis differences under this regime.\nThe following table summarizes certain of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nOn August 23, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured credit agreement with Itau Unibanco S.A. The credit agreement provides for an intra-day overdraft credit line up to $12.4 million (BRL 50.0 million). The maturity date of the agreement is March 13, 2020. This facility bears a fee of 1.00% per year. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility.\n8.125% Senior Notes\nAs a wholesale intermediary in the financial services industry, our businesses are driven primarily by overall industry volumes in the markets in which we broker, the size and productivity of our front-office headcount (including brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel), regulatory issues, and the percentage of our revenues we are able to generate by Fully Electronic means.\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries decreased by $6.2 million, or 17.1%, to $30.0 million, for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Lynn with respect to 750,308 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $5.17 per share on such date, had a value of $3,879,092) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $3.894 per unit) of 287,888 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $1,120,909 for taxes. On February 22, 2019, the Compensation Committee approved the grant of exchange rights to Mr. Lynn with respect to an additional 43,131 non-exchangeable U.K. LPUs (which at the closing price of $6.26 per share on such date, had a value of $270,000) and the exchange for cash (at the average determination price of $4.1239 per unit) of 25,461 non-exchangeable PLPUs for a payment of $105,000 for taxes.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company has issued 0.3 million shares of its Class A common stock and paid $14.6 million in cash related to such contingent payments.\nRegistration Statements\nOn January 31, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Ed Broking, an independent Lloyd's of London insurance broker with a strong reputation across accident and health, aerospace, cargo, energy, financial and political risks, marine, professional and executive risks, property and casualty, specialty and reinsurance. Ed Broking has become part of the Company's overall insurance brokerage business.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. These accounting estimates require the use of assumptions about matters, some of which are highly uncertain at the time of estimation. To the extent actual experience differs from the assumptions used, our consolidated statements of financial condition, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows could be materially affected. We believe that the following accounting policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nThese subsidiaries may also be prohibited from repaying the borrowings of their parents or affiliates, paying cash dividends, making loans to their parent or affiliates or otherwise entering into transactions, in each case, that result in a significant reduction in their regulatory capital position without prior notification or approval from their principal regulator. See Note 22- Regulatory Requirements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for further details on our regulatory requirements.\nSummary of Results from Continuing Operations\nOther Income (Loss)\nOn September 27, 2019, we issued an aggregate of $300.0 million principal amount of 3.750% Senior Notes. The 3.750% Senior Notes are general unsecured obligations of the Company. The 3.750% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.750% per annum, payable on each April 1 and October 1, commencing April 1, 2020. The initial carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes was $296.1 million, net of discount and debt issuance costs of $3.9 million, of which $0.2 million are underwriting fees payable to CF&Co and $36 thousand are underwriting fees payable to CastleOak Securities, L.P. The issuance costs will be amortized as interest expense and the carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The carrying value of the 3.750% Senior Notes was $296.1 million as of December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our public long-term credit ratings and associated outlooks are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have issued and sold 17,401,431 shares of BGC Class A common stock (or $209.8 million) under the March 2018 Sales Agreement. As of December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018, we had sold all 20 million shares of BGC Class A common stock pursuant to each of the November 2014 Sales Agreement and April 2017 Sales Agreement. We intend to use the net proceeds of any shares of BGC Class A common stock sold for general corporate purposes for potential acquisitions, redemptions of LPUs and FPUs in BGC Holdings and repurchases of shares of BGC Class A common stock from partners, executive officers and other employees of ours or our subsidiaries and of Cantor and its affiliates. Certain of such partners will be expected to use the proceeds from such sales to repay outstanding loans issued by, or credit enhanced by, Cantor, or BGC Holdings. In addition to general corporate purposes, these sales along with our share repurchase authorization are designed as a planning device in order to facilitate the redemption process. Going forward, we may redeem units and reduce our fully diluted share count under our repurchase authorization or later sell shares of BGC Class A common stock under the March 2018 Sales Agreement.\nOn February 27, 2019, the Audit Committee authorized the purchase by Mr. Lutnick's retirement plan of up to $56,038 of BGC Class A common stock at the closing price on March 4, 2019. Pursuant to this authorization, 8,980 shares of BGC Class A common stock were purchased by the plan on March 5, 2019 at $6.24 per share, the closing price on March 4, 2019.\nOn December 31, 2018, the Compensation Committee approved the cancellation of 113,032 non-exchangeable PSUs held by Mr. Merkel, and the cancellation of 89,225 non-exchangeable PPSUs (which had a determination price of $5.36 per unit). In connection with these transactions, the Company issued $1,062,500 in BGC Class A common stock, less applicable taxes and withholdings at a 45% tax rate, resulting in 113,032 net shares of BGC Class A common stock at a price of $5.17 per share and the payment of $478,123 for taxes.\nOutside of U.S. Treasuries and spot FX, the banks and financial firms that dominate the OTC markets had, until recent years, generally been hesitant in adopting electronically traded products. However, the banks, broker-dealers, and other professional trading firms are now much more active in Hybrid and Fully Electronically traded markets across various OTC products, including credit derivative indices, FX derivatives, non-U.S. sovereign bonds, corporate bonds, and interest rate derivatives. These electronic markets have grown as a percentage of overall industry volumes for the past few years as firms like BGC have invested in the kinds of technology favored by our customers. Regulation in Asia, Europe and the U.S. regarding banking, capital markets, and OTC derivatives has accelerated the adoption of Fully Electronic execution, and we expect this to continue. We also believe that new clients, beyond our large bank customer base, will primarily transact electronically across our Fenics platform.\nQUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCommunications expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 1.1%, to $118.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. As a percentage of total revenues, communications slightly decreased from the prior year period.\n\nTotal brokerage revenues increased by $172.3 million, or 10.4%, to $1,824.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Commission revenues increased by $177.1 million, or 13.3%, to $1,511.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Principal transactions revenues decreased by $4.8 million, or 1.5%, to $313.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe following table provides certain volume and transaction count information for the quarterly periods indicated:\nAdditionally, in August 2013, the Audit Committee authorized us to invest up to $350 million in an asset-backed commercial paper program for which certain Cantor entities serve as placement agent and referral agent. The program issues short-term notes to money market investors and is expected to be used from time to time as a liquidity management vehicle. The notes are backed by assets of highly rated banks. We are entitled to invest in the program so long as the program meets investment policy guidelines, including policies relating to ratings. Cantor will earn a spread between the rate it receives from the short-term note issuer and the rate it pays to us on any investments in this program. This spread will be no greater than the spread earned by Cantor for placement of any other commercial paper note in the program. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had no investments in the program.\nNasdaq Transaction\nOur revenues are derived primarily from brokerage commissions charged for either agency or matched principal transactions, fees from related parties, fees charged for market data, analytics and post-trade products, fees from software solutions, and interest income.\nExpenses\nFees to related parties increased by $4.3 million, or 27.5%, to $20.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Fees to related parties are allocations paid to Cantor for administrative and support services (such as accounting, occupancy, and legal).\nAs of December 31, 2019, $561.9 million of net assets were held by regulated subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2019, these subsidiaries had aggregate regulatory net capital, as defined, in excess of the aggregate regulatory requirements, as defined, of $291.2 million.\nCredit\nThis discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition as of and during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. This discussion is provided to increase the understanding of, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report.\nOn June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum regarding continued membership in the EU. The exit from the EU is commonly referred to as Brexit. The Brexit vote passed by 51.9% to 48.1%. The U.K. subsequently formally left the EU on January 31, 2020, but its relationship with the bloc will remain in a transition period until December 31, 2020. During this period, the U.K. will, with some exceptions, remain subject to EU law. It will also maintain access to the EU's single market. If both the U.K. and the EU agree, this transition period may be extended once by up to two years, meaning it could remain in place until December 31, 2022. Such an extension must, however, be agreed upon before July 1, 2020. The U.K. government has ruled out any extension to the transition period and has legislated for a commitment not to agree to any extension. The government would then only be able to reverse that provision through new legislation.\nOther changes in working capital represent changes primarily in receivables and payables and accrued liabilities that impact our liquidity.\nImpact of ASC 606 on Results\n \u2022 increase the regulatory net capital necessary to support operations; \nOther expenses increased by $43.1 million, or 67.0%, to $107.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, which was primarily related to our previously disclosed settlements with the CFTC and the NYAG, as well as higher costs associated with the acquisitions of Poten & Partners and Ed Broking.\nWe had no gains or losses from divestitures or sale of investments in the year ended December 31, 2018. For the year ended December 31, 2017, there was a gain of $0.6 million related to the sale of investments.\nThe table below details our brokerage revenues by product category for the indicated periods (in thousands):\nOn November 7, 2017, the Company issued exchange rights with respect to, and Cantor purchased, in transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act, an aggregate of 1,179,788 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings, as follows: In connection with the redemption by BGC Holdings of an aggregate of 823,178 non-exchangeable founding partner units from founding partners of BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $2,828,629, Cantor purchased 823,178 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate of $2,828,629. In addition, pursuant to the Sixth Amendment, on November 7, 2017, Cantor purchased 356,610 exchangeable limited partnership units from BGC Holdings for an aggregate consideration of $1,091,175 in connection with the grant of exchangeability and exchange for 356,610 founding partner units. As a result of the Newmark IPO and the related Separation and Distribution Agreement, the aggregate exchangeable limited partnership units represent 1,179,788 and 536,267 exchangeable limited partnership units in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings, respectively.\nTotal brokerage revenues increased by $143.2 million, or 7.8%, to $1,967.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Commission revenues increased by $134.3 million, or 8.9%, to $1,645.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. Principal transactions revenues increased by $8.9 million, or 2.8%, to $321.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe laws and regulations passed or proposed on both sides of the Atlantic concerning OTC trading seem likely to favor increased use of technology by all market participants, and are likely to accelerate the adoption of both Hybrid and Fully Electronic execution. We believe these developments will favor the larger inter-dealer brokers over smaller, non-public local competitors, as the smaller players generally do not have the financial resources to invest the necessary amounts in technology. We believe this will lead to further consolidation across the wholesale financial brokerage industry, and thus allow us to profitably grow our front-office headcount.\n\n Operating leases are related to rental payments under various non-cancelable leases, principally for office space, net of sublease payments to be received. The total amount of sublease payments to be received is approximately $0.1 million over the life of the agreement. \n Other contractual obligations reflect commitments to make charitable contributions, which are recorded as part of Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities\u201d in the Company's consolidated statements of financial condition. The amount payable each year reflects an estimate of future Charity Day obligations. \nMiFID II requires a significant part of the market in these instruments to trade on trading venues subject to transparency regimes, not only in pre- and post-trade prices, but also in fee structures and access. In addition, it has impacted a number of key areas, including corporate governance, transaction reporting, pre- and post-trade transparency, technology synchronization, best execution and investor protection.\nOther Expenses\nOn February 5, 2020, the Board declared a 14 cent dividend for the fourth quarter. We anticipate having substantial resources with which to pay dividends, repurchase shares and/or units, profitably hire, and make accretive acquisitions, all with the goal of maintaining our investment grade rating.\nOn December 13, 2017, prior to the Newmark IPO, pursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, we transferred substantially all of the assets and liabilities relating to our Real Estate Services business to Newmark. In connection with the Separation, Newmark assumed certain indebtedness and made a proportional distribution of interests in Newmark Holdings to holders of interests in BGC Holdings.\nData, software and post-trade\nGlobal equity volumes were generally down during 2019. Research from Raymond James indicates that the average daily volumes of U.S. cash equities and U.S. options were down 4% and 5%, respectively, from a year ago. Over the same timeframe, average daily volumes of European cash equities were down 18% (in notional value), while Eurex average daily volumes of equity derivatives were up 4%. Our overall revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased by 14.3% to $409.2 million, which was driven by the acquisition of Ed Broking.\nOn November 15, 2018, we acquired Poten & Partners, a leading ship brokerage, consulting and business intelligence firm specializing in LNG, tanker and LPG markets. Founded over 80 years ago and with 170 employees worldwide, Poten & Partners provides its clients with valuable insight into the international oil, gas and shipping markets.\nIn addition, the GDPR came into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018 and creates new compliance obligations in relation to personal data. The GDPR may affect our practices, and will increase financial penalties for non-compliance significantly.\nOverall, analysts and economists expect the absolute level of sovereign debt outstanding to remain at elevated levels for the foreseeable future as governments finance their future deficits and roll over their sizable existing debt. Meanwhile, economists expect that the effects of various forms of quantitative easing undertaken by the various major central banks over the past several years will continue to negatively impact financial market volumes, as economic growth remains weak in most OECD countries. As a result, we expect long-term tailwinds in our rates business from continuing high levels of government debt, but continued near-term headwinds due to the current low interest rate environment and continued accommodative monetary policies globally.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nChanges in Reverse repurchase agreements, Securities owned, and Marketable securities may result from additional cash investments or sales, which will be offset by a corresponding change in Cash and cash equivalents and, accordingly, will not result in a change in our liquidity. Conversely, changes in the market value of such securities are reflected in our earnings or other comprehensive income (loss) and will result in changes in our liquidity.\n\nOn March 11, 2018, as part of 2017 year-end compensation, the BGC Compensation Committee authorized the Company to issue Mr. Lutnick $30.0 million of BGC Class A common stock, less applicable taxes and withholdings, based on a price of $14.33 per share, which was the closing price of BGC Class A common stock on the trading day prior to the date of issuance, which resulted in the net issuance of 979,344 shares of BGC Class A common stock. In exchange, the following equivalent units were redeemed and cancelled: an aggregate of 2,348,479 non-exchangeable LPUs of BGC Holdings consisting of 1,637,215 non-exchangeable BGC Holdings PSUs and 711,264 BGC Holdings PPSUs, having various determination prices per unit based on the date of the grant, and associated non-exchangeable LPUs of Newmark Holdings consisting of 774,566 of non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PSUs and 336,499 of non-exchangeable Newmark Holdings PPSUs.\nAdditional factors have weighed down market volumes in the products we broker. For example, the Basel III accord, implemented in late 2010 by the G-20 central banks, is a global regulatory framework on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk that was developed with the intention of making banks more stable in the wake of the financial crisis by increasing bank liquidity and reducing bank leverage. The accord, which is expected to be fully phased in as of January 1, 2022, has already required most large banks in G-20 nations to hold approximately three times as much Tier 1 capital as was required under the previous set of rules. These capital rules have made it more expensive for banks to hold non-sovereign debt assets on their balance sheets, and as a result, analysts say that banks have reduced their proprietary trading activity in corporate and asset-backed fixed income securities as well as in various other OTC cash and derivative instruments. We believe that this has further reduced overall market exposure and industry volumes in many of the products we broker, particularly in credit.\nWe generate interest income primarily from the investment of our daily cash balances, interest earned on securities owned and reverse repurchase agreements. These investments and transactions are generally short-term in nature. We also earn interest income from employee loans, and we earn dividend income on certain marketable securities.\nOccupancy and equipment expense increased by $6.7 million, or 4.7%, to $149.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily driven by increases in software, occupancy, and maintenance contracts.\nSince 2016, the Company has completed acquisitions whose purchase price included an aggregate of approximately 2.2 million shares of the Company's Class A common stock (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $9.2 million), 0.1 million LPUs (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $0.2 million), 0.2 million RSUs (with an acquisition date fair value of approximately $1.2 million) and $34.3 million in cash that may be issued contingent on certain targets being met through 2022.\nOther Income (Losses), Net\nAs of December 31, 2019, our liquidity, which we define as Cash and cash equivalents, Reverse repurchase agreements, Marketable securities and Securities owned, less Securities loaned and Repurchase agreements, was $473.2 million. We expect to use our financial resources to repay debt, profitably hire, make accretive acquisitions, pay dividends, and/or repurchase shares and units of BGC, all while maintaining or improving our investment-grade rating.\nSelling and Promotion\nFees from related parties increased by $5.4 million, or 22.3% to $29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nGains (Losses) on Equity Method Investments\nLimited Partnership Units: LPUs in BGC Holdings and Newmark Holdings are generally held by employees. Generally, such units receive quarterly allocations of net income, which are cash distributed on a quarterly basis and generally contingent upon services being provided by the unit holders. In addition, Preferred Units are granted in connection with the grant of certain LPUs, such as PSUs, that may be granted exchangeability or redeemed in connection with the grant of shares of common stock to cover the withholding taxes owed by the unit holder upon such exchange or grant. This is an acceptable alternative to the common practice among public companies of issuing the gross amount of shares to employees, subject to cashless withholding of shares to pay applicable withholding taxes. Our Preferred Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions other than with respect to a distribution at a rate of either 0.6875% (which is 2.75% per calendar year) or such other amount as set forth in the award documentation. The quarterly allocations of net income to such LPUs are reflected as a component of compensation expense under Equity-based compensation and allocations of net income to limited partnership units and FPUs\u201d in our consolidated statements of operations.\nNet income (loss) from continuing operations attributable to noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries decreased by $0.8 million, or 2.5%, to $29.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCommunications\nFINANCIAL OVERVIEW\nOn February 28, 2017, we completed the acquisition of Besso, an independent Lloyd's of London insurance broker with a strong reputation across property, casualty, marine, aviation, professional and financial risks and reinsurance.\nFees from Related Parties\nOur credit revenues increased by $7.6 million, or 2.7%, to $292.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was mainly due to higher global volumes and an uptick in Fully Electronic credit brokerage.\nRevenues\nSee Note 1- Organization and Basis of Presentation\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding recent accounting pronouncements.\nThe Compensation Committee may grant stock options, stock appreciation rights, deferred stock such as RSUs, bonus stock, performance awards, dividend equivalents and other equity-based awards, including to provide exchange rights for shares of BGC Class A common stock upon exchange of LPUs. On June 22, 2016, at our Annual Meeting of Stockholders, our stockholders approved our Equity Plan to increase from 350 million to 400 million the aggregate number of shares of BGC Class A common stock that may be delivered or cash-settled pursuant to awards granted during the life of the Equity Plan. As of December 31, 2019, the limit on the aggregate number of shares authorized to be delivered allowed for the grant of future awards relating to 137.7 million shares of BGC Class A common stock.\nSee Regulation\u201d included in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to our regulatory environment.\nData, Software and Post-Trade\nAcquisitions and financial reporting obligations related thereto may impact our ability to access longer-term capital markets funding on a timely basis and may necessitate greater short-term borrowings in the interim. This may impact our credit rating or the interest rates on our debt. We may need to access short-term capital sources to meet business needs from time to time, including, but not limited to, conducting operations; hiring or retaining brokers, salespeople, managers and other front-office personnel; financing acquisitions; and providing liquidity, including in situations where we may not be able to access the capital markets in a timely manner when desired by us. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain additional financing when needed on terms that are acceptable to us, if at all.\n During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased 0.2 million shares of BGC Class A common stock at an aggregate price of $1.2 million for a weighted-average price of $5.30 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company repurchased approximately 0.8 million shares of BGC Class A common stock at an aggregate price of approximately $10.4 million for a weighted-average price of $13.23 per share. \nThe measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is based on provisions of enacted tax laws and involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. Because our interpretation of complex tax law may impact the measurement of current and deferred income taxes, actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions regarding the application of tax law.\nGain (Loss) on Divestiture and Sale of Investments\nUnit Redemptions and Share Repurchase Program\nOn July 24, 2018, we issued an aggregate of $450.0 million principal amount of 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023. The 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 are general senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 bear interest at a rate of 5.375% per year, payable in cash on January 24 and July 24 of each year, commencing January 24, 2019. The 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 will mature on July 24, 2023. We may redeem some or all of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 at any time or from time to time for cash at certain make-whole\u201d redemption prices (as set forth in the indenture related to the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023). If a Change of Control Triggering Event\u201d (as defined in the indenture related to the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023) occurs, holders may require the Company to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a price equal to 101% of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the purchase date. The initial carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 was $444.2 million, net of the discount and debt issuance costs of $5.8 million, of which $0.3 million were underwriting fees paid to CF&Co and $41 thousand were underwriting fees paid to CastleOak Securities, L.P. We also paid CF&Co an advisory fee of $0.2 million in connection with the issuance. The issuance costs are amortized as interest expense and the carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 will accrete up to the face amount over the term of the notes. The carrying value of the 5.375% Senior Notes as of December 31, 2019 was $445.2 million.\nNet Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest in Subsidiaries\nRestricted Stock Units: We account for equity-based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of the U.S. GAAP guidance. RSUs provided to certain employees are accounted for as equity awards, and in accordance with the U.S. GAAP, we are required to record an expense for the portion of the RSUs that is ultimately expected to vest. Further, forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Because assumptions are used in estimating employee turnover and associated forfeiture rates, actual results may differ from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAs part of the GFI acquisition, we assumed $240.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.375% Senior Notes. Interest on these notes was payable, semi-annually in arrears on the 19th of January and July. On July 19, 2018, the Company repaid the $240.0 million principal amount of its 8.375% Senior Notes upon their maturity.\nWe provide brokerage services for most widely traded energy and commodities products, including futures and OTC products covering, refined and crude oil, liquid natural gas, coal, electricity, gold and other precious metals, base metals, emissions, and soft commodities. We also provide brokerage services associated with the shipping of certain energy and commodities products.\nWe have various other operating expenses. We incur leasing, equipment and maintenance expenses for our businesses worldwide. We also incur selling and promotion expenses, which include entertainment, marketing and travel-related expenses. We incur communication expenses for voice and data connections with our clients, clearing agents and general usage; professional and consulting fees for legal, audit and other special projects; and interest expense related to short-term operational funding needs, and notes payable and collateralized borrowings.\nEquities, Insurance, and Other Asset Classes\nNotes Payable, Other and Short-term Borrowings\nREGULATORY REQUIREMENTS\nThe Company was authorized to enter into loans, investments or other credit support arrangements for Aqua; such arrangements are proportionally and on the same terms as similar arrangements between Aqua and Cantor. On February 5, 2020, the Company's Board and Audit Committee increased the authorized amount by an additional $2.0 million. The Company has been further authorized to provide counterparty or similar guarantees on behalf of Aqua from time to time, provided that liability for any such guarantees, as well as similar guarantees provided by Cantor, would be shared proportionally with Cantor (see Note 14- Related Party Transactions,\u201d to our consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information).\nMuch of our global derivatives volumes continue to be executed by non-U.S. based clients outside the U.S. and subject to local prudential regulations. As such, we will continue to operate a number of EU regulated venues in accordance with EU directives and licensed by the FCA and other EU-based national Competent Authorities. These venues are also operated for non-derivative instruments for these clients. MiFID II was published by the European Securities and Markets Authority in September 2015, and implemented in January 2018 and introduced important infrastructural changes.\nInterest expense increased by $17.3 million, or 41.6%, to $59.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by interest expense on the $450.0 million 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023 issued in July 2018, interest expense related to the borrowings on the Revolving Credit Agreement, and interest expense on the $300 million 3.750% Senior Notes issued in September 2019, partially offset by lower interest expense on the $240.0 million 8.375% Senior Notes which were repaid in July 2018.\nOn November 4, 2015, partners of BGC Holdings created five new classes of non-distributing partnership units (collectively with the NPSUs, N Units\u201d). These new N Units carry the same name as the underlying unit with the insertion of an additional N\u201d to designate them as the N Unit type and are designated as NREUs, NPREUs, NLPUs, NPLPUs and NPPSUs. The N Units are not entitled to participate in partnership distributions, will not be allocated any items of profit or loss and may not be made exchangeable into shares of BGC Class A common stock. The Eleventh Amendment was approved by the Audit Committee and by the Board.\nFinancial Services Industry\nIn the fourth quarter of 2017, Capitalab completed its largest G-4 Interest Rates IMO to date with more than 15 participating counterparties. The service enabled these counterparties to multilaterally shrink delta, vega and curvature bilateral counterparty risks and significantly reduce both non-cleared and cleared initial margin at the Central Clearing Counterparty. In January of 2018, Capitalab executed the first combined compression cycle in Swaptions, Caps, Floors and cleared interest rate swaps due to its appointment as an Approved Compression Service Provider at LCH's SwapClear. In the second quarter of 2019, Capitalab launched its Nikkei 225 options compression service in partnership with the Singapore Exchange.\nAs a result of the sale of eSpeed, we only sold our on-the-run benchmark 2-, 3-, 5-, 7-, 10-, and 30-year Fully Electronic trading platform for U.S. Treasury Notes and Bonds. We continue to offer Voice brokerage for on-the-run U.S. Treasuries, as well as across various other products in rates, credit, FX, market data and software solutions. As we continue to focus our efforts on converting Voice and Hybrid desks to Fully Electronic execution, our e-businesses and revenues from inter-company data, software, and post-trade services, have continued to grow their revenues.\nOur funding base consists of longer-term capital (equity and notes payable), collateralized financings, shorter-term liabilities and accruals that are a natural outgrowth of specific assets and/or our business model, such as matched fails and accrued compensation. We have limited need for short-term unsecured funding in our regulated entities for their brokerage businesses. Contingent liquidity needs are largely limited to potential cash collateral that may be needed to meet clearing bank, clearinghouse, and exchange margins and/or to fund fails. Capital expenditures tend to be cash neutral and approximately in line with depreciation. Current cash balances exceed our potential normal course contingent liquidity needs. We believe that cash in and available to our largest regulated entities, inclusive of financing provided by clearing banks and cash segregated under regulatory requirements, is adequate for potential cash demands of normal operations, such as margin or fail financing. We expect our operating activities going forward to generate adequate cash flows to fund normal operations, including any dividends paid pursuant to our dividend policy. However, we continually evaluate opportunities for us to maximize our growth and further enhance our strategic position, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic alliances and joint ventures potentially involving all types and combinations of equity, debt and acquisition alternatives. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds to:\nThe fully diluted period-end spot share count was as follows (in thousands):\nOn September 8, 2017, we entered into a committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The revolving credit agreement provided for revolving loans of up to $400.0 million. The maturity date of the facility was September 8, 2019. On November 22, 2017, the Company and Newmark entered into an amendment to the unsecured senior revolving credit agreement. Pursuant to the amendment, the then-outstanding borrowings of the Company under the revolving credit facility were converted into the Converted Term Loan. There was no change in the maturity date or interest rate. Effective December 13, 2017, Newmark assumed the obligations of the Company as borrower under the Converted Term Loan. We remained a borrower under, and retained access to, the revolving credit facility for any future draws, subject to availability which increased as Newmark repaid the Converted Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Newmark repaid the outstanding balance of the Converted Term Loan. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we borrowed $195.0 million under the committed unsecured senior revolving credit agreement and repaid the $195.0 million during the year. Therefore, there were no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n Interest on long-term debt and collateralized borrowings also includes interest on the undrawn portion of the committed unsecured senior Revolving Credit Agreement which was calculated through the maturity date of the facility, which is February 26, 2021. As of December 31, 2019, the undrawn portion of the committed unsecured Revolving Credit Agreement was $280.0 million. \nOverall Market Volumes and Volatility\nCommunications expense increased by $2.0 million, or 1.7%, to $120.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. As a percentage of total revenues, communications expense slightly decreased from the prior year period.\nCompensation and Employee Benefits\nOn November 23, 2018, pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, BGC issued 10,323,366 shares of BGC Class B common stock to Cantor and 712,907 shares of BGC Class B common stock to CFGM, an affiliate of Cantor, in each case in exchange for shares of BGC Class A common stock from Cantor and CFGM, respectively, on a one-to-one basis pursuant to Cantor's and CFGM's right to exchange such shares under the Exchange Agreement. Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, no additional consideration was paid to BGC by Cantor or CFGM for the Class B Issuance. The Class B Issuance was exempt from registration pursuant to Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act.\nOur brokerage revenues from equities, insurance, and other asset classes increased by $29.7 million, or 9.0%, to $358.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily driven by improved global volumes, and revenues generated by Besso, which was acquired on February 28, 2017.\nThis uncertainty could adversely impact investor confidence which could result in additional market volatility. Historically, elevated volatility has often led to increased volumes in the Financial Services markets in which we broker, which could be beneficial for our businesses. At other times, increased volatility has led to many market participants curtailing trading activity. Furthermore, any future trade deal might lead to a fragmented regulatory environment, which could increase the costs of our operations and loss of existing levels of cross-border market access. While we have implemented plans to ensure continuity of service in Europe and continue to have regulated entities and offices in place in many of the major European markets in order to mitigate certain risks and uncertainties created by political negotiations between the U.K. and EU, these and other risks and uncertainties could have a material adverse effect on our customers, counterparties, businesses, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nGoing forward, we expect these businesses to become an even more valuable part of BGC as they continue to grow.\nOn July 31, 2018, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which, upon being declared effective by the SEC, the holders of the 5.375% Senior Notes due 2023, issued in a private placement on July 24, 2018, exchanged such notes for new registered notes with substantially identical terms.\nA valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if it is deemed more likely than not that those assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies.\nCONTINGENT PAYMENTS RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS\nOn December 14, 2016, partners of BGC Holdings amended certain terms and conditions of the partnership's N Units in order to provide flexibility to the Company and the Partnership in using such N Units in connection with compensation arrangements and practices. The amendment provides for a minimum $5 million gross revenue requirement in a given quarter as a condition for an N Unit to be replaced by another type of partnership unit in accordance with the Partnership Agreement and the grant documentation. The amendment was approved by the Audit Committee.\nCollateralized Borrowings", "item_7_tables": "Table 264: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>
