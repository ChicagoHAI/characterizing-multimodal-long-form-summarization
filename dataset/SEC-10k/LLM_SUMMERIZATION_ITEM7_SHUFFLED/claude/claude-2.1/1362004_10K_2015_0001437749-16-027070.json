MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those anticipated include those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nWe provide professional services and technology-based solutions to government and commercial clients, including management, technology, and policy consulting and implementation services. We help our clients conceive, develop, implement, and improve solutions that address complex natural resource, social, and public safety issues. Our services primarily address four key markets: energy, environment, and infrastructure; health, education and social programs; safety and security; and consumer and financial. We provide services across these four markets that deliver value throughout the entire life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative, from research and analysis and assessment and advice to design and implementation of programs and technology-based solutions, and the provision of engagement services and programs.\nIn prior years we have had three markets; however, due to the acquisition of Olson near the end of fiscal year 2014, we made certain changes to better reflect our current business starting in the first quarter of 2015. First, we began to break out our revenues into four markets instead of three by adding a new market related to our consumer and financial client revenue, which was previously included in the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market. Second, we changed the name of the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market to health, education and social programs. Finally, we changed the name of our public safety and defense market and renamed it safety and security to more accurately reflect the nature of our client base. The criteria for determining the clients, and related revenue, presented in each of the classifications remains the same.\nOur clients utilize our services because we combine diverse institutional knowledge and experience in their activities with the deep subject-matter expertise of our highly educated staff, which we deploy in multi-disciplinary teams. We categorize our clients into two classifications; government and commercial. Within the government classification, we present three client sub-classifications: federal government, state and local government, and international government.\nOur major clients are federal government departments and agencies. Our federal government clients have included every cabinet-level department, most significantly HHS, DOS, and DoD. Federal government clients generated approximately 48%, 51%, and 58% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. State and local government clients generated approximately 10%, 10%, and 9% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. International government clients generated approximately 7%, 9%, and 5% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nWe also serve a variety of commercial clients worldwide, including airlines, airports, electric and gas utilities, oil companies, hospitals, health insurers, and other health-related companies, banks and other financial services companies, transportation, travel and hospitality firms, non-profits/associations, law firms, manufacturing firms, retail chains, and distribution companies. Our commercial clients, which include clients outside the U.S., generated approximately 35%, 30%, and 28% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We have successfully worked with many of our clients for decades, with the result that we have a unique and knowledgeable perspective on their needs.\nWe report operating results and financial data as a single segment based on the consolidated information used by our chief operating decision-maker in evaluating the financial performance of our business and allocating resources. Our single segment represents our core business-professional services for government and commercial clients.\nAlthough we describe our multiple service offerings to four markets to provide a better understanding of our business, we do not manage our business or allocate our resources based on those service offerings or markets.\nIn 2015, we saw growth in commercial client revenue, federal government revenue, and state and local government revenue, which was partially offset by lower international government revenue, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue increased to $1,132.2 million, representing growth of approximately 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. Operating income increased 8.5% to $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year; however, net income declined 1.7% to $39.4 million, largely driven by higher interest expense due to borrowings to fund the Olson acquisition, as well as an increase in amortization for intangible assets resulting from the Olson acquisition.\nOur 2014 acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech have contributed to the continued diversification of our revenue sources, consistent with our growth strategy. The acquisition of Olson, a leading provider of marketing technology and digital services, was significant and was completed on November 5, 2014. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $298.2 million in cash was funded by our Fourth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d). Due to the increased level of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility, applicable interest rates, as determined by the pricing matrices governing the Credit Facility, increased approximately one percentage point following the acquisition. We anticipate that interest expense will decrease over the next 12 months based on our expectation of a reduction in the average balance of debt outstanding. In 2015, amortization of intangibles increased $6.7 million, largely due to the acquisition of Olson; however we expect this amortization to decrease over the next 12 months as some of these intangibles assets become fully amortized. As a result of the acquisitions of Olson and CityTech and future growth expectations for our commercial business, we anticipate our concentration of revenue to commercial clients and revenue within the consumer and financial market will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\nWe believe that demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues in our key markets due to heightened concerns about clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; and ongoing homeland security threats. We also see significant opportunity to leverage further our digital and client engagement capabilities across our commercial and government client base. Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to enhance our client relationships and seek larger engagements across the program life cycle in our four key markets, and to complete and successfully integrate additional strategic acquisitions. In our four markets, we will continue to focus on building scale in vertical and horizontal domain expertise; developing business with both our government and commercial clients; and replicating our business model in selective geographies. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies.\nFederal government revenue was 48% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. While we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain near-term challenges facing all government service providers, including top-line legislative constraints on federal government discretionary spending that limit expenditure growth through 2021. Actions by Congress could result in a delay or reduction to our revenue, profit, and cash flow and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations; however, we believe we are well positioned in markets that have been, and will continue to be, priorities to the federal government.\nWe believe that the combination of internally-generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, potential acquisitions, customary capital expenditures, and other current working capital requirements.\nOur results of operations and cash flow may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> progress of contract performance;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> extraordinary economic events and natural disasters;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> number of billable days in a quarter;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing of client orders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing of award fee notices;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in the scope of contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> variations in purchasing patterns under our contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> federal and state and local governments' and other clients' spending levels;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing of billings to, and payments by, clients;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing of receipt of invoices from, and payments to, employees and vendors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> commencement, completion, and termination of contracts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> strategic decisions we make, such as acquisitions, consolidations, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, and changes in business strategy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing of significant costs and investments (such as bid and proposal costs and the costs involved in planning or making acquisitions);\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> timing of events related to discrete tax items;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> our contract mix and use of subcontractors;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> additions to, and departures of, staff;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in staff utilization;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> paid time off taken by our employees;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> level and cost of our debt;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> changes in accounting principles and policies; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> general market and economic conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel, facilities, and related costs, are fixed in the short term, contract performance and variation in the volume of activity, as well as in the number and volume of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter, may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.\nWe generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years, although we cannot ensure that we will be able to do so in the future.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. If any of these estimates or judgments prove to be incorrect, our reported results could be materially affected. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting practices described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and therefore consider them to be critical accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies listed below, are more fully described and discussed in Note B-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We enter into three types of contracts: time-and-materials, cost-based and fixed-price.\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Time-and-Materials Contracts. Revenue for time-and-materials contracts is recorded on the basis of allowable labor hours worked multiplied by the contract-defined billing rates, plus the costs of other items used in the performance of the contract. Profits and losses on time-and-materials contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract-defined billing rates for these services.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Cost-Based Contracts. Revenue under cost-based contracts is recognized as costs are incurred. Applicable estimated profit, if any, is included in earnings in the proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. Incentives, award fees, or penalties related to performance are also considered in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards, taking into consideration factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Fixed-Price Contracts. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized when earned, generally as work is performed. Services performed vary from contract to contract and are not always uniformly performed over the term of the arrangement. Fixed-price contracts may contain multiple elements that must be evaluated to determine if they represent separate units of accounting that have stand-alone value. If the assessment is made that there is more than one unit of accounting, the contract value is then allocated to each unit based upon management's best estimate of selling price and the appropriate revenue recognition method is applied to each unit. We recognize revenue in a number of different ways on fixed-price contracts based upon the nature of the services to be provided and an assessment of what best mirrors the pattern of performance for the deliverable/contract, including:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Proportional Performance: Revenue on certain fixed-price contracts is recognized based on proportional performance when the provision of services extends beyond an accounting period with more than one discrete performance act, and progress towards completion can be measured based on a reliable output or input. Under this method, revenue is recorded each period based upon certain contract performance input measures incurred (labor hours, labor costs, or total costs) or output measures completed, expressed as a proportion of a total project estimate. Progress on a contract is monitored regularly to ensure that revenue recognized reflects project status. When hours or costs incurred are used as the basis for revenue recognition, the hours or costs incurred represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures of contract performance, including the presentation of deliverables to the client. Clients are obligated to pay as services are performed, and in the event that a client cancels the contract, payment for services performed through the date of cancellation is typically negotiated with the client. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Specific Performance: When the services to be performed consist of a single act, revenue is recognized at the time the act is performed or at the completion of the single service. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Straight-Line: When services are performed or are expected to be performed consistently throughout an arrangement, or when we are compensated on a retainer or fixed-fee basis, revenue is recognized ratably over the period benefited.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Completed Contract: Revenue and costs on certain fixed-price contracts are recognized at completion if the final act is so significant to the arrangement that value is deemed to be transferred only at completion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue recognition requires us to use judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and costs or other variables, and making assumptions for scheduling and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of revenue and estimates at completion can be complicated and are subject to many variables. Contract costs include labor, subcontractor costs, and other direct costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. At times, we must also make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages, prices for subcontractors, and other direct costs. From time to time, facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs or hours and thus the associated revenue on a contract. To the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized, we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known. A provision for the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result, operating results could be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\nOur contractual arrangements are evaluated to assess whether revenue should be recognized on a gross versus net basis. Management's assessment when determining gross versus net revenue recognition is based on several factors such as whether we serve as the primary service provider, have autonomy in selecting subcontractors, or have credit risk, all of which are primary indicators that we serve as the principal to the transaction. In such cases, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. When such indicators are not present and we are primarily functioning as an agent under an arrangement, revenue is recognized on a net basis.\nWe generate invoices to clients in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract, which may not be directly related to the performance of services. Unbilled receivables are invoiced based upon the achievement of specific events as defined by each contract, including deliverables, timetables, and incurrence of certain costs. Unbilled receivables are classified as a current asset. Advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenue with corresponding costs incurred by us included in the cost of revenue. We record revenue net of taxes collected from customers to be remitted to governmental authorities.\nWe may proceed with work based upon client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents. We have a review process for approving any such work. Revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. We base our estimates on a variety of factors, including previous experiences with the client, communications with the client regarding funding status, and our knowledge of available funding for the contract.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over such lives and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise. As of December 31, 2015, goodwill and intangibles assets were $687.4 million and $58.9 million, respectively.\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of September 30 of each year. For the purposes of performing this review, we have concluded that we have one reporting unit. For the annual impairment review as of September 30, 2015, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that our reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, we may conclude that no impairment exists. If we conclude otherwise, a two-step goodwill impairment test must be performed, which includes a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value.\nOur qualitative analysis as of September 30, 2015 included macroeconomic and industry and market-specific considerations, financial performance indicators and measurements, and other factors. Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, and thus the two-step impairment test was not required to be performed for 2015. Therefore, based upon management's review, no goodwill impairment charge was required as of September 30, 2015. Historically, we have recorded no goodwill impairment charges.\nWe are required to review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.\nStock-based Compensation\nOn June 5, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the ICF International, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, the Omnibus Plan\u201d). The Amendment, among other items, increased the new shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan to 5,090,000. The Omnibus Plan provides for the granting of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards to all officers, key employees, and non-employee directors.\nWe utilize cash-settled RSUs ( CSRSUs\u201d), which are settled only in cash payments. The cash payment is based on the fair value of our stock price at the vesting date, calculated by multiplying the number of CSRSUs vested by our closing stock price on the vesting date, subject to a maximum payment cap and a minimum payment floor. We also grant awards of unregistered shares to our non-employee directors under our Annual Equity Election program. The awards are issued from our treasury stock and have no impact on the shares available for grant under the Omnibus Plan.\nWe recognized total compensation expense relating to stock-based compensation of $14.7 million, $13.4 million, and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs and CSRSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize expense for performance-based share awards ( PSAs\u201d), which are subject to a performance condition and a market condition, on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Non-employee director awards do not include vesting conditions and therefore are expensed when issued.\nCompensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of these instruments and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. The calculation of the fair value of our awards requires certain inputs that are subjective and changes to the estimates used will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense to vary. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, PSAs and non-employee director awards is estimated based on the fair value of a share of common stock at the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of a stock option award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant, as well as other assumptions used as inputs in the valuation model including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards, the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options and the risk-free interest rate assumption. The fair value of PSAs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We treat CSRSUs as liability-classified awards, and therefore account for them at fair value estimated based on the closing price of our stock at the reporting date.\nWe are required to adjust stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based on factors such as historical experience and employee class, actual forfeitures may differ from our current estimates. In addition, the estimation of PSAs that will ultimately vest requires judgment based on performance conditions. To the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. See Note K-Accounting for Stock-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nNew accounting standards are discussed in Note B-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nSELECTED KEY METRICS\nThe following table shows our revenue from each of our four key markets as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. For each client, we have attributed all revenue from that client to the market we consider to be the client's primary market, even if a portion of that revenue relates to a different market.\nIn prior years we have had three markets; however, due to the acquisition of Olson near the end of fiscal year 2014, we made certain changes to better reflect our current business starting in the first quarter of 2015. First, we began to break out our revenues into four markets instead of three by adding a new market related to our consumer and financial client revenue, which was previously included in the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market. Second, we changed the name of the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market to health, education and social programs. Finally, we changed the name of our public safety and defense market and renamed it safety and security to more accurately reflect the nature of our client base. The criteria for determining the clients, and related revenue, presented in each of the classifications remains the same. In addition, certain revenue amounts in the prior year have been reclassified due to minor adjustments.\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy, environment, and infrastructure\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Health, education, and social programs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Safety and security\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consumer and financial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by the acquisition of Olson. The fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech.\nOur primary clients are the agencies and departments of the federal government and commercial clients. Most of our revenue is from contracts on which we are the prime contractor, which we believe provides us strong client relationships. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 85%, 86%, and 86% of our revenue, respectively, was from prime contracts. The following table shows our revenue by type of client as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. Certain immaterial revenue amounts in the prior year have been reclassified due to minor adjustments.\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. federal government\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. state and local government\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International government\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Government\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by the acquisition of Olson.

Unless the context requires otherwise, we use the term contracts\u201d to refer to contracts and any task orders or delivery orders issued under a contract. We have three main types of contracts, time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, and cost-based contracts, described further below.\nTime-and-materials contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials, other direct costs, and out-of-pocket expenses. Our actual labor costs may vary from the expected costs that formed the basis for our negotiated hourly rates if we utilize different employees than anticipated, need to hire additional employees at higher wages, increase the compensation paid to existing employees, or are able to hire employees at lower-than-expected rates. Our non-labor costs, such as fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative costs, also may be higher or lower than we anticipated. To the extent that our actual labor and non-labor costs under a time-and-materials contract vary significantly from our expected costs or the negotiated hourly rates, we can generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit or, perhaps, incur a loss.\nFixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks for a pre-determined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-based contracts, fixed-price contracts involve greater financial risk because we bear the full impact of labor and non-labor costs that exceed our estimates, in terms of costs per hour, number of hours, and all other costs of performance in return for the full benefit of any cost savings. We therefore may generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit or, perhaps, incur a loss.\nCost-based contracts. Under cost-based contracts, (which include cost-based fixed fee, cost-based award fee, and cost-based incentive fee contracts, as well as grants and cooperative agreements), we are paid based on the allowable costs we incur, and usually receive a fee. All of our cost-based contracts reimburse us for our direct labor and fringe-benefit costs that are allowable under the contract; however, certain contracts limit the amount of overhead and general and administrative costs we can recover, which may be less than our actual overhead and general and administrative costs. In addition, our fees are constrained by fee ceilings and, in certain cases, such as with grants and cooperative agreements, we may receive no fee. Because of these limitations, our cost-based contracts, on average, are our least profitable type of contract, and we may generate less than the expected profit, or perhaps, incur a loss. Cost-based fixed-fee contracts specify the fee to be paid. Cost-based incentive-fee and cost-based award-fee contracts provide for increases or decreases in the contract fee, within specified limits, based upon actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, quality, schedule, and performance.\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage of our revenue for each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated.\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time-and-materials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed-price\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost-based\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in fixed-price contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue and the decrease in time-and-materials contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the increase in fixed-price contracts from the acquisition of Olson. The increase in fixed-price contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue and the decrease in time-and-materials contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, is primarily due to the increase in fixed-price contracts from the acquisition of Olson and Mostra.\nACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nA key element of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. In 2014, we added Mostra, CityTech and Olson; and in 2013, we added ECA.\nOlson. On November 5, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Olson, a leading provider of marketing technology and digital services based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As a result of the acquisition, Olson became our wholly owned subsidiary. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $298.2 million in cash was funded by our Credit Facility. The acquisition expanded our existing digital technology and strategic communications work and strengthened our ability to bring more integrated solutions to an expanded client base, including multi-channel marketing initiatives across web, mobile, email, social, print, broadcast and off-premise platforms.\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. The allocation of the total purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Olson is based on management's estimate of fair value as of the acquisition date and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and to other acquired intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired was approximately $293.4 million. We allocated approximately $228.5 million to goodwill and $64.9 million to other intangible assets. See Note F-Business Combinations\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a more detailed discussion of this acquisition.\nCityTech. In March 2014, we acquired CityTech, a Chicago-based digital interactive consultancy specializing in enterprise applications development, web experience management, mobile application development, cloud enablement, managed services, and customer experience management solutions. The acquisition adds expertise to our content management capabilities and complements our digital and interactive business.\nMostra. In February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Mostra, a strategic communications consulting company based in Brussels, Belgium. Mostra offers end-to-end, multichannel communications solutions to assist government and commercial clients, in particular the European Commission. The acquisition extends our strategic communications capabilities globally to complement our policy work and enhance our strategy of providing a full suite of services that leverage our research and advisory services.\nECA. In July 2013, we hired the staff of, and purchased certain assets and liabilities from, ECA, an e-commerce technology-based services firm based in New York, New York. The addition of ECA enhanced our multi-channel, end-to-end e-commerce solutions.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of comprehensive

31, 2014\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $1,132.2 million, compared to $1,050.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $82.1 million or 7.8%. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the 25.0% increase in revenue from commercial clients, which was the result of higher revenue from digital services, driven largely by the Olson acquisition. Total government revenue was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Increases in federal government revenue and state and local government revenue of 1.5% and 5.0%, respectively, were mostly offset by lower international government revenue, which was driven by the weakening of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Canadian dollar. As a result of the acquisitions of Olson and CityTech and future growth expectations for our commercial business, we expect that commercial revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\nDirect Costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $694.4 million compared to $654.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $39.5 million or 6.0%. The increase in direct costs was primarily attributable to direct costs resulting from the acquisition of Olson, partially offset by a reduction in our use of subcontracted labor. Direct costs as a percent of revenue decreased to 61.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 62.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We generally expect the ratio of direct costs as a percentage of revenue to decrease when our own labor increases relative to subcontracted labor.\nChanges in the mix of services and other direct costs provided under our contracts can result in variability in our direct costs as a percentage of revenue. For example, when we perform work in the area of implementation, we expect that more of our services will be performed in client-provided facilities and/or with dedicated staff. Such work generally has a higher proportion of direct costs than much of our current research and advisory work, and we anticipate that higher utilization of such staff will decrease indirect expenses. In addition, to the extent we are successful in winning larger contracts, our own labor services component could decrease because larger contracts typically are broader in scope and require more diverse capabilities, potentially resulting in more subcontracted labor, more other direct costs, and lower margins. Although these factors could lead to a higher ratio of direct costs as a percentage of revenue, the economics of these larger jobs are nonetheless generally favorable because they increase income, broaden our revenue base, and have a favorable return on invested capital.\nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $329.2 million compared to $302.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $27.1 million or 9.0%. Indirect and selling expenses include our management, facilities, and infrastructure costs for all employees, as well as salaries and wages, including stock-based compensation provided to employees whose compensation and other benefit costs are included in indirect and selling expenses, plus associated fringe benefits, not directly related to client engagements. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the Olson acquisition. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $2.8 million reduction to indirect and selling expenses related to a fair value adjustment for contingent consideration recorded as a result of the ECA acquisition. Indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of the costs of software we use internally. The increase in depreciation and amortization of 21.3% was primarily due to the acquisition of Olson.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $17.2 million compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $6.7 million increase was primarily due to the addition of $64.9 million of intangible assets as a result of the Olson acquisition, partly offset by reduced amortization related to intangible assets from acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized.\nOperating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating income was $75.2 million compared to $69.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $5.9 million or 8.5%. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 6.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We incurred lower expenses related to acquisitions, severance and international office closures during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, however the positive margin impact of this reduction was mostly offset by the fair value adjustment of $2.8 million related to contingent consideration for the acquisition of ECA that reduced indirect and selling expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense was $10.1 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $5.8 million increase was driven by a higher average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of borrowings to fund the acquisition of Olson, and an increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility due to the increased level of debt outstanding.\nOther expense. Other expense was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other expense for both periods primarily represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of closing certain international offices as part of actions taken to improve our cost structure and operations.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was 38.1% and 37.6%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily related to unfavorable adjustments for compensation costs and other expenses permanently not deductible for tax purposes. Our effective tax rate, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was lower than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to the true-up of our 2014 tax provision, tax benefit of foreign tax rate differential and state tax credits, partially offset by permanent differences related to compensation costs and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes. We account for the expected impact of discrete tax items once we determine that they are both reasonably quantified and when we are confident they will be realized due to the associated event occurring, such as the filing of an amended tax return, enactment of tax legislation, or the closure of an audit examination.\nYear ended December 31, 2014, compared to year ended December 31, 2013\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $1,050.1 million, compared to $949.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing an increase of $100.8 million or 10.6%. The increase in revenue was due to the 7.1% increase in government revenue, as well as the 19.5% increase in revenue from commercial clients. The increase in government revenue was primarily attributable to international government revenue from the acquisition of Mostra, as well as revenue generated from state and local government clients. The increase in revenue from commercial clients was primarily driven by growth in digital interactive program revenues from the Olson and CityTech acquisitions, as well as energy and healthcare related program revenues. The growth in government and commercial revenue was partially offset by a decline in federal government revenue, largely driven by a decline in the public safety and defense market and the impact of severe weather experienced by our operations on the east coast of the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014. We estimated that the impact of the severe weather on first quarter revenues was approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million.\nDirect Costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $654.9 million, compared to $591.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $63.4 million or 10.7%. The increase in direct costs is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Olson, Mostra and CityTech. Direct costs as a percent of revenue of 62.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 were consistent with direct costs as a percent of revenue of 62.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $302.0 million, compared to $272.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $29.6 million or 10.9%. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in non-labor expense, driven by a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of ECA of $2.8 million. Indirect and selling expenses were 28.7% as a percent of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in depreciation and amortization of 19.0% was primarily due to an increase in expenses for assets acquired in the latter part of 2013 related to opening new offices, as well as the acquisition of Olson and Mostra.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $10.4 million compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 10.1% increase was primarily due to amortization resulting from the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions, partly offset by lower amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized.\nOperating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2014, operating income was $69.4 million compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $4.7 million or 7.2%. Operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, operating income included actions taken to improve our cost structure and operations including $1.9 million for severance costs and $1.3 million as a result of closing certain international offices. Operating income also included $2.2 million of acquisition costs, approximately $2.7 million of losses incurred on projects acquired as part of our acquisition of ECA, and approximately $1.6 million to $2.0 million of losses due to severe weather experienced by our operations on the east coast of the U.S. The negative margin impact of these items was partially offset by a change in the fair value of contingent consideration in the amount of $2.8 million related to the acquisition of ECA, and the positive impact on operating income from the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense was $4.3 million, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by a higher average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech, and an increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility due to the increased level of debt outstanding.\nOther expense. Other expense was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the reclassification of $0.5 million of foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of closing one of our international offices.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was 37.6% and 36.8%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily related to non-deductible acquisition costs and other expenses offset by favorable adjustments resulting from the true-up of our 2013 tax provision to our federal and foreign tax return filings, state tax credits, and non-taxable income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit, was lower than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to the true-up of our 2013 tax provision, non-taxable income, foreign and state tax credits partially offset by permanent differences related to acquisition costs and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity and Borrowing Capacity. Short-term liquidity requirements are created by our use of funds for working capital, capital expenditures, and the need to provide any debt service. We expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. We entered into our Credit Facility with a syndication of 11 commercial banks on May 16, 2014, which was further modified on November 5, 2014. The Credit Facility matures on May 16, 2019 and allows for borrowings of up to $500.0 million without a borrowing base requirement, taking into account financial, performance-based limitations, and provides for an accordion,\u201d which permits additional revolving credit commitments of up to $100.0 million, subject to lenders' approval. The Credit Facility provides for stand-by letters of credit aggregating up to $30.0 million that reduce the funds available under the Credit Facility when issued. The Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and requires that we remain in compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants, as defined in the Credit Facility, require, among other things, that we maintain, on a consolidated basis for each quarter, a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our covenants under the Credit Facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $311.5 million borrowed under the Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit of $3.7 million, resulting in unused borrowing capacity of $184.8 million under our Credit Facility (excluding the accordion), which is available for our working capital needs and for other purposes. Taking into account certain financial, performance-based limitations, available borrowing capacity (excluding the accordion) was $131.9 million.\nWe have the ability to borrow funds under our Credit Facility at interest rates based on both LIBOR and prime rates, at our discretion, plus their applicable margins. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.23% and 2.41%, respectively.\nWe anticipate that our long-term liquidity requirements, including any future acquisitions, will be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility, additional secured or unsecured debt, or the issuance of common or preferred stock, each of which may be initially funded through borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nWe believe that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, customary capital expenditures, and other current working capital requirements. We are continuously analyzing our capital structure to ensure we have sufficient capital to fund future acquisitions and internal growth. We monitor the state of the financial markets on a regular basis to assess the availability and cost of additional capital resources both from debt and equity sources. We believe that we will be able to access these markets at commercially reasonable terms and conditions if we need additional borrowings or capital.\nFinancial Condition. There were several changes in our balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash decreased to $7.7 million on December 31, 2015, from $12.1 million on December 31, 2014 and long-term debt decreased to $311.5 million on December 31, 2015, from $350.1 million on December 31, 2014. Contract receivables, net, of $259.8 million on December 31, 2015 was generally consistent with the prior year, while days-sales-outstanding decreased to 73 days on December 31, 2015, as compared to 74 days on December 31, 2014. Accrued salaries and benefits and accounts payable decreased $13.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and days-payables-outstanding decreased from 58 days as of December 31, 2014 to 53 days as of December 31, 2015. Treasury stock increased $24.7 million primarily due to share buybacks under our share repurchase plan. The $5.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss was driven by the devaluation of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Canadian dollar.\nWe have explored various options of mitigating the risk associated with potential fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which we conduct transactions. We currently have hedges in an amount proportionate to work anticipated to be performed under certain contracts in Europe. We recognize changes in the fair-value of the hedges in our results of operations. We may increase the number, size and scope of our hedges as we analyze options for mitigating our foreign exchange risk. The current impact of the hedges to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\nCash Flow. We consider cash on deposit and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the following years.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,500 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(358,506 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,622 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(64,448 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>283,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70,433 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of exchange rate changes on cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,746 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,004 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,375 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,772 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts, our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, and our ability to manage our vendor payments. We bill most of our clients monthly after services are rendered. Operating activities provided cash in each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013 of $76.3 million, $79.2 million, and $80.8 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities for 2015 were positively impacted by net income and income tax receivable and payable, partially offset by accrued salaries and benefits and accrued expenses. Cash flows from operating activities for 2014 were positively impacted by net income, accounts payable and accrued salaries and benefits, partially offset by income tax receivable and payable, contract receivables and deferred revenue. Cash flows from operating activities for 2013 were positively impacted by net income, income tax receivable and payable and accrued salaries and benefits, partially offset by prepaid and other assets.\nOur cash flow used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions. During the year ended 2015, we purchased capital assets totaling $12.7 million and paid approximately $1.8 million related to a holdback adjustment for our 2014 acquisition of Olson. During the year ended 2014, we paid approximately $347.9 million for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and purchased capital assets totaling $10.6 million. During the year ended 2013, we paid approximately $4.8 million for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and purchased capital assets totaling $11.9 million.\nOur cash flow used in and provided by financing activities consists primarily of debt and equity transactions. For the year ended 2015, cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to net payments on our Credit Facility of $38.5 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $22.3 million. For the year ended 2014, cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily due to net advances on our Credit Facility of $310.1 million, primarily as a result of our acquisitions, partially offset by share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $24.4 million. For the year ended 2013, cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to a net pay down on the Credit Facility of $65.0 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $5.4 million.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nContractual Obligations\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements to finance the lease of facilities. We have financed the use of all of our office and storage facilities through operating leases. Operating leases are also used from time to time to finance the use of computers, servers, copiers, telephone systems, and to a lesser extent, other fixed assets, such as furnishings, and we also obtain operating leases in connection with business acquisitions. We generally assume the lease rights and obligations of businesses acquired in business combinations and continue financing facilities and equipment under operating leases until the end of the lease term following the acquisition date.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 10 outstanding letters of credit provided for under our Credit Facility with a total value of $3.7 million primarily related to deposits to support our facility leases.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 that require us to make future cash payments. Our summary of contractual obligations includes payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 to 3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 to 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligation (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent of facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditure obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>376,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the obligation for principal and variable interest payments related to the Credit Facility assuming the principal amount outstanding and interest rates at December 31, 2015 remain fixed through maturity.

Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $10.4 million compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Revenue increased to $1,132.2 million, representing growth of approximately 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. Operating income increased 8.5% to $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year; however, net income declined 1.7% to $39.4 million, largely driven by higher interest expense due to borrowings to fund the Olson acquisition, as well as an increase in amortization for intangible assets resulting from the Olson acquisition.\nOur operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts, our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, and our ability to manage our vendor payments. We bill most of our clients monthly after services are rendered. Operating activities provided cash in each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013 of $76.3 million, $79.2 million, and $80.8 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities for 2015 were positively impacted by net income and income tax receivable and payable, partially offset by accrued salaries and benefits and accrued expenses. Cash flows from operating activities for 2014 were positively impacted by net income, accounts payable and accrued salaries and benefits, partially offset by income tax receivable and payable, contract receivables and deferred revenue. Cash flows from operating activities for 2013 were positively impacted by net income, income tax receivable and payable and accrued salaries and benefits, partially offset by prepaid and other assets.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 to 3\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 to 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than\n5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligation (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>314,358 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent of facilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>252,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62,540 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,629 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>874 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditure obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>601,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>376,949 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,083 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $17.2 million compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $6.7 million increase was primarily due to the addition of $64.9 million of intangible assets as a result of the Olson acquisition, partly offset by reduced amortization related to intangible assets from acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized.\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the period-over-period rate of change in each of them and expresses these items as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nIn prior years we have had three markets; however, due to the acquisition of Olson near the end of fiscal year 2014, we made certain changes to better reflect our current business starting in the first quarter of 2015. First, we began to break out our revenues into four markets instead of three by adding a new market related to our consumer and financial client revenue, which was previously included in the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market. Second, we changed the name of the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market to health, education and social programs. Finally, we changed the name of our public safety and defense market and renamed it safety and security to more accurately reflect the nature of our client base. The criteria for determining the clients, and related revenue, presented in each of the classifications remains the same. In addition, certain revenue amounts in the prior year have been reclassified due to minor adjustments.\nWe may proceed with work based upon client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents. We have a review process for approving any such work. Revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. We base our estimates on a variety of factors, including previous experiences with the client, communications with the client regarding funding status, and our knowledge of available funding for the contract.\nACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWe recognized total compensation expense relating to stock-based compensation of $14.7 million, $13.4 million, and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs and CSRSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize expense for performance-based share awards ( PSAs\u201d), which are subject to a performance condition and a market condition, on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Non-employee director awards do not include vesting conditions and therefore are expensed when issued.\nOur major clients are federal government departments and agencies. Our federal government clients have included every cabinet-level department, most significantly HHS, DOS, and DoD. Federal government clients generated approximately 48%, 51%, and 58% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. State and local government clients generated approximately 10%, 10%, and 9% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. International government clients generated approximately 7%, 9%, and 5% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nCompensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of these instruments and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. The calculation of the fair value of our awards requires certain inputs that are subjective and changes to the estimates used will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense to vary. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, PSAs and non-employee director awards is estimated based on the fair value of a share of common stock at the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of a stock option award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant, as well as other assumptions used as inputs in the valuation model including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards, the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options and the risk-free interest rate assumption. The fair value of PSAs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We treat CSRSUs as liability-classified awards, and therefore account for them at fair value estimated based on the closing price of our stock at the reporting date.\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. The allocation of the total purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Olson is based on management's estimate of fair value as of the acquisition date and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and to other acquired intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired was approximately $293.4 million. We allocated approximately $228.5 million to goodwill and $64.9 million to other intangible assets. See Note F-Business Combinations\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a more detailed discussion of this acquisition.\nChanges in the mix of services and other direct costs provided under our contracts can result in variability in our direct costs as a percentage of revenue. For example, when we perform work in the area of implementation, we expect that more of our services will be performed in client-provided facilities and/or with dedicated staff. Such work generally has a higher proportion of direct costs than much of our current research and advisory work, and we anticipate that higher utilization of such staff will decrease indirect expenses. In addition, to the extent we are successful in winning larger contracts, our own labor services component could decrease because larger contracts typically are broader in scope and require more diverse capabilities, potentially resulting in more subcontracted labor, more other direct costs, and lower margins. Although these factors could lead to a higher ratio of direct costs as a percentage of revenue, the economics of these larger jobs are nonetheless generally favorable because they increase income, broaden our revenue base, and have a favorable return on invested capital.\n \u2022 timing of significant costs and investments (such as bid and proposal costs and the costs involved in planning or making acquisitions); \nOur primary clients are the agencies and departments of the federal government and commercial clients. Most of our revenue is from contracts on which we are the prime contractor, which we believe provides us strong client relationships. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 85%, 86%, and 86% of our revenue, respectively, was from prime contracts. The following table shows our revenue by type of client as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. Certain immaterial revenue amounts in the prior year have been reclassified due to minor adjustments.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n(1) Represents the obligation for principal and variable interest payments related to the Credit Facility assuming the principal amount outstanding and interest rates at December 31, 2015 remain fixed through maturity. These assumptions are subject to change in future periods.\nWe believe that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, customary capital expenditures, and other current working capital requirements. We are continuously analyzing our capital structure to ensure we have sufficient capital to fund future acquisitions and internal growth. We monitor the state of the financial markets on a regular basis to assess the availability and cost of additional capital resources both from debt and equity sources. We believe that we will be able to access these markets at commercially reasonable terms and conditions if we need additional borrowings or capital.\n \u2022 Cost-Based Contracts. Revenue under cost-based contracts is recognized as costs are incurred. Applicable estimated profit, if any, is included in earnings in the proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. Incentives, award fees, or penalties related to performance are also considered in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards, taking into consideration factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $302.0 million, compared to $272.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $29.6 million or 10.9%. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in non-labor expense, driven by a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of ECA of $2.8 million. Indirect and selling expenses were 28.7% as a percent of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nWe provide professional services and technology-based solutions to government and commercial clients, including management, technology, and policy consulting and implementation services. We help our clients conceive, develop, implement, and improve solutions that address complex natural resource, social, and public safety issues. Our services primarily address four key markets: energy, environment, and infrastructure; health, education and social programs; safety and security; and consumer and financial. We provide services across these four markets that deliver value throughout the entire life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative, from research and analysis and assessment and advice to design and implementation of programs and technology-based solutions, and the provision of engagement services and programs.\n(dollars in thousands)\n \u2022 paid time off taken by our employees; \nOur qualitative analysis as of September 30, 2015 included macroeconomic and industry and market-specific considerations, financial performance indicators and measurements, and other factors. Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, and thus the two-step impairment test was not required to be performed for 2015. Therefore, based upon management's review, no goodwill impairment charge was required as of September 30, 2015. Historically, we have recorded no goodwill impairment charges.\nThe fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by the acquisition of Olson. The fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech.\nWe also serve a variety of commercial clients worldwide, including airlines, airports, electric and gas utilities, oil companies, hospitals, health insurers, and other health-related companies, banks and other financial services companies, transportation, travel and hospitality firms, non-profits/associations, law firms, manufacturing firms, retail chains, and distribution companies. Our commercial clients, which include clients outside the U.S., generated approximately 35%, 30%, and 28% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We have successfully worked with many of our clients for decades, with the result that we have a unique and knowledgeable perspective on their needs.\n \u2022 strategic decisions we make, such as acquisitions, consolidations, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, and changes in business strategy; \n \u2022 Specific Performance: When the services to be performed consist of a single act, revenue is recognized at the time the act is performed or at the completion of the single service. \nContractual Obligations\nWe believe that demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues in our key markets due to heightened concerns about clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; and ongoing homeland security threats. We also see significant opportunity to leverage further our digital and client engagement capabilities across our commercial and government client base. Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to enhance our client relationships and seek larger engagements across the program life cycle in our four key markets, and to complete and successfully integrate additional strategic acquisitions. In our four markets, we will continue to focus on building scale in vertical and horizontal domain expertise; developing business with both our government and commercial clients; and replicating our business model in selective geographies. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies.\n \u2022 Completed Contract: Revenue and costs on certain fixed-price contracts are recognized at completion if the final act is so significant to the arrangement that value is deemed to be transferred only at completion. \n \u2022 timing of receipt of invoices from, and payments to, employees and vendors; \n \u2022 federal and state and local governments' and other clients' spending levels; \nOperating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating income was $75.2 million compared to $69.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $5.9 million or 8.5%. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 6.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We incurred lower expenses related to acquisitions, severance and international office closures during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, however the positive margin impact of this reduction was mostly offset by the fair value adjustment of $2.8 million related to contingent consideration for the acquisition of ECA that reduced indirect and selling expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over such lives and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise. As of December 31, 2015, goodwill and intangibles assets were $687.4 million and $58.9 million, respectively.\n \u2022 general market and economic conditions. \n\nOur clients utilize our services because we combine diverse institutional knowledge and experience in their activities with the deep subject-matter expertise of our highly educated staff, which we deploy in multi-disciplinary teams. We categorize our clients into two classifications; government and commercial. Within the government classification, we present three client sub-classifications: federal government, state and local government, and international government.\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements to finance the lease of facilities. We have financed the use of all of our office and storage facilities through operating leases. Operating leases are also used from time to time to finance the use of computers, servers, copiers, telephone systems, and to a lesser extent, other fixed assets, such as furnishings, and we also obtain operating leases in connection with business acquisitions. We generally assume the lease rights and obligations of businesses acquired in business combinations and continue financing facilities and equipment under operating leases until the end of the lease term following the acquisition date.\nWe anticipate that our long-term liquidity requirements, including any future acquisitions, will be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility, additional secured or unsecured debt, or the issuance of common or preferred stock, each of which may be initially funded through borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nYear ended December 31, 2014, compared to year ended December 31, 2013\nBecause a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel, facilities, and related costs, are fixed in the short term, contract performance and variation in the volume of activity, as well as in the number and volume of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter, may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.\nWe are required to adjust stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based on factors such as historical experience and employee class, actual forfeitures may differ from our current estimates. In addition, the estimation of PSAs that will ultimately vest requires judgment based on performance conditions. To the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. See Note K-Accounting for Stock-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense was $10.1 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $5.8 million increase was driven by a higher average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of borrowings to fund the acquisition of Olson, and an increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility due to the increased level of debt outstanding.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of the costs of software we use internally. The increase in depreciation and amortization of 21.3% was primarily due to the acquisition of Olson.\nOur cash flow used in and provided by financing activities consists primarily of debt and equity transactions. For the year ended 2015, cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to net payments on our Credit Facility of $38.5 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $22.3 million. For the year ended 2014, cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily due to net advances on our Credit Facility of $310.1 million, primarily as a result of our acquisitions, partially offset by share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $24.4 million. For the year ended 2013, cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to a net pay down on the Credit Facility of $65.0 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $5.4 million.\nOther expense. Other expense was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the reclassification of $0.5 million of foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of closing one of our international offices.\nWe generate invoices to clients in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract, which may not be directly related to the performance of services. Unbilled receivables are invoiced based upon the achievement of specific events as defined by each contract, including deliverables, timetables, and incurrence of certain costs. Unbilled receivables are classified as a current asset. Advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenue with corresponding costs incurred by us included in the cost of revenue. We record revenue net of taxes collected from customers to be remitted to governmental authorities.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, compared to year ended December 31, 2014\nSELECTED KEY METRICS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in depreciation and amortization of 19.0% was primarily due to an increase in expenses for assets acquired in the latter part of 2013 related to opening new offices, as well as the acquisition of Olson and Mostra.\n\nThe increase in fixed-price contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue and the decrease in time-and-materials contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the increase in fixed-price contracts from the acquisition of Olson. The increase in fixed-price contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue and the decrease in time-and-materials contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, is primarily due to the increase in fixed-price contracts from the acquisition of Olson and Mostra.\n\nFixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks for a pre-determined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-based contracts, fixed-price contracts involve greater financial risk because we bear the full impact of labor and non-labor costs that exceed our estimates, in terms of costs per hour, number of hours, and all other costs of performance in return for the full benefit of any cost savings. We therefore may generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit or, perhaps, incur a loss.\nOther expense. Other expense was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other expense for both periods primarily represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of closing certain international offices as part of actions taken to improve our cost structure and operations.\nOur contractual arrangements are evaluated to assess whether revenue should be recognized on a gross versus net basis. Management's assessment when determining gross versus net revenue recognition is based on several factors such as whether we serve as the primary service provider, have autonomy in selecting subcontractors, or have credit risk, all of which are primary indicators that we serve as the principal to the transaction. In such cases, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. When such indicators are not present and we are primarily functioning as an agent under an arrangement, revenue is recognized on a net basis.\nCityTech. In March 2014, we acquired CityTech, a Chicago-based digital interactive consultancy specializing in enterprise applications development, web experience management, mobile application development, cloud enablement, managed services, and customer experience management solutions. The acquisition adds expertise to our content management capabilities and complements our digital and interactive business.\nLiquidity and Borrowing Capacity. Short-term liquidity requirements are created by our use of funds for working capital, capital expenditures, and the need to provide any debt service. We expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. We entered into our Credit Facility with a syndication of 11 commercial banks on May 16, 2014, which was further modified on November 5, 2014. The Credit Facility matures on May 16, 2019 and allows for borrowings of up to $500.0 million without a borrowing base requirement, taking into account financial, performance-based limitations, and provides for an accordion,\u201d which permits additional revolving credit commitments of up to $100.0 million, subject to lenders' approval. The Credit Facility provides for stand-by letters of credit aggregating up to $30.0 million that reduce the funds available under the Credit Facility when issued. The Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and requires that we remain in compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants, as defined in the Credit Facility, require, among other things, that we maintain, on a consolidated basis for each quarter, a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our covenants under the Credit Facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was 38.1% and 37.6%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily related to unfavorable adjustments for compensation costs and other expenses permanently not deductible for tax purposes. Our effective tax rate, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was lower than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to the true-up of our 2014 tax provision, tax benefit of foreign tax rate differential and state tax credits, partially offset by permanent differences related to compensation costs and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes. We account for the expected impact of discrete tax items once we determine that they are both reasonably quantified and when we are confident they will be realized due to the associated event occurring, such as the filing of an amended tax return, enactment of tax legislation, or the closure of an audit examination.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nECA. In July 2013, we hired the staff of, and purchased certain assets and liabilities from, ECA, an e-commerce technology-based services firm based in New York, New York. The addition of ECA enhanced our multi-channel, end-to-end e-commerce solutions.\n \u2022 additions to, and departures of, staff; \nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n \u2022 timing of award fee notices; \n \u2022 changes in accounting principles and policies; and/or \nDirect Costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $694.4 million compared to $654.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $39.5 million or 6.0%. The increase in direct costs was primarily attributable to direct costs resulting from the acquisition of Olson, partially offset by a reduction in our use of subcontracted labor. Direct costs as a percent of revenue decreased to 61.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 62.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We generally expect the ratio of direct costs as a percentage of revenue to decrease when our own labor increases relative to subcontracted labor.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was 37.6% and 36.8%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily related to non-deductible acquisition costs and other expenses offset by favorable adjustments resulting from the true-up of our 2013 tax provision to our federal and foreign tax return filings, state tax credits, and non-taxable income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit, was lower than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to the true-up of our 2013 tax provision, non-taxable income, foreign and state tax credits partially offset by permanent differences related to acquisition costs and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes.\nWe believe that the combination of internally-generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, potential acquisitions, customary capital expenditures, and other current working capital requirements.\nIn prior years we have had three markets; however, due to the acquisition of Olson near the end of fiscal year 2014, we made certain changes to better reflect our current business starting in the first quarter of 2015. First, we began to break out our revenues into four markets instead of three by adding a new market related to our consumer and financial client revenue, which was previously included in the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market. Second, we changed the name of the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market to health, education and social programs. Finally, we changed the name of our public safety and defense market and renamed it safety and security to more accurately reflect the nature of our client base. The criteria for determining the clients, and related revenue, presented in each of the classifications remains the same.\n \u2022 timing of client orders; \nWe report operating results and financial data as a single segment based on the consolidated information used by our chief operating decision-maker in evaluating the financial performance of our business and allocating resources. Our single segment represents our core business-professional services for government and commercial clients.\nOn June 5, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the ICF International, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, the Omnibus Plan\u201d). The Amendment, among other items, increased the new shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan to 5,090,000. The Omnibus Plan provides for the granting of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards to all officers, key employees, and non-employee directors.\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage of our revenue for each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated.\nOur cash flow used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions. During the year ended 2015, we purchased capital assets totaling $12.7 million and paid approximately $1.8 million related to a holdback adjustment for our 2014 acquisition of Olson. During the year ended 2014, we paid approximately $347.9 million for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and purchased capital assets totaling $10.6 million. During the year ended 2013, we paid approximately $4.8 million for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and purchased capital assets totaling $11.9 million.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of September 30 of each year. For the purposes of performing this review, we have concluded that we have one reporting unit. For the annual impairment review as of September 30, 2015, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that our reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, we may conclude that no impairment exists. If we conclude otherwise, a two-step goodwill impairment test must be performed, which includes a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value.\nOlson. On November 5, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Olson, a leading provider of marketing technology and digital services based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As a result of the acquisition, Olson became our wholly owned subsidiary. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $298.2 million in cash was funded by our Credit Facility. The acquisition expanded our existing digital technology and strategic communications work and strengthened our ability to bring more integrated solutions to an expanded client base, including multi-channel marketing initiatives across web, mobile, email, social, print, broadcast and off-premise platforms.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. In 2014, we added Mostra, CityTech and Olson; and in 2013, we added ECA.\n \u2022 progress of contract performance; \n \u2022 number of billable days in a quarter; \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $311.5 million borrowed under the Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit of $3.7 million, resulting in unused borrowing capacity of $184.8 million under our Credit Facility (excluding the accordion), which is available for our working capital needs and for other purposes. Taking into account certain financial, performance-based limitations, available borrowing capacity (excluding the accordion) was $131.9 million.\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nThe following table shows our revenue from each of our four key markets as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. For each client, we have attributed all revenue from that client to the market we consider to be the client's primary market, even if a portion of that revenue relates to a different market.\n \u2022 commencement, completion, and termination of contracts; \nCash Flow. We consider cash on deposit and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the following years.\nWe have the ability to borrow funds under our Credit Facility at interest rates based on both LIBOR and prime rates, at our discretion, plus their applicable margins. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.23% and 2.41%, respectively.\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $1,132.2 million, compared to $1,050.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $82.1 million or 7.8%. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the 25.0% increase in revenue from commercial clients, which was the result of higher revenue from digital services, driven largely by the Olson acquisition. Total government revenue was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Increases in federal government revenue and state and local government revenue of 1.5% and 5.0%, respectively, were mostly offset by lower international government revenue, which was driven by the weakening of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Canadian dollar. As a result of the acquisitions of Olson and CityTech and future growth expectations for our commercial business, we expect that commercial revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\nAlthough we describe our multiple service offerings to four markets to provide a better understanding of our business, we do not manage our business or allocate our resources based on those service offerings or markets.\nDirect Costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $654.9 million, compared to $591.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $63.4 million or 10.7%. The increase in direct costs is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Olson, Mostra and CityTech. Direct costs as a percent of revenue of 62.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 were consistent with direct costs as a percent of revenue of 62.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $1,050.1 million, compared to $949.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing an increase of $100.8 million or 10.6%. The increase in revenue was due to the 7.1% increase in government revenue, as well as the 19.5% increase in revenue from commercial clients. The increase in government revenue was primarily attributable to international government revenue from the acquisition of Mostra, as well as revenue generated from state and local government clients. The increase in revenue from commercial clients was primarily driven by growth in digital interactive program revenues from the Olson and CityTech acquisitions, as well as energy and healthcare related program revenues. The growth in government and commercial revenue was partially offset by a decline in federal government revenue, largely driven by a decline in the public safety and defense market and the impact of severe weather experienced by our operations on the east coast of the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014. We estimated that the impact of the severe weather on first quarter revenues was approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million.\nStock-based Compensation\n \u2022 extraordinary economic events and natural disasters; \n \u2022 Time-and-Materials Contracts. Revenue for time-and-materials contracts is recorded on the basis of allowable labor hours worked multiplied by the contract-defined billing rates, plus the costs of other items used in the performance of the contract. Profits and losses on time-and-materials contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract-defined billing rates for these services. \n \u2022 level and cost of our debt; \nOur contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors, including our business strategies and the procurement activities of our clients. Unless the context requires otherwise, we use the term contracts\u201d to refer to contracts and any task orders or delivery orders issued under a contract. We have three main types of contracts, time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, and cost-based contracts, described further below.\nNew accounting standards are discussed in Note B-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We enter into three types of contracts: time-and-materials, cost-based and fixed-price.\nRevenue recognition requires us to use judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and costs or other variables, and making assumptions for scheduling and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of revenue and estimates at completion can be complicated and are subject to many variables. Contract costs include labor, subcontractor costs, and other direct costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. At times, we must also make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages, prices for subcontractors, and other direct costs. From time to time, facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs or hours and thus the associated revenue on a contract. To the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized, we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known. A provision for the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result, operating results could be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\n \u2022 changes in the scope of contracts; \nOur 2014 acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech have contributed to the continued diversification of our revenue sources, consistent with our growth strategy. The acquisition of Olson, a leading provider of marketing technology and digital services, was significant and was completed on November 5, 2014. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $298.2 million in cash was funded by our Fourth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d). Due to the increased level of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility, applicable interest rates, as determined by the pricing matrices governing the Credit Facility, increased approximately one percentage point following the acquisition. We anticipate that interest expense will decrease over the next 12 months based on our expectation of a reduction in the average balance of debt outstanding. In 2015, amortization of intangibles increased $6.7 million, largely due to the acquisition of Olson; however we expect this amortization to decrease over the next 12 months as some of these intangibles assets become fully amortized. As a result of the acquisitions of Olson and CityTech and future growth expectations for our commercial business, we anticipate our concentration of revenue to commercial clients and revenue within the consumer and financial market will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\n \u2022 variations in purchasing patterns under our contracts; \nCost-based contracts. Under cost-based contracts, (which include cost-based fixed fee, cost-based award fee, and cost-based incentive fee contracts, as well as grants and cooperative agreements), we are paid based on the allowable costs we incur, and usually receive a fee. All of our cost-based contracts reimburse us for our direct labor and fringe-benefit costs that are allowable under the contract; however, certain contracts limit the amount of overhead and general and administrative costs we can recover, which may be less than our actual overhead and general and administrative costs. In addition, our fees are constrained by fee ceilings and, in certain cases, such as with grants and cooperative agreements, we may receive no fee. Because of these limitations, our cost-based contracts, on average, are our least profitable type of contract, and we may generate less than the expected profit, or perhaps, incur a loss. Cost-based fixed-fee contracts specify the fee to be paid. Cost-based incentive-fee and cost-based award-fee contracts provide for increases or decreases in the contract fee, within specified limits, based upon actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, quality, schedule, and performance.\nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $329.2 million compared to $302.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $27.1 million or 9.0%. Indirect and selling expenses include our management, facilities, and infrastructure costs for all employees, as well as salaries and wages, including stock-based compensation provided to employees whose compensation and other benefit costs are included in indirect and selling expenses, plus associated fringe benefits, not directly related to client engagements. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the Olson acquisition. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $2.8 million reduction to indirect and selling expenses related to a fair value adjustment for contingent consideration recorded as a result of the ECA acquisition. Indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years, although we cannot ensure that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 10 outstanding letters of credit provided for under our Credit Facility with a total value of $3.7 million primarily related to deposits to support our facility leases.\nWe utilize cash-settled RSUs ( CSRSUs\u201d), which are settled only in cash payments. The cash payment is based on the fair value of our stock price at the vesting date, calculated by multiplying the number of CSRSUs vested by our closing stock price on the vesting date, subject to a maximum payment cap and a minimum payment floor. We also grant awards of unregistered shares to our non-employee directors under our Annual Equity Election program. The awards are issued from our treasury stock and have no impact on the shares available for grant under the Omnibus Plan.\nFinancial Condition. There were several changes in our balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash decreased to $7.7 million on December 31, 2015, from $12.1 million on December 31, 2014 and long-term debt decreased to $311.5 million on December 31, 2015, from $350.1 million on December 31, 2014. Contract receivables, net, of $259.8 million on December 31, 2015 was generally consistent with the prior year, while days-sales-outstanding decreased to 73 days on December 31, 2015, as compared to 74 days on December 31, 2014. Accrued salaries and benefits and accounts payable decreased $13.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and days-payables-outstanding decreased from 58 days as of December 31, 2014 to 53 days as of December 31, 2015. Treasury stock increased $24.7 million primarily due to share buybacks under our share repurchase plan. The $5.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss was driven by the devaluation of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Canadian dollar.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. If any of these estimates or judgments prove to be incorrect, our reported results could be materially affected. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting practices described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and therefore consider them to be critical accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies listed below, are more fully described and discussed in Note B-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n \u2022 our contract mix and use of subcontractors; \nOperating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2014, operating income was $69.4 million compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $4.7 million or 7.2%. Operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, operating income included actions taken to improve our cost structure and operations including $1.9 million for severance costs and $1.3 million as a result of closing certain international offices. Operating income also included $2.2 million of acquisition costs, approximately $2.7 million of losses incurred on projects acquired as part of our acquisition of ECA, and approximately $1.6 million to $2.0 million of losses due to severe weather experienced by our operations on the east coast of the U.S. The negative margin impact of these items was partially offset by a change in the fair value of contingent consideration in the amount of $2.8 million related to the acquisition of ECA, and the positive impact on operating income from the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions.\nWe are required to review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by the acquisition of Olson. The fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech.\nOur results of operations and cash flow may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 timing of events related to discrete tax items; \n\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense was $4.3 million, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by a higher average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech, and an increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility due to the increased level of debt outstanding.\nWe have explored various options of mitigating the risk associated with potential fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which we conduct transactions. We currently have hedges in an amount proportionate to work anticipated to be performed under certain contracts in Europe. We recognize changes in the fair-value of the hedges in our results of operations. We may increase the number, size and scope of our hedges as we analyze options for mitigating our foreign exchange risk. The current impact of the hedges to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those anticipated include those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n \u2022 Proportional Performance: Revenue on certain fixed-price contracts is recognized based on proportional performance when the provision of services extends beyond an accounting period with more than one discrete performance act, and progress towards completion can be measured based on a reliable output or input. Under this method, revenue is recorded each period based upon certain contract performance input measures incurred (labor hours, labor costs, or total costs) or output measures completed, expressed as a proportion of a total project estimate. Progress on a contract is monitored regularly to ensure that revenue recognized reflects project status. When hours or costs incurred are used as the basis for revenue recognition, the hours or costs incurred represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures of contract performance, including the presentation of deliverables to the client. Clients are obligated to pay as services are performed, and in the event that a client cancels the contract, payment for services performed through the date of cancellation is typically negotiated with the client. \nTime-and-materials contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials, other direct costs, and out-of-pocket expenses. Our actual labor costs may vary from the expected costs that formed the basis for our negotiated hourly rates if we utilize different employees than anticipated, need to hire additional employees at higher wages, increase the compensation paid to existing employees, or are able to hire employees at lower-than-expected rates. Our non-labor costs, such as fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative costs, also may be higher or lower than we anticipated. To the extent that our actual labor and non-labor costs under a time-and-materials contract vary significantly from our expected costs or the negotiated hourly rates, we can generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit or, perhaps, incur a loss.\n \u2022 Straight-Line: When services are performed or are expected to be performed consistently throughout an arrangement, or when we are compensated on a retainer or fixed-fee basis, revenue is recognized ratably over the period benefited. \nFederal government revenue was 48% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. While we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain near-term challenges facing all government service providers, including top-line legislative constraints on federal government discretionary spending that limit expenditure growth through 2021. Actions by Congress could result in a delay or reduction to our revenue, profit, and cash flow and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations; however, we believe we are well positioned in markets that have been, and will continue to be, priorities to the federal government.\n \u2022 Fixed-Price Contracts. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized when earned, generally as work is performed. Services performed vary from contract to contract and are not always uniformly performed over the term of the arrangement. Fixed-price contracts may contain multiple elements that must be evaluated to determine if they represent separate units of accounting that have stand-alone value. If the assessment is made that there is more than one unit of accounting, the contract value is then allocated to each unit based upon management's best estimate of selling price and the appropriate revenue recognition method is applied to each unit. We recognize revenue in a number of different ways on fixed-price contracts based upon the nature of the services to be provided and an assessment of what best mirrors the pattern of performance for the deliverable/contract, including: ", "item_7_text": "\nContract mix\n \u2022 timing of billings to, and payments by, clients; \nMostra. In February 2014, we completed the acquisition of Mostra, a strategic communications consulting company based in Brussels, Belgium. Mostra offers end-to-end, multichannel communications solutions to assist government and commercial clients, in particular the European Commission. The acquisition extends our strategic communications capabilities globally to complement our policy work and enhance our strategy of providing a full suite of services that leverage our research and advisory services.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 that require us to make future cash payments. Our summary of contractual obligations includes payments that we have an unconditional obligation to make.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $10.4 million compared to $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 10.1% increase was primarily due to amortization resulting from the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions, partly offset by lower amortization of intangible assets related to acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized.\n \u2022 changes in staff utilization; \nIn 2015, we saw growth in commercial client revenue, federal government revenue, and state and local government revenue, which was partially offset by lower international government revenue, primarily due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Revenue increased to $1,132.2 million, representing growth of approximately 7.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year. Operating income increased 8.5% to $75.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the prior year; however, net income declined 1.7% to $39.4 million, largely driven by higher interest expense due to borrowings to fund the Olson acquisition, as well as an increase in amortization for intangible assets resulting from the Olson acquisition.\nOur operating cash flow is primarily affected by the overall profitability of our contracts, our ability to invoice and collect from our clients in a timely manner, and our ability to manage our vendor payments. We bill most of our clients monthly after services are rendered. Operating activities provided cash in each of the years 2015, 2014, and 2013 of $76.3 million, $79.2 million, and $80.8 million, respectively. Cash flows from operating activities for 2015 were positively impacted by net income and income tax receivable and payable, partially offset by accrued salaries and benefits and accrued expenses. Cash flows from operating activities for 2014 were positively impacted by net income, accounts payable and accrued salaries and benefits, partially offset by income tax receivable and payable, contract receivables and deferred revenue. Cash flows from operating activities for 2013 were positively impacted by net income, income tax receivable and payable and accrued salaries and benefits, partially offset by prepaid and other assets.\nAmortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $17.2 million compared to $10.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $6.7 million increase was primarily due to the addition of $64.9 million of intangible assets as a result of the Olson acquisition, partly offset by reduced amortization related to intangible assets from acquisitions in prior years that were fully amortized.\nThe following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of comprehensive income and the period-over-period rate of change in each of them and expresses these items as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nIn prior years we have had three markets; however, due to the acquisition of Olson near the end of fiscal year 2014, we made certain changes to better reflect our current business starting in the first quarter of 2015. First, we began to break out our revenues into four markets instead of three by adding a new market related to our consumer and financial client revenue, which was previously included in the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market. Second, we changed the name of the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market to health, education and social programs. Finally, we changed the name of our public safety and defense market and renamed it safety and security to more accurately reflect the nature of our client base. The criteria for determining the clients, and related revenue, presented in each of the classifications remains the same. In addition, certain revenue amounts in the prior year have been reclassified due to minor adjustments.\nWe may proceed with work based upon client direction prior to the completion and signing of formal contract documents. We have a review process for approving any such work. Revenue associated with such work is recognized only when it can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. We base our estimates on a variety of factors, including previous experiences with the client, communications with the client regarding funding status, and our knowledge of available funding for the contract.\nACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS COMBINATIONS\nWe recognized total compensation expense relating to stock-based compensation of $14.7 million, $13.4 million, and $11.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We recognize stock-based compensation expense for stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs and CSRSUs on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period. We recognize expense for performance-based share awards ( PSAs\u201d), which are subject to a performance condition and a market condition, on a straight-line basis over the performance period. Non-employee director awards do not include vesting conditions and therefore are expensed when issued.\nOur major clients are federal government departments and agencies. Our federal government clients have included every cabinet-level department, most significantly HHS, DOS, and DoD. Federal government clients generated approximately 48%, 51%, and 58% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. State and local government clients generated approximately 10%, 10%, and 9% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. International government clients generated approximately 7%, 9%, and 5% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.\nCompensation expense is based on the estimated fair value of these instruments and the estimated number of shares we ultimately expect will vest. The calculation of the fair value of our awards requires certain inputs that are subjective and changes to the estimates used will cause the fair value of our stock awards and related stock-based compensation expense to vary. The fair value of stock options, restricted stock awards, RSUs, PSAs and non-employee director awards is estimated based on the fair value of a share of common stock at the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options. The fair value of a stock option award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant, as well as other assumptions used as inputs in the valuation model including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards, the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options and the risk-free interest rate assumption. The fair value of PSAs is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model. We treat CSRSUs as liability-classified awards, and therefore account for them at fair value estimated based on the closing price of our stock at the reporting date.\nThe acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method. The allocation of the total purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of Olson is based on management's estimate of fair value as of the acquisition date and was completed in the fourth quarter of 2015. We engaged an independent valuation firm to assist management in the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and to other acquired intangible assets. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net tangible assets acquired was approximately $293.4 million. We allocated approximately $228.5 million to goodwill and $64.9 million to other intangible assets. See Note F-Business Combinations\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for a more detailed discussion of this acquisition.\nChanges in the mix of services and other direct costs provided under our contracts can result in variability in our direct costs as a percentage of revenue. For example, when we perform work in the area of implementation, we expect that more of our services will be performed in client-provided facilities and/or with dedicated staff. Such work generally has a higher proportion of direct costs than much of our current research and advisory work, and we anticipate that higher utilization of such staff will decrease indirect expenses. In addition, to the extent we are successful in winning larger contracts, our own labor services component could decrease because larger contracts typically are broader in scope and require more diverse capabilities, potentially resulting in more subcontracted labor, more other direct costs, and lower margins. Although these factors could lead to a higher ratio of direct costs as a percentage of revenue, the economics of these larger jobs are nonetheless generally favorable because they increase income, broaden our revenue base, and have a favorable return on invested capital.\n \u2022 timing of significant costs and investments (such as bid and proposal costs and the costs involved in planning or making acquisitions); \nOur primary clients are the agencies and departments of the federal government and commercial clients. Most of our revenue is from contracts on which we are the prime contractor, which we believe provides us strong client relationships. In 2015, 2014, and 2013, approximately 85%, 86%, and 86% of our revenue, respectively, was from prime contracts. The following table shows our revenue by type of client as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. Certain immaterial revenue amounts in the prior year have been reclassified due to minor adjustments.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n(1) Represents the obligation for principal and variable interest payments related to the Credit Facility assuming the principal amount outstanding and interest rates at December 31, 2015 remain fixed through maturity. These assumptions are subject to change in future periods.\nWe believe that the combination of internally generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, customary capital expenditures, and other current working capital requirements. We are continuously analyzing our capital structure to ensure we have sufficient capital to fund future acquisitions and internal growth. We monitor the state of the financial markets on a regular basis to assess the availability and cost of additional capital resources both from debt and equity sources. We believe that we will be able to access these markets at commercially reasonable terms and conditions if we need additional borrowings or capital.\n \u2022 Cost-Based Contracts. Revenue under cost-based contracts is recognized as costs are incurred. Applicable estimated profit, if any, is included in earnings in the proportion that incurred costs bear to total estimated costs. Incentives, award fees, or penalties related to performance are also considered in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards, taking into consideration factors such as our prior award experience and communications with the customer regarding performance. \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $302.0 million, compared to $272.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $29.6 million or 10.9%. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in non-labor expense, driven by a reduction in the fair value of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of ECA of $2.8 million. Indirect and selling expenses were 28.7% as a percent of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nWe provide professional services and technology-based solutions to government and commercial clients, including management, technology, and policy consulting and implementation services. We help our clients conceive, develop, implement, and improve solutions that address complex natural resource, social, and public safety issues. Our services primarily address four key markets: energy, environment, and infrastructure; health, education and social programs; safety and security; and consumer and financial. We provide services across these four markets that deliver value throughout the entire life cycle of a policy, program, project, or initiative, from research and analysis and assessment and advice to design and implementation of programs and technology-based solutions, and the provision of engagement services and programs.\n(dollars in thousands)\n \u2022 paid time off taken by our employees; \nOur qualitative analysis as of September 30, 2015 included macroeconomic and industry and market-specific considerations, financial performance indicators and measurements, and other factors. Based on our qualitative assessment, we determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of our one reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, and thus the two-step impairment test was not required to be performed for 2015. Therefore, based upon management's review, no goodwill impairment charge was required as of September 30, 2015. Historically, we have recorded no goodwill impairment charges.\nThe fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by the acquisition of Olson. The fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech.\nWe also serve a variety of commercial clients worldwide, including airlines, airports, electric and gas utilities, oil companies, hospitals, health insurers, and other health-related companies, banks and other financial services companies, transportation, travel and hospitality firms, non-profits/associations, law firms, manufacturing firms, retail chains, and distribution companies. Our commercial clients, which include clients outside the U.S., generated approximately 35%, 30%, and 28% of our revenue in 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. We have successfully worked with many of our clients for decades, with the result that we have a unique and knowledgeable perspective on their needs.\n \u2022 strategic decisions we make, such as acquisitions, consolidations, divestments, spin-offs, joint ventures, strategic investments, and changes in business strategy; \n \u2022 Specific Performance: When the services to be performed consist of a single act, revenue is recognized at the time the act is performed or at the completion of the single service. \nContractual Obligations\nWe believe that demand for our services will continue to grow as government, industry, and other stakeholders seek to address critical long-term societal and natural resource issues in our key markets due to heightened concerns about clean energy and energy efficiency; health promotion, treatment, and cost control; and ongoing homeland security threats. We also see significant opportunity to leverage further our digital and client engagement capabilities across our commercial and government client base. Our future results will depend on the success of our strategy to enhance our client relationships and seek larger engagements across the program life cycle in our four key markets, and to complete and successfully integrate additional strategic acquisitions. In our four markets, we will continue to focus on building scale in vertical and horizontal domain expertise; developing business with both our government and commercial clients; and replicating our business model in selective geographies. In doing so, we will continue to evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that enhance our subject matter knowledge, broaden our service offerings, and/or provide scale in specific geographies.\n \u2022 Completed Contract: Revenue and costs on certain fixed-price contracts are recognized at completion if the final act is so significant to the arrangement that value is deemed to be transferred only at completion. \n \u2022 timing of receipt of invoices from, and payments to, employees and vendors; \n \u2022 federal and state and local governments' and other clients' spending levels; \nOperating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2015, operating income was $75.2 million compared to $69.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $5.9 million or 8.5%. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 6.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. We incurred lower expenses related to acquisitions, severance and international office closures during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, however the positive margin impact of this reduction was mostly offset by the fair value adjustment of $2.8 million related to contingent consideration for the acquisition of ECA that reduced indirect and selling expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe purchase price of an acquired business is allocated to the tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values, with the excess recorded as goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of costs over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized, but instead reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over such lives and reviewed for impairment if impairment indicators arise. As of December 31, 2015, goodwill and intangibles assets were $687.4 million and $58.9 million, respectively.\n \u2022 general market and economic conditions. \n\nOur clients utilize our services because we combine diverse institutional knowledge and experience in their activities with the deep subject-matter expertise of our highly educated staff, which we deploy in multi-disciplinary teams. We categorize our clients into two classifications; government and commercial. Within the government classification, we present three client sub-classifications: federal government, state and local government, and international government.\nWe use off-balance sheet arrangements to finance the lease of facilities. We have financed the use of all of our office and storage facilities through operating leases. Operating leases are also used from time to time to finance the use of computers, servers, copiers, telephone systems, and to a lesser extent, other fixed assets, such as furnishings, and we also obtain operating leases in connection with business acquisitions. We generally assume the lease rights and obligations of businesses acquired in business combinations and continue financing facilities and equipment under operating leases until the end of the lease term following the acquisition date.\nWe anticipate that our long-term liquidity requirements, including any future acquisitions, will be funded through a combination of cash flow from operations, borrowings under our Credit Facility, additional secured or unsecured debt, or the issuance of common or preferred stock, each of which may be initially funded through borrowings under our Credit Facility.\nYear ended December 31, 2014, compared to year ended December 31, 2013\nBecause a significant portion of our expenses, such as personnel, facilities, and related costs, are fixed in the short term, contract performance and variation in the volume of activity, as well as in the number and volume of contracts commenced or completed during any quarter, may cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter.\nWe are required to adjust stock-based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period. Although we estimate the rate of future forfeitures based on factors such as historical experience and employee class, actual forfeitures may differ from our current estimates. In addition, the estimation of PSAs that will ultimately vest requires judgment based on performance conditions. To the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period such estimates are revised. See Note K-Accounting for Stock-based Compensation\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\u201d for further discussion.\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2015, interest expense was $10.1 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $5.8 million increase was driven by a higher average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of borrowings to fund the acquisition of Olson, and an increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility due to the increased level of debt outstanding.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property and equipment and the amortization of the costs of software we use internally. The increase in depreciation and amortization of 21.3% was primarily due to the acquisition of Olson.\nOur cash flow used in and provided by financing activities consists primarily of debt and equity transactions. For the year ended 2015, cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to net payments on our Credit Facility of $38.5 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $22.3 million. For the year ended 2014, cash flow provided by financing activities was primarily due to net advances on our Credit Facility of $310.1 million, primarily as a result of our acquisitions, partially offset by share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $24.4 million. For the year ended 2013, cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to a net pay down on the Credit Facility of $65.0 million, and share repurchases under our share repurchase plan of $5.4 million.\nOther expense. Other expense was $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the reclassification of $0.5 million of foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of closing one of our international offices.\nWe generate invoices to clients in accordance with the terms of the applicable contract, which may not be directly related to the performance of services. Unbilled receivables are invoiced based upon the achievement of specific events as defined by each contract, including deliverables, timetables, and incurrence of certain costs. Unbilled receivables are classified as a current asset. Advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met. Reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses are included in revenue with corresponding costs incurred by us included in the cost of revenue. We record revenue net of taxes collected from customers to be remitted to governmental authorities.\nYear ended December 31, 2015, compared to year ended December 31, 2014\nSELECTED KEY METRICS\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization was $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to $11.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in depreciation and amortization of 19.0% was primarily due to an increase in expenses for assets acquired in the latter part of 2013 related to opening new offices, as well as the acquisition of Olson and Mostra.\n\nThe increase in fixed-price contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue and the decrease in time-and-materials contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the increase in fixed-price contracts from the acquisition of Olson. The increase in fixed-price contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue and the decrease in time-and-materials contracts revenue as a percent of total revenue, for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, is primarily due to the increase in fixed-price contracts from the acquisition of Olson and Mostra.\n\nFixed-price contracts. Under fixed-price contracts, we perform specific tasks for a pre-determined price. Compared to time-and-materials and cost-based contracts, fixed-price contracts involve greater financial risk because we bear the full impact of labor and non-labor costs that exceed our estimates, in terms of costs per hour, number of hours, and all other costs of performance in return for the full benefit of any cost savings. We therefore may generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit or, perhaps, incur a loss.\nOther expense. Other expense was $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Other expense for both periods primarily represented the reclassification of foreign currency translation losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings as a result of closing certain international offices as part of actions taken to improve our cost structure and operations.\nOur contractual arrangements are evaluated to assess whether revenue should be recognized on a gross versus net basis. Management's assessment when determining gross versus net revenue recognition is based on several factors such as whether we serve as the primary service provider, have autonomy in selecting subcontractors, or have credit risk, all of which are primary indicators that we serve as the principal to the transaction. In such cases, revenue is recognized on a gross basis. When such indicators are not present and we are primarily functioning as an agent under an arrangement, revenue is recognized on a net basis.\nCityTech. In March 2014, we acquired CityTech, a Chicago-based digital interactive consultancy specializing in enterprise applications development, web experience management, mobile application development, cloud enablement, managed services, and customer experience management solutions. The acquisition adds expertise to our content management capabilities and complements our digital and interactive business.\nLiquidity and Borrowing Capacity. Short-term liquidity requirements are created by our use of funds for working capital, capital expenditures, and the need to provide any debt service. We expect to meet these requirements through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under our Credit Facility. We entered into our Credit Facility with a syndication of 11 commercial banks on May 16, 2014, which was further modified on November 5, 2014. The Credit Facility matures on May 16, 2019 and allows for borrowings of up to $500.0 million without a borrowing base requirement, taking into account financial, performance-based limitations, and provides for an accordion,\u201d which permits additional revolving credit commitments of up to $100.0 million, subject to lenders' approval. The Credit Facility provides for stand-by letters of credit aggregating up to $30.0 million that reduce the funds available under the Credit Facility when issued. The Credit Facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets and requires that we remain in compliance with certain financial and non-financial covenants. The financial covenants, as defined in the Credit Facility, require, among other things, that we maintain, on a consolidated basis for each quarter, a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than 1.25 to 1.00 and a leverage ratio of not more than 3.75 to 1.00. As of December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with our covenants under the Credit Facility.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, was 38.1% and 37.6%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily related to unfavorable adjustments for compensation costs and other expenses permanently not deductible for tax purposes. Our effective tax rate, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit, for the year ended December 31, 2015 was lower than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to the true-up of our 2014 tax provision, tax benefit of foreign tax rate differential and state tax credits, partially offset by permanent differences related to compensation costs and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes. We account for the expected impact of discrete tax items once we determine that they are both reasonably quantified and when we are confident they will be realized due to the associated event occurring, such as the filing of an amended tax return, enactment of tax legislation, or the closure of an audit examination.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nECA. In July 2013, we hired the staff of, and purchased certain assets and liabilities from, ECA, an e-commerce technology-based services firm based in New York, New York. The addition of ECA enhanced our multi-channel, end-to-end e-commerce solutions.\n \u2022 additions to, and departures of, staff; \nYears Ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013\n \u2022 timing of award fee notices; \n \u2022 changes in accounting principles and policies; and/or \nDirect Costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $694.4 million compared to $654.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $39.5 million or 6.0%. The increase in direct costs was primarily attributable to direct costs resulting from the acquisition of Olson, partially offset by a reduction in our use of subcontracted labor. Direct costs as a percent of revenue decreased to 61.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 62.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. We generally expect the ratio of direct costs as a percentage of revenue to decrease when our own labor increases relative to subcontracted labor.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, and December 31, 2013, was 37.6% and 36.8%, respectively. The rate increase was primarily related to non-deductible acquisition costs and other expenses offset by favorable adjustments resulting from the true-up of our 2013 tax provision to our federal and foreign tax return filings, state tax credits, and non-taxable income. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014, including state and foreign taxes net of federal benefit, was lower than the statutory tax rate for the year primarily due to the true-up of our 2013 tax provision, non-taxable income, foreign and state tax credits partially offset by permanent differences related to acquisition costs and other expenses not deductible for tax purposes.\nWe believe that the combination of internally-generated funds, available bank borrowings, and cash and cash equivalents on hand will provide the required liquidity and capital resources necessary to fund on-going operations, potential acquisitions, customary capital expenditures, and other current working capital requirements.\nIn prior years we have had three markets; however, due to the acquisition of Olson near the end of fiscal year 2014, we made certain changes to better reflect our current business starting in the first quarter of 2015. First, we began to break out our revenues into four markets instead of three by adding a new market related to our consumer and financial client revenue, which was previously included in the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market. Second, we changed the name of the health, social programs, and consumer/financial market to health, education and social programs. Finally, we changed the name of our public safety and defense market and renamed it safety and security to more accurately reflect the nature of our client base. The criteria for determining the clients, and related revenue, presented in each of the classifications remains the same.\n \u2022 timing of client orders; \nWe report operating results and financial data as a single segment based on the consolidated information used by our chief operating decision-maker in evaluating the financial performance of our business and allocating resources. Our single segment represents our core business-professional services for government and commercial clients.\nOn June 5, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment (the Amendment\u201d) to the ICF International, Inc. 2010 Omnibus Incentive Plan (as amended, the Omnibus Plan\u201d). The Amendment, among other items, increased the new shares available for issuance under the Omnibus Plan to 5,090,000. The Omnibus Plan provides for the granting of options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units ( RSUs\u201d), performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards, and other stock-based awards to all officers, key employees, and non-employee directors.\nThe following table shows the approximate percentage of our revenue for each of these types of contracts for the periods indicated.\nOur cash flow used in investing activities consists primarily of capital expenditures and acquisitions. During the year ended 2015, we purchased capital assets totaling $12.7 million and paid approximately $1.8 million related to a holdback adjustment for our 2014 acquisition of Olson. During the year ended 2014, we paid approximately $347.9 million for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and purchased capital assets totaling $10.6 million. During the year ended 2013, we paid approximately $4.8 million for business acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and purchased capital assets totaling $11.9 million.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe perform our annual goodwill impairment review as of September 30 of each year. For the purposes of performing this review, we have concluded that we have one reporting unit. For the annual impairment review as of September 30, 2015, we opted to perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that our reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying amount. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, we may conclude that no impairment exists. If we conclude otherwise, a two-step goodwill impairment test must be performed, which includes a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value.\nOlson. On November 5, 2014, we completed the acquisition of Olson, a leading provider of marketing technology and digital services based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As a result of the acquisition, Olson became our wholly owned subsidiary. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $298.2 million in cash was funded by our Credit Facility. The acquisition expanded our existing digital technology and strategic communications work and strengthened our ability to bring more integrated solutions to an expanded client base, including multi-channel marketing initiatives across web, mobile, email, social, print, broadcast and off-premise platforms.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to pursue acquisitions. In 2014, we added Mostra, CityTech and Olson; and in 2013, we added ECA.\n \u2022 progress of contract performance; \n \u2022 number of billable days in a quarter; \nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $311.5 million borrowed under the Credit Facility and outstanding letters of credit of $3.7 million, resulting in unused borrowing capacity of $184.8 million under our Credit Facility (excluding the accordion), which is available for our working capital needs and for other purposes. Taking into account certain financial, performance-based limitations, available borrowing capacity (excluding the accordion) was $131.9 million.\nOVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK\nThe following table shows our revenue from each of our four key markets as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated. For each client, we have attributed all revenue from that client to the market we consider to be the client's primary market, even if a portion of that revenue relates to a different market.\n \u2022 commencement, completion, and termination of contracts; \nCash Flow. We consider cash on deposit and all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents. The following table sets forth our sources and uses of cash for the following years.\nWe have the ability to borrow funds under our Credit Facility at interest rates based on both LIBOR and prime rates, at our discretion, plus their applicable margins. The weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2015 and 2014 was 2.23% and 2.41%, respectively.\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, was $1,132.2 million, compared to $1,050.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, representing an increase of $82.1 million or 7.8%. The increase in revenue was primarily attributable to the 25.0% increase in revenue from commercial clients, which was the result of higher revenue from digital services, driven largely by the Olson acquisition. Total government revenue was relatively flat for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Increases in federal government revenue and state and local government revenue of 1.5% and 5.0%, respectively, were mostly offset by lower international government revenue, which was driven by the weakening of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Canadian dollar. As a result of the acquisitions of Olson and CityTech and future growth expectations for our commercial business, we expect that commercial revenue will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\nAlthough we describe our multiple service offerings to four markets to provide a better understanding of our business, we do not manage our business or allocate our resources based on those service offerings or markets.\nDirect Costs. Direct costs for the year ended December 31, 2014, were $654.9 million, compared to $591.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $63.4 million or 10.7%. The increase in direct costs is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Olson, Mostra and CityTech. Direct costs as a percent of revenue of 62.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014 were consistent with direct costs as a percent of revenue of 62.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nRevenue. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014, was $1,050.1 million, compared to $949.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, representing an increase of $100.8 million or 10.6%. The increase in revenue was due to the 7.1% increase in government revenue, as well as the 19.5% increase in revenue from commercial clients. The increase in government revenue was primarily attributable to international government revenue from the acquisition of Mostra, as well as revenue generated from state and local government clients. The increase in revenue from commercial clients was primarily driven by growth in digital interactive program revenues from the Olson and CityTech acquisitions, as well as energy and healthcare related program revenues. The growth in government and commercial revenue was partially offset by a decline in federal government revenue, largely driven by a decline in the public safety and defense market and the impact of severe weather experienced by our operations on the east coast of the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014. We estimated that the impact of the severe weather on first quarter revenues was approximately $4.0 million to $5.0 million.\nStock-based Compensation\n \u2022 extraordinary economic events and natural disasters; \n \u2022 Time-and-Materials Contracts. Revenue for time-and-materials contracts is recorded on the basis of allowable labor hours worked multiplied by the contract-defined billing rates, plus the costs of other items used in the performance of the contract. Profits and losses on time-and-materials contracts result from the difference between the cost of services performed and the contract-defined billing rates for these services. \n \u2022 level and cost of our debt; \nOur contract mix varies from year to year due to numerous factors, including our business strategies and the procurement activities of our clients. Unless the context requires otherwise, we use the term contracts\u201d to refer to contracts and any task orders or delivery orders issued under a contract. We have three main types of contracts, time-and-materials contracts, fixed-price contracts, and cost-based contracts, described further below.\nNew accounting standards are discussed in Note B-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\nWe recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We enter into three types of contracts: time-and-materials, cost-based and fixed-price.\nRevenue recognition requires us to use judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenue and costs or other variables, and making assumptions for scheduling and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of revenue and estimates at completion can be complicated and are subject to many variables. Contract costs include labor, subcontractor costs, and other direct costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. At times, we must also make assumptions regarding the length of time to complete the contract because costs include expected increases in wages, prices for subcontractors, and other direct costs. From time to time, facts develop that require us to revise our estimated total costs or hours and thus the associated revenue on a contract. To the extent that a revised estimate affects contract profit or revenue previously recognized, we record the cumulative effect of the revision in the period in which the facts requiring the revision become known. A provision for the full amount of an anticipated loss on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. As a result, operating results could be affected by revisions to prior accounting estimates.\n \u2022 changes in the scope of contracts; \nOur 2014 acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech have contributed to the continued diversification of our revenue sources, consistent with our growth strategy. The acquisition of Olson, a leading provider of marketing technology and digital services, was significant and was completed on November 5, 2014. The aggregate purchase price of approximately $298.2 million in cash was funded by our Fourth Amended and Restated Business Loan and Security Agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d). Due to the increased level of debt outstanding under our Credit Facility, applicable interest rates, as determined by the pricing matrices governing the Credit Facility, increased approximately one percentage point following the acquisition. We anticipate that interest expense will decrease over the next 12 months based on our expectation of a reduction in the average balance of debt outstanding. In 2015, amortization of intangibles increased $6.7 million, largely due to the acquisition of Olson; however we expect this amortization to decrease over the next 12 months as some of these intangibles assets become fully amortized. As a result of the acquisitions of Olson and CityTech and future growth expectations for our commercial business, we anticipate our concentration of revenue to commercial clients and revenue within the consumer and financial market will continue to increase as a percentage of our total revenue.\n \u2022 variations in purchasing patterns under our contracts; \nCost-based contracts. Under cost-based contracts, (which include cost-based fixed fee, cost-based award fee, and cost-based incentive fee contracts, as well as grants and cooperative agreements), we are paid based on the allowable costs we incur, and usually receive a fee. All of our cost-based contracts reimburse us for our direct labor and fringe-benefit costs that are allowable under the contract; however, certain contracts limit the amount of overhead and general and administrative costs we can recover, which may be less than our actual overhead and general and administrative costs. In addition, our fees are constrained by fee ceilings and, in certain cases, such as with grants and cooperative agreements, we may receive no fee. Because of these limitations, our cost-based contracts, on average, are our least profitable type of contract, and we may generate less than the expected profit, or perhaps, incur a loss. Cost-based fixed-fee contracts specify the fee to be paid. Cost-based incentive-fee and cost-based award-fee contracts provide for increases or decreases in the contract fee, within specified limits, based upon actual results as compared to contractual targets for factors such as cost, quality, schedule, and performance.\nIndirect and selling expenses. Indirect and selling expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, were $329.2 million compared to $302.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $27.1 million or 9.0%. Indirect and selling expenses include our management, facilities, and infrastructure costs for all employees, as well as salaries and wages, including stock-based compensation provided to employees whose compensation and other benefit costs are included in indirect and selling expenses, plus associated fringe benefits, not directly related to client engagements. The increase in indirect and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the Olson acquisition. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $2.8 million reduction to indirect and selling expenses related to a fair value adjustment for contingent consideration recorded as a result of the ECA acquisition. Indirect and selling expenses as a percent of revenue increased to 29.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to 28.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nWe generally have been able to price our contracts in a manner that accommodates the rates of inflation experienced in recent years, although we cannot ensure that we will be able to do so in the future.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had 10 outstanding letters of credit provided for under our Credit Facility with a total value of $3.7 million primarily related to deposits to support our facility leases.\nWe utilize cash-settled RSUs ( CSRSUs\u201d), which are settled only in cash payments. The cash payment is based on the fair value of our stock price at the vesting date, calculated by multiplying the number of CSRSUs vested by our closing stock price on the vesting date, subject to a maximum payment cap and a minimum payment floor. We also grant awards of unregistered shares to our non-employee directors under our Annual Equity Election program. The awards are issued from our treasury stock and have no impact on the shares available for grant under the Omnibus Plan.\nFinancial Condition. There were several changes in our balance sheet during the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash decreased to $7.7 million on December 31, 2015, from $12.1 million on December 31, 2014 and long-term debt decreased to $311.5 million on December 31, 2015, from $350.1 million on December 31, 2014. Contract receivables, net, of $259.8 million on December 31, 2015 was generally consistent with the prior year, while days-sales-outstanding decreased to 73 days on December 31, 2015, as compared to 74 days on December 31, 2014. Accrued salaries and benefits and accounts payable decreased $13.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and days-payables-outstanding decreased from 58 days as of December 31, 2014 to 53 days as of December 31, 2015. Treasury stock increased $24.7 million primarily due to share buybacks under our share repurchase plan. The $5.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss was driven by the devaluation of certain foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Canadian dollar.\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. If any of these estimates or judgments prove to be incorrect, our reported results could be materially affected. Actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that the estimates, assumptions, and judgments involved in the accounting practices described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and therefore consider them to be critical accounting policies. Our significant accounting policies, including the critical accounting policies listed below, are more fully described and discussed in Note B-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\u201d\n \u2022 our contract mix and use of subcontractors; \nOperating Income. For the year ended December 31, 2014, operating income was $69.4 million compared to $64.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, an increase of $4.7 million or 7.2%. Operating income as a percent of revenue decreased to 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. During fiscal year 2014, operating income included actions taken to improve our cost structure and operations including $1.9 million for severance costs and $1.3 million as a result of closing certain international offices. Operating income also included $2.2 million of acquisition costs, approximately $2.7 million of losses incurred on projects acquired as part of our acquisition of ECA, and approximately $1.6 million to $2.0 million of losses due to severe weather experienced by our operations on the east coast of the U.S. The negative margin impact of these items was partially offset by a change in the fair value of contingent consideration in the amount of $2.8 million related to the acquisition of ECA, and the positive impact on operating income from the Olson, Mostra and CityTech acquisitions.\nWe are required to review long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value, less cost to sell.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, was primarily driven by the acquisition of Olson. The fluctuation in the percentages of revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the year ended December 31, 2013, was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech.\nOur results of operations and cash flow may vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 timing of events related to discrete tax items; \n\nInterest expense. For the year ended December 31, 2014, interest expense was $4.3 million, compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by a higher average debt balance during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily due to borrowings to fund the acquisitions of Olson, Mostra and CityTech, and an increase in the applicable interest rates under our Credit Facility due to the increased level of debt outstanding.\nWe have explored various options of mitigating the risk associated with potential fluctuations in the foreign currencies in which we conduct transactions. We currently have hedges in an amount proportionate to work anticipated to be performed under certain contracts in Europe. We recognize changes in the fair-value of the hedges in our results of operations. We may increase the number, size and scope of our hedges as we analyze options for mitigating our foreign exchange risk. The current impact of the hedges to the consolidated financial statements is immaterial.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Selected Financial Data\u201d and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. The cautionary statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be read as applying to all related forward-looking statements wherever they appear in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to our actual results differing materially from those anticipated include those discussed in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n \u2022 Proportional Performance: Revenue on certain fixed-price contracts is recognized based on proportional performance when the provision of services extends beyond an accounting period with more than one discrete performance act, and progress towards completion can be measured based on a reliable output or input. Under this method, revenue is recorded each period based upon certain contract performance input measures incurred (labor hours, labor costs, or total costs) or output measures completed, expressed as a proportion of a total project estimate. Progress on a contract is monitored regularly to ensure that revenue recognized reflects project status. When hours or costs incurred are used as the basis for revenue recognition, the hours or costs incurred represent a reasonable surrogate for output measures of contract performance, including the presentation of deliverables to the client. Clients are obligated to pay as services are performed, and in the event that a client cancels the contract, payment for services performed through the date of cancellation is typically negotiated with the client. \nTime-and-materials contracts. Under time-and-materials contracts, we are paid for labor at fixed hourly rates and generally reimbursed separately for allowable materials, other direct costs, and out-of-pocket expenses. Our actual labor costs may vary from the expected costs that formed the basis for our negotiated hourly rates if we utilize different employees than anticipated, need to hire additional employees at higher wages, increase the compensation paid to existing employees, or are able to hire employees at lower-than-expected rates. Our non-labor costs, such as fringe benefits, overhead, and general and administrative costs, also may be higher or lower than we anticipated. To the extent that our actual labor and non-labor costs under a time-and-materials contract vary significantly from our expected costs or the negotiated hourly rates, we can generate more or less than the targeted amount of profit or, perhaps, incur a loss.\n \u2022 Straight-Line: When services are performed or are expected to be performed consistently throughout an arrangement, or when we are compensated on a retainer or fixed-fee basis, revenue is recognized ratably over the period benefited. \nFederal government revenue was 48% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. While we continue to see favorable long-term market opportunities, there are certain near-term challenges facing all government service providers, including top-line legislative constraints on federal government discretionary spending that limit expenditure growth through 2021. Actions by Congress could result in a delay or reduction to our revenue, profit, and cash flow and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations; however, we believe we are well positioned in markets that have been, and will continue to be, priorities to the federal government.\n \u2022 Fixed-Price Contracts. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized when earned, generally as work is performed. Services performed vary from contract to contract and are not always uniformly performed over the term of the arrangement. Fixed-price contracts may contain multiple elements that must be evaluated to determine if they represent separate units of accounting that have stand-alone value. If the assessment is made that there is more than one unit of accounting, the contract value is then allocated to each unit based upon management's best estimate of selling price and the appropriate revenue recognition method is applied to each unit. We recognize revenue in a number of different ways on fixed-price contracts based upon the nature of the services to be provided and an assessment of what best mirrors the pattern of performance for the deliverable/contract, including: ", "item_7_tables": "Table 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands)\n</td>

consulting services company that works with government and commercial clients in four key markets: energy, environment and infrastructure; health, education and social programs; safety and security; and consumer and financial.\n\n- In 2015, revenue increased 7.8% to $1.13 billion, driven by growth in the commercial business, especially digital services, from the acquisition of Olson. Operating income rose 8.5% but net income declined 1.7% due to higher interest expense and amortization costs related to the Olson acquisition. \n\nFinancial Results\n- Revenue growth in 2015 was led by a 25% increase in commercial revenue from the Olson acquisition. Government revenue was flat as increases in federal and state/local were offset by lower international revenue from currency effects.\n\n- Operating income margin held steady at 6.6% as cost reduction benefits were offset by less contingent consideration benefit compared to 2014.\n\n- Higher interest expense and amortization costs led net income to decrease 1.7% in 2015.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- Operating cash flows were $76 million. Key drivers were net income and tax accounts, partially offset by changes in salaries/benefits and expenses.\n\n- Long-term debt decreased due to pay downs but remained significant at $311 million to fund acquisitions like Olson. Unused credit facility capacity stood at $185 million. \n\nAcquisitions\n- 2014 acquisitions expanded ICF's digital capabilities (Olson) and communications offerings (Mostra). Commercial business is expected to continue increasing as a percentage of total revenue.\n\nKey Contract Metrics \n- Contract mix shifted towards more fixed price (38% of revenue in 2015 vs. 34% prior year) due to the Olson acquisition."}
