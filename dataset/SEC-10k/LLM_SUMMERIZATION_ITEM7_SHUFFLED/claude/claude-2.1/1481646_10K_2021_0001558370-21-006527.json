Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes thereto, appearing at the end of this filing. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the sections titled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDiscussion and analysis of our fiscal year 2019, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2020 financial performance to 2019, have been omitted from this section and may be found under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the Final Prospectus for our initial public offering (our IPO) dated as of July 1, 2020 and files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on July 2, 2020. Our fiscal year ends on the last day of February, and our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30, and the last day of February.\nOverview\nWe provide personalized, technology-enabled solutions that help people better understand, navigate, and utilize the healthcare system and their workplace benefits. Our customers are primarily employers that deploy Accolade in order to provide employees and their families (our members\u201d) a single place to turn for their health, healthcare, and benefits needs. Our innovative platform combines open, cloud-based intelligent technology with multimodal support from a team of empathetic and knowledgeable Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians (including nurses, physician medical directors, and behavioral health specialists). We leverage our integrated capabilities, connectivity with providers and the broader healthcare ecosystem, and longitudinal data to engage across the entire member population, rather than focusing solely on high-cost claimants or those with chronic conditions. Our goal is to build trusted relationships with our members that ultimately position us to deliver personalized recommendations and interventions. We believe that our platform dramatically improves the member experience, encourages better health outcomes, and lowers costs for both our members and our customers.\nAccolade Total Health and Benefits is our most comprehensive offering and most closely aligns to our Premier\u201d solution on which the company was founded and from which the majority of our revenues are derived today. Our technology platform has enabled us to unbundle aspects of this comprehensive offering to create two additional standalone offerings: Accolade Total Benefits (focused on member benefits engagement) and Accolade Total Care (focused on guiding members to high-quality, cost-effective providers). We have further leveraged our technology platform to develop add-on offerings, such as Accolade Boost, our Trusted Supplier Program, Accolade COVID Response Care, and Mental Health Integrated Care that target specific challenges faced by our customers. Through our acquisition of Innovation Specialists, LLC d/b/a 2nd.MD (2nd.MD) we also acquired the capability to provide an expert medical consultation and medical decision support service, which may be provided as a standalone service or with elements incorporated into our core offerings.\nWe were founded in 2007 and launched our initial offering in 2009. We have seen significant growth in recent years since the changes to our executive management team in 2015 and the subsequent investments we have made in product, technology, sales, and distribution. As of February 28, 2021, we had 112 customers comprising more than 2.1 million members. Our customers come from across industries, including media, technology, financial services, transportation, energy, and retail.\nIn July 2020, we closed our IPO of 11,526,134 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $22.00 per share, including 1,503,408 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $231.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $17.8 million and net offering expenses of approximately $4.6 million.\nIn October 2020, we closed a follow-on public offering of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $38.50 per share, including 750,000 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $208.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $12.7 million and net offering expenses of approximately $0.6 million.\nFor the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020, our total revenue was $170.4 million and $132.5 million, respectively, representing 29% year-over-year growth for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. For the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020, our net losses were $50.7 million and $51.4 million, respectively.\nOur Business Model\nWe provide our solutions primarily to employers that deploy Accolade offerings to our members. We earn revenue from providing personalized health guidance solutions to the members of our employer customers' health plans and to members of fully insured plans offered via health insurance companies. Our solutions are priced based on a recurring per-member-per-month (PMPM) fee, typically consisting of both a base fee and a performance-based fee component. As a result, generally, a portion of our potential revenue is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions. We typically achieve a substantial portion of the contractual performance metrics and realization in savings of healthcare spend.\nThe primary cost of delivering our service includes the personnel costs of Accolade Health Assistants, clinicians, including registered nurses, physician medical directors, pharmacists, behavioral health specialists, women's health specialists, and case management specialists, as well as software and tools for telephony, workforce management, business analytics, allocated overhead costs, and other expenses related to delivery and implementation of our solutions. As we support more customers with an increasing number of members over time, we expect that our support costs per member will decline due to economies of scale and improved operational efficiencies driven by continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities. We have experienced and expect to continue to achieve operational efficiencies realized from continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities.\nWe employ a multipronged go-to-market strategy to increase adoption of our solutions to new and existing customers. We principally sell our solutions through our direct salesforce which is stratified by account size (i.e., strategic (more than 35,000 employees), enterprise (5,000 to 35,000 employees), and mid-market (500 to 5,000 employees)), region, and existing versus prospective customers. Our sales team possesses deep domain expertise in health benefits management and brings substantial experience selling to key decision makers within our current and prospective customer organizations (CFOs, benefits executives, benefits consultants, and benefits brokers). We believe the effectiveness of our sales organization is evidenced by growing adoption of our platform by large strategic customers, recent traction with enterprise and mid-market customers and demonstrated demand for add-on offerings from existing customers.\nWe have chosen to invest significantly in growing our customer base, and plan to continue both adding new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers, which we believe will allow us to increase margins over time. When a customer renews their contract or purchases additional solutions or enhancements, the value realized from that customer increases because we generally do not incur significant incremental acquisition or implementation costs for the renewal or expansion. We believe that as our customer base grows and a higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals and upsells or cross-sells to existing customers, relative to acquisition of new customers, associated sales and marketing expenses and other upfront costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nIn addition, we have strategically curated our offering portfolio to ensure we have a compelling value proposition at an appropriate price point that resonates with each identified customer segment. Based on our experience, the opportunity to cross-sell is meaningfully enhanced once a customer has been on-boarded onto our platform and has benefited from a measurable and compelling return on their investment. Our customer partnerships team provides\nstrategic insights, point solution recommendations, and day-to-day account support to our customers. They are focused on existing customer retention, cross-sell, and upsell.\nWe maintain relationships with a range of third parties, including brokers, agents, benefits consultants, carriers, third-party administrators, trusted suppliers, and co-marketing and co-selling partners. These third parties provide an important source of referrals for our sales organization. We also selectively form strategic alliances to further drive customer acquisition and adoption of our solutions. For example, in March 2019, we partnered with Humana and formed a joint go-to-market strategy, which we launched in two initial geographic markets. In October 2019, concurrent with a $20 million preferred stock investment from Humana, we expanded our partnership to add a broader base of solutions targeting self- and fully-insured customer prospects and significantly expand our target geographic markets. We believe the breadth of our go-to-market and distribution strategy enables us to reach customers of nearly every size and across markets.\nWe have demonstrated a consistent track record of product and technology innovation over time as evidenced by continuous improvement of our platform and new offerings. This innovation is driven by feedback we receive from our customers, industry experts, and the market generally. For example, our technology platform has enabled us to unbundle aspects of Accolade Total Health and Benefits to create two additional standalone offerings: Accolade Total Benefits and Accolade Total Care. We have further leveraged our technology platform to develop add-on offerings that target specific challenges faced by our customers, including Accolade Boost and our Trusted Supplier Program - as well as very recently, Accolade COVID Response Care and Mental Health Integrated Care. Our investments in product and technology have been focused on increasing the value we provide via our personalized member health guidance solutions and expanding the market segments we can serve with a portfolio of offerings and associated price points.\nCOVID-19 Update\nCOVID-19 has created uncertainty for Accolade's employees, members, and customers. We consider the impact of the pandemic on our business by evaluating the health of our operations, any changes to our revenue outlook, and the degree to which perceptions of, and interest in, Accolade solutions have evolved during this unprecedented time.\nIn mid-March 2020, we closed our offices and enabled our employees to work remotely using our secure technologies to continue to meet the needs of our customers, their members, and our business. We measure our performance through several key metrics, including but not limited to customer satisfaction, member engagement, and health assistant availability. As gauged by these core performance metrics, service levels have been high, and member engagement and satisfaction have remained relatively strong. To ensure we could address our members' many COVID-19-related concerns, our operations and clinical leaders trained our frontline teams on evidence-based guidelines and continue to equip them with relevant resources to help them ably serve under these exceptional circumstances.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations to date, the future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our marketing efforts, and any decreases of workforce or benefits spending by our customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We have a diverse set of customers across a variety of industries. While some have faced headwinds, others have experienced growth, and our membership count from existing customers has remained steady in the aggregate since the start of the 2020 calendar year. However, we may experience increased member attrition to the extent our existing customers reduce their respective workforces in response to the current economic conditions. Any layoffs or reductions in employee headcounts by our employer customers would result in a reduction in our base and variable PMPM fees. In one case, a small customer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and terminated its health plan and associated Accolade services as of October 31, 2020. In addition, our airline customers have had significant headcount reductions, which have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, a reduction of revenues associated with these customers. We may not experience the impact of changes to our customers' headcounts immediately because employees that are on furlough or are receiving continued health coverage pursuant to COBRA may still have access to our services during such periods and would be included in our member count. We have also\nengaged with our airline customers to act as a partner in managing their cash needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in modified payment terms in fiscal 2021.\nWe believe our value proposition now resonates with an even broader audience of employers as they turn their focus to safely reopening their workplaces and managing the ongoing health and well-being of employees and their families. To directly address the former, we have developed Accolade COVID Response Care, a solution that allows employers of all sizes to leverage Accolade's platform to support employee education, testing, care plans, contact tracing, and return-to-work clearance. On the latter, we believe that the current disruptions to traditional care consumption have reinforced the need for navigation services, and that projected increases in healthcare costs (due to some combination of COVID-19-related testing and care, complications stemming from neglected non-COVID conditions, pent-up demand for elective services, and strain on individuals' mental health) prompt the need for solutions such as ours that bend the cost curve, and improve health outcomes, by driving good utilization up and wasteful utilization down.\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nThe following factors have been important to our business and we expect them to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods:\nGrowth of Our Customer Base\nWe believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base in our large and under-penetrated market through our sales and marketing strategy. Across our existing customer base and as we acquire new customers, we intend to expand and deepen these relationships. As we build trust through our proven model, we seek to cross-sell our add-on offerings, such as Accolade Boost, Trusted Supplier Program, COVID Response Care and Mental Health Integrated Care. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas.\nAdoption of Current and Future Solutions\nWe are constantly innovating to enhance our model and develop new offerings. Our ability to act as a trusted advisor to our members and customers positions us to identify new opportunities for additional offerings that can meet their existing and emerging needs. Our open technology platform also allows us to efficiently add new offerings and applications on top of our existing technology stack, which we have demonstrated with the recent roll-out of two new offerings, Accolade Total Benefits and Accolade Total Care, as well as our new add-on offerings, Accolade Boost, our Trusted Supplier Program, Accolade COVID Response Care, and Mental Health Integrated Care. We believe that as we expand our customer base and enter into new markets, we will be adept at identifying and deploying innovative new solutions whether developed internally or through acquisitions.\nAchievement of Performance-Based Revenue\nIn most of our contracts, a portion of our potential fee is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions and thus we might record higher revenue in some quarters compared to others. Examples of performance metrics included in our customer contracts are achievement of specified member engagement levels, member satisfaction levels, and various operational metrics. Although we have earned over 95% of the aggregate maximum potential revenue under our contracts (measured on the corresponding calendar year basis) in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, our revenue and financial results in the future may vary as a result of our ability to earn this performance-based revenue. In addition, because our customers typically pay both the base PMPM fees and variable PMPM fees in advance on a periodic basis,\nany required refund as a result of our failure to earn the performance-based revenue could have a negative impact on cash flows.\nInvestments in Technology\nSignificant investments in our technology platform have enhanced our capabilities with respect to how we engage with our members and deliver our solutions and care interventions. By leveraging our technology in areas such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and multimodal communication, we believe we can generate more efficiencies in our operating model while simultaneously improving our ability to deliver better health outcomes and lower costs for both our members and our customers. We will continue to invest in our technology platform to empower our Accolade Health Assistants, our clinicians, and our members to further improve and optimize efficiencies in our operating model. However, our investments in our technology platform may be more expensive or take longer to develop than we expect and may not result in operational efficiencies.\nCustomer Concentration\nWe have historically relied on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our total revenue. If we do not retain some or all of those customers, it could have a material negative impact on future results. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, we had three customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, and in aggregate those three customers represented 38% of our total revenue. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, we had four customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, and in aggregate those four customers represented 59% of our total revenue. The loss of any of our largest customers, the renegotiation of any of our largest customer contracts or a significant decrease in the employee headcount of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in active discussions and renegotiations with our customers in respect to the solutions we provide and the terms of our customer agreements, including our fees. Most of our customer contracts have a three-year term, and some have rights to terminate prior to the end of the term.\nKey Metrics\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance.\nTable 140: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual Contract Value (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 211.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 161.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customer Count\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 112\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Dollar Retention\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnnual Contract Value (ACV) - ACV represents the annualized value of our in-force contracts as of the measurement date, including base contractual revenue and the amount of performance-based variable revenue we expect to realize in the following fiscal year based on the number of members as of the measurement date and using a straight-line averaging of PMPM fees over the lives of the contracts. Over the past two complete fiscal years, we have realized in excess of 95% of the maximum contract value across our book of business. The ACV amounts above reflect 95% of the total revenue opportunity, consistent with the percentages realized in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 (calculated on the corresponding calendar year basis). We believe ACV provides investors with useful information on period-to-period\nperformance as evaluated by management, comparison with our past financial performance, and a view toward potential future financial performance.\nAs required by GAAP, we recognize performance-based revenue over the minimum term of the applicable contract. In some cases, especially with regard to revenue associated with the realization of healthcare cost savings, revenue may be recognized in a fiscal period later than the period in which the required metric was achieved. Conversely, a fiscal period's revenue may include the recognition of revenue related to the achievement in prior periods of performance metrics and healthcare cost savings. For purposes of calculating ACV, we assume that all customer contracts expiring during the following fiscal year will renew on the same terms.\nCustomer Count - We believe that our ability to increase our number of customers is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We have successfully demonstrated a history of growing our customer base. As of February 28, 2021, we had 112 customers. We define the number of customers as of the measurement date as the number of companies that we are currently providing services to and that we have no reason to believe such services will be terminated, or that have entered into a contract with us for which the term has not ended and for which we have no reason to believe the customer intends to terminate or not renew the contract.\nGross Dollar Retention Rate (GDR) - Our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and their associated ACV. We typically enjoy a high rate of customer retention. For example, our GDR was 99% for both of the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020. We monitor GDR specifically as it relates to our employer customers, as our employer customers represent our primary strategic focus and today account for approximately 89% of our ACV. We calculate GDR for a period by starting with the sum of the ACV from all employer customers as of the beginning of such period (beginning of period ACV); we then subtract the ACV associated with terminated employer customers during the period and divide the result by the beginning of period ACV.\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, and determine employee incentives.\nTable 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 77,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 59,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (26,939)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (33,119)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin\nAdjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, and excluding stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We expect Adjusted Gross Margin to continue to improve over time to the extent that we are able to gain efficiencies through technology and successfully cross-sell and upsell our current and future offerings. However, our ability to improve Adjusted Gross Margin over time is not guaranteed and will be impacted by the factors affecting our performance discussed above and the risks outlined in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors, as they eliminate the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of non-cash expenses and certain other nonrecurring operating expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense (net), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and acquisition and integration-related costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this measure generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations, including that they exclude the impact of certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, whereas underlying assets may need to be replaced and result in cash capital expenditures, and stock-based compensation expense, which is a recurring charge. These non-GAAP financial measures may also not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we expect to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or nonrecurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including the most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth in the reconciliation tables below and our other GAAP results. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the calculation of our Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin:\nTable 143: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 170,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 132,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (93,673)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,685)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation, cost of revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 77,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 59,140\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted Gross Margin\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020 increased to 45.0% from 44.4%, respectively, and Adjusted Gross Margin for the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020 increased to 45.6% from 44.6%, respectively. These increases were driven primarily by (i) increases in revenue associated with our offering mix and (ii) cost efficiencies realized through enhancements of our technology platform and workflows for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss:\nTable 144: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (50,652)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (51,365)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted for:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,724\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,925\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax provision\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,516\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,002\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition and integration-related costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 567\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (26,939)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (33,119)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBasis of Presentation and Components of Revenue and Expenses\nWe operate our business through a single reportable segment. We operate on a fiscal year ending at the end of February of each year, and our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30, and the last day of February.\nRevenue\nWe earn revenue from providing personalized technology-enabled solutions to the members of our employer customers' health plans and to members of fully insured plans offered via health insurance companies. Our solutions are priced based on a recurring PMPM fee and frequently include both a base PMPM fee based on eligible members and a performance-based component. As a result, a portion of our potential fee is typically variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics, the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions, and the number of eligible members during the respective period.\nCost of Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization\nOur cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, consists primarily of personnel costs including salaries, wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and benefits, as well as software and tools for telephony, workforce management, business analytics, allocated overhead costs, and other expenses related to delivery and implementation of our personalized technology-enabled solutions.\nOperating Expenses\nProduct and technology. Product and technology expenses include costs to build new offerings, add new features to our existing solutions, and to manage, operate, and ensure the reliability and scalability of our existing technology platform. Product and technology expenses consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors for our engineering, product, and design teams, and allocated overhead costs, as well as costs of software and tools for business analytics, data management, and IT applications that are not directly associated with delivery of our solutions to customers. We expect product and technology expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel expenses, including sales commissions for our direct sales force and our market and business development workforce, as well as promotional costs, customer conferences, public relations, other marketing events, and allocated overhead costs. Personnel expenses include salaries,\nbonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain stable as a percentage of revenue over time.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel expenses and related expenses for our executive, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and corporate organizations. Personnel expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. In addition, general and administrative expenses include external legal, accounting, and other professional fees, as well as software for financial and human capital management, corporate insurance costs, and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we incur increased costs associated with being a public company, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investments and consist of fixed asset depreciation, amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable

The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs to serve the customer base which grew in fiscal 2021, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, as compared to fiscal 2020.\nCost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 decreased to 55% from 56% of total revenue, respectively. This decrease was driven primarily by cost efficiencies relative to revenue realized through continuing to scale our business in fiscal 2021.\nOperating expenses\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product and technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 49,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 42,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (304)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 123,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 107,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 16,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nProduct and technology. Product and technology expense increased $7.6 million, or 18%, to $50.0 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $42.3 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel in product development and product management in support of the development of new and existing offerings in connection with the expansion of our business, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense increased $3.7 million, or 12%, to $33.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $30.1 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the size of our direct sales force, account management, marketing, and supporting functions associated with the expansion of our business, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense increased $5.4 million, or 21%, to $31.6 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $26.2 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel, preparation for our IPO, and ongoing operations as a public company after our IPO, as well as an increase in third-party consulting costs to support the expansion of our business and an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 4%, to $8.2 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $8.5 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily due to certain capitalized software becoming fully depreciated during fiscal 2021, resulting in less depreciation expense as compared to the prior period.\nInterest expense, net\nTable 152: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (3,724)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (2,925)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (799)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense, net increased $0.8 million, or 27%, to $3.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $2.9 million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflected the increase in our debt borrowings during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 along with expenses incurred in terminating our Term Loan Facility in July 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $433.9 million as of February 28, 2021. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of cash and money market accounts held at banks.\nOur Debt Arrangements\nWe had no outstanding debt as of February 28, 2021. During July 2020, we terminated our Term Loan Facility. We currently have a revolving credit facility (2019 Revolver), which we entered into in July 2019.\nThe Term Loan was a secured credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $24.5 million, with the total amount of available borrowings subject to certain monthly recurring revenue calculations. Interest on the outstanding balance was payable monthly at a rate of 8.00% per annum, plus 4.50% per annum deferred until the end of the term. The Term Loan was to mature on December 31, 2022. During July 2020, we repaid the Term Loan in full, including all outstanding interest and fees, and the Term Loan was terminated.\nThe 2019 Revolver provides for a senior secured revolving line of credit in the amount of up to $80.0 million, with borrowing availability subject to certain monthly recurring revenue calculations. The interest rate on any outstanding borrowings will be at LIBOR plus 350 basis points or the lending institution's base rate plus 250 basis points, subject to certain floors, and interest payments are to be made in installments of one, two, or three months as chosen by us. During November 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver, increasing the borrowing capacity to the maximum of $80.0 million. We also have an outstanding letter of credit to serve as an office landlord security deposit in the amount of $1.1 million. This letter of credit is secured through the revolving credit facility, thus reducing the capacity of the revolving credit facility to $78.9 million.\nDuring March 2020, we borrowed the available capacity of $48.7 to increase the Company's cash position given the uncertainty in the overall business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During July 2020, subsequent to our IPO, we repaid the 2019 Revolver in full, including all outstanding interest. The 2019 Revolver expires in July 2021 and may be automatically extended for an additional 12 months if we meet certain revenue thresholds defined under the credit agreement. The Company has achieved those revenue thresholds, and the 12-month extension shall occur upon delivery of our fiscal 2021 audited financial statements to the 2019 Revolver agent, provided that no default or event of default, as defined, shall have occurred and be continuing.\nThe 2019 Revolver contains a liquidity covenant calculated based on cash on hand plus available borrowings under the 2019 Revolver, a revenue covenant and certain reporting covenants. On August 21, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver which revised the terms of the revenue covenant and imposed minimum LIBOR and Base Rate levels. On September 11, 2020, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver which modified the allocation requirements of the Company's cash to be held at each of the two lenders participating in the 2019 Revolver. On November 6, 2020, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver which increased the capacity from $50.0 million to $80.0 million, subject to the achievement of certain milestones as defined in the amendment. On March 2, 2021, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver in association with the acquisition of 2nd.MD and amended certain covenants. On March 23, 2021, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver in association with the convertible senior notes offering.\nWe were in compliance with all such applicable covenants as of February 28, 2021, and believe we are in compliance as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not expect to need to draw on the 2019 Revolver, but our access to draw on the 2019 Revolver could be limited in the future if we do not have enough monthly recurring revenues to cover the borrowing availability calculations.\nOn March 29, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $287.5 million principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d), including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, pursuant to an Indenture dated as of March 29, 2021 (the Indenture\u201d), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (25,232)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> (34,247)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,423)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,521)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 428,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,222\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased by $9.0 million to $25.2 million during fiscal 2021 from $34.2 million during fiscal 2020, primarily related to a change in accrued compensation and other assets partially offset by changes in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. The change in accrued compensation is primarily due to the settlement of our annual bonuses related to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 through the issuance of fully vested stock options in lieu of cash payments in June 2020. The change in other assets is primarily due to the receipt of receivables related to an employee withholding tax associated with the exercise of stock and the reclassification of offering costs related to our IPO to additional paid-in capital. The change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable at February 28, 2021 due to the modification of payment terms with our airline customers, as well as the increase in accounts receivable related to an increase in the number of customers at February 28, 2021 as compared to February 29, 2020.\nInvesting Activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $1.1 million to $2.4 million during fiscal 2021 from $3.5 million during fiscal 2020, primarily due to a decrease in property and equipment purchases during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020.\nFinancing Activities.\nOur cash flows from financing activities amounted to $428.4 million during fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting the net cash proceeds of $439.5 million as a result of our IPO and follow-on offering and proceeds from debt borrowings of $51.2 million, partially offset by debt repayments of $73.2 million.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of February 28, 2021:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,969\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees on revolving credit facility(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data license in connection with joint development agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 950\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Includes the lease of our (a) corporate co-headquarters in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, which expires in June 2027, subject to certain early termination rights, (b) corporate co-headquarters in Seattle, Washington, which expires in September 2030, subject to certain early termination rights, (c) office space in Scottsdale, Arizona, which expires </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 156: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>in April 2024, subject to certain early termination rights, (d) office space in Prague, Czech Republic, which expires in November 2021, and (e) office space in Santa Monica, California, which expires in February 2023. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table><tr><td>(2) </td> <td>The Company met certain revenue thresholds defined under the 2019 Revolver credit agreement which will result in a 12-month extension through July 2022 upon delivery of the audited financial statements to the 2019 Revolver agent, provided that no default or event of default, as defined, shall have occurred and be continuing. Additional fees will be incurred through that date. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe did not have any other contractual obligations, except as discussed above.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes. We did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements, except to the extent reflected under - Contractual Obligations\u201d above and in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe earn revenue from our customers by providing personalized health guidance solutions to members. Our solutions allow members to interact with our Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians through various means of communication, including telephony and secure messaging via our mobile application and member web portal. We price our personalized health guidance solutions using a recurring PMPM fee, typically with a portion of the fee calculated as the product of a fixed rate times the number of eligible members (fixed PMPM fee), plus a variable PMPM fee calculated as the product of a variable rate times the number of eligible members (variable PMPM fee). The fees associated with the variable PMPM fee can be earned through the achievement of performance metrics and/or the realization of healthcare cost savings resulting from the utilization of our services. In addition, our revenue is dependent on the number of members each month and the timing of revenue recognition discussed under Key Metrics - Annual Contract Value.\u201d As a result, we may report higher revenue in certain quarters relative to others. While we believe we have visibility into the seasonality of our business on a customer-by-customer basis, our rapid growth over the periods discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may have made seasonal fluctuations more difficult to detect. If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and the comparability of our results of operations between periods may be materially affected.\nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. Accordingly, we determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>identification of the performance obligations in the contract; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 160: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>determination of the transaction price; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt contract inception, we assess the type of services being provided and assess the performance obligations in the contract. Our contracts for personalized health guidance solutions include stand ready services and reporting performance obligations. Our contracts include stand ready services to provide eligible participants with access to our services and to perform an unspecified quantity of interactions with members during the contract period. Accordingly, our services are generally viewed as stand ready performance obligations comprised of a series of distinct daily services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. For the stand ready services, we satisfy these performance obligations over time and recognize revenue related to our services as the services are provided using a measure of progress based upon the actual number of members eligible for the service during the respective period as a percentage of the estimated members expected to be eligible for the service over the term of the contract.\nWe include consideration for our revenue related to the achievement of performance metrics and the realization of healthcare cost savings when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur. We estimate revenue using the most likely amount that we will receive. Estimates are based on our historical experience and best judgment at the time. Our estimates related to variable consideration are updated quarterly, and the total transaction price and revenue recognized are adjusted accordingly.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nSome of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. We account for performance obligations separately if they are capable of being distinct within the context of the contract. In these circumstances, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors.\nSpecifically, some contracts contain an additional performance obligation, pre-launch open enrollment, for which the performance obligation is satisfied before the launch of our primary offering. For contracts that include pre-launch open enrollment support, we recognize related revenue over the pre-launch open enrollment period based on the number of eligible participants.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, the most critical of which, prior to our IPO, was the estimated fair value of common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The resulting fair value, net of actual forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\nTable 163: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Expected volatility. Since a public market for our common stock did not exist prior to our IPO in July 2020 and, therefore, we do not have an extensive trading history of our common stock, we estimated the expected volatility based on the volatility of similar publicly-held entities (guideline companies) over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. In evaluating the similarity of guideline companies to us, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar guideline companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our common stock becomes available. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Expected term. We estimate the expected term using the simplified method, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise activity to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method calculates the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding as the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for maturities corresponding with the expected term of the option. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any dividends and do not presently plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe are required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards when performing fair value calculations.\nHistorically for all periods prior to our IPO, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, we exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:\nTable 167: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>contemporaneous valuations performed at periodic intervals by unrelated third-party specialists; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our actual operating and financial performance; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>relevant precedent transactions involving our capital stock; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company given prevailing market conditions and the nature and history of our business; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>market multiples of comparable companies in our industry; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>stage of development; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>industry information such as market size and growth; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>macroeconomic conditions. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our IPO, our board of directors determined the enterprise value of our company using both the income approach and market approach valuation methods. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on the cost of capital at a company's stage of development. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company's financial results to estimate the enterprise value of the subject company.\nThe resulting equity values derived by the income approach and market approach were then allocated between share classes by a hybrid of the Probability Weighted Expected Return Method (PWERM) and the Option Pricing Method (OPM). The hybrid method was selected to consider various outcomes for our company including an initial public offering or continuing as a private company. The values of the share classes under an initial public offering scenario were based on the expected pricing and timing of the anticipated event according to the PWERM. Conversely, the OPM was used to estimate the value of the share classes assuming we stayed private.\nThe PWERM estimates the value of the various equity classes based upon analysis of the future value for the enterprise under different potential outcomes including sale, merger, IPO, and dissolution. For each scenario, the value determined for the enterprise is allocated to each class of stock based upon the assumption that each class will maximize its value. The values determined for each class of stock under each scenario are weighted by the probability of each scenario and then discounted to a present value.\nThe OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the enterprise's value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution exceed the value of liquidation preference at the time of a liquidity event. If the total equity value exceeds the total liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock, the preferred stock will receive a payout in cash in the case of a liquidation event or in common stock in the case of an IPO, and the preferred stock will then convert to common stock. Any incremental value above the total liquidation preference would be shared based on the converted ownership interests.\nIn the application of this method, the convertible features of the preferred equity classes, common options and warrants outstanding are considered.\nAfter the equity value is determined and allocated to the various classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) is applied to the various outcomes to arrive at the fair value of the common stock. A DLOM is applied based on the theory that as a private company, an owner of the stock has limited opportunities to sell this stock and any such sale would involve significant transaction costs, thereby reducing overall fair market value.\nApplication of these valuation approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock.\nFollowing our IPO, our board of directors relies on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant to determine the fair value of our common stock.\nAccounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of February 28, 2021, we had $4.0 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. For the purposes of impairment testing, we have determined that we have one reporting unit. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If that is the case, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the asset may be impaired. In performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting unit, anticipated changes in industry and market structure, and the competitive and regulatory environment. No indicators of impairment were identified during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 that required us to perform an interim assessment or recoverability test.\nRealizability of Long-Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, quarterly, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets.\nWe assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.\nIn addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\nWe will continue to evaluate the values of our long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nFor more information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEmerging Growth Company Status\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) February 28, 2026 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO), (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (iii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d, as defined in the rules under the Exchange Act, and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 herein as the JOBS Act,\u201d and any reference herein to emerging growth company\u201d has the meaning ascribed to it in the JOBS Act.\nWe have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different from the information you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. In particular, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) for complying with new or revised accounting\nstandards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing of new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies until these standards apply to private companies unless we elect to early adopt as permitted by the relevant guidance for private companies.", "item_7_truncated": " \u25cf Risk-free interest rate.

For the stand ready services, we satisfy these performance obligations over time and recognize revenue related to our services as the services are provided using a measure of progress based upon the actual number of members eligible for the service during the respective period as a percentage of the estimated members expected to be eligible for the service over the term of the contract.\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance.\nTable 151: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Changes\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Product and technology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 49,955\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 42,306\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 7,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,050\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (304)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 123,462\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 107,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 16,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets.

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased by $9.0 million to $25.2 million during fiscal 2021 from $34.2 million during fiscal 2020, primarily related to a change in accrued compensation and other assets partially offset by changes in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. The change in accrued compensation is primarily due to the settlement of our annual bonuses related to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 through the issuance of fully vested stock options in lieu of cash payments in June 2020. The change in other assets is primarily due to the receipt of receivables related to an employee withholding tax associated with the exercise of stock and the reclassification of offering costs related to our IPO to additional paid-in capital. The change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable at February 28, 2021 due to the modification of payment terms with our airline customers, as well as the increase in accounts receivable related to an increase in the number of customers at February 28, 2021 as compared to February 29, 2020.\nTable 141: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>February 28(29),\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Dollar Retention\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 99\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn October 2020, we closed a follow-on public offering of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $38.50 per share, including 750,000 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $208.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $12.7 million and net offering expenses of approximately $0.6 million.\nWe had no outstanding debt as of February 28, 2021.

We have successfully demonstrated a history of growing our customer base. As of February 28, 2021, we had 112 customers. We define the number of customers as of the measurement date as the number of companies that we are currently providing services to and that we have no reason to believe such services will be terminated, or that have entered into a contract with us for which the term has not ended and for which we have no reason to believe the customer intends to terminate or not renew the contract.\nApplication of these valuation approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $1.1 million to $2.4 million during fiscal 2021 from $3.5 million during fiscal 2020, primarily due to a decrease in property and equipment purchases during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020.\nTable 154: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 2 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years 4 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 6,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 13,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 11,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 15,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 46,969\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees on revolving credit facility(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data license in connection with joint development agreement\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 475\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 950\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nSome of our contracts include multiple performance obligations.

Personnel expenses include salaries,\nWe have chosen to invest significantly in growing our customer base, and plan to continue both adding new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers, which we believe will allow us to increase margins over time. When a customer renews their contract or purchases additional solutions or enhancements, the value realized from that customer increases because we generally do not incur significant incremental acquisition or implementation costs for the renewal or expansion. We believe that as our customer base grows and a higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals and upsells or cross-sells to existing customers, relative to acquisition of new customers, associated sales and marketing expenses and other upfront costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If that is the case, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the asset may be impaired. In performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting unit, anticipated changes in industry and market structure, and the competitive and regulatory environment. No indicators of impairment were identified during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 that required us to perform an interim assessment or recoverability test.\nAnnual Contract Value (ACV) - ACV represents the annualized value of our in-force contracts as of the measurement date, including base contractual revenue and the amount of performance-based variable revenue we expect to realize in the following fiscal year based on the number of members as of the measurement date and using a straight-line averaging of PMPM fees over the lives of the contracts. Over the past two complete fiscal years, we have realized in excess of 95% of the maximum contract value across our book of business. The ACV amounts above reflect 95% of the total revenue opportunity, consistent with the percentages realized in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 (calculated on the corresponding calendar year basis). We believe ACV provides investors with useful information on period-to-period\n\nCOVID-19 Update\n\n\nFor more information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our IPO, our board of directors determined the enterprise value of our company using both the income approach and market approach valuation methods. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on the cost of capital at a company's stage of development. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company's financial results to estimate the enterprise value of the subject company.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur Business Model\nThe following factors have been important to our business and we expect them to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods:\nRealizability of Long-Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, quarterly, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets.\n \u25cf market multiples of comparable companies in our industry; \nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense increased $5.4 million, or 21%, to $31.6 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $26.2 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel, preparation for our IPO, and ongoing operations as a public company after our IPO, as well as an increase in third-party consulting costs to support the expansion of our business and an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nBasis of Presentation and Components of Revenue and Expenses\nGrowth of Our Customer Base\n \u25cf recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. \nWe are constantly innovating to enhance our model and develop new offerings. Our ability to act as a trusted advisor to our members and customers positions us to identify new opportunities for additional offerings that can meet their existing and emerging needs. Our open technology platform also allows us to efficiently add new offerings and applications on top of our existing technology stack, which we have demonstrated with the recent roll-out of two new offerings, Accolade Total Benefits and Accolade Total Care, as well as our new add-on offerings, Accolade Boost, our Trusted Supplier Program, Accolade COVID Response Care, and Mental Health Integrated Care. We believe that as we expand our customer base and enter into new markets, we will be adept at identifying and deploying innovative new solutions whether developed internally or through acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities.\nHistorically for all periods prior to our IPO, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, we exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:\nWe have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different from the information you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. In particular, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) for complying with new or revised accounting\nAdoption of Current and Future Solutions\n\n\n \u25cf rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; \n \u25cf industry information such as market size and growth; \nWe have historically relied on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our total revenue. If we do not retain some or all of those customers, it could have a material negative impact on future results. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, we had three customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, and in aggregate those three customers represented 38% of our total revenue. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, we had four customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, and in aggregate those four customers represented 59% of our total revenue. The loss of any of our largest customers, the renegotiation of any of our largest customer contracts or a significant decrease in the employee headcount of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in active discussions and renegotiations with our customers in respect to the solutions we provide and the terms of our customer agreements, including our fees. Most of our customer contracts have a three-year term, and some have rights to terminate prior to the end of the term.\nCash Flows\nFollowing our IPO, our board of directors relies on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant to determine the fair value of our common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDiscussion and analysis of our fiscal year 2019, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2020 financial performance to 2019, have been omitted from this section and may be found under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the Final Prospectus for our initial public offering (our IPO) dated as of July 1, 2020 and files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on July 2, 2020. Our fiscal year ends on the last day of February, and our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30, and the last day of February.\n (1) Includes the lease of our (a) corporate co-headquarters in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, which expires in June 2027, subject to certain early termination rights, (b) corporate co-headquarters in Seattle, Washington, which expires in September 2030, subject to certain early termination rights, (c) office space in Scottsdale, Arizona, which expires \nProduct and technology. Product and technology expense increased $7.6 million, or 18%, to $50.0 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $42.3 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel in product development and product management in support of the development of new and existing offerings in connection with the expansion of our business, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) February 28, 2026 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO), (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (iii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d, as defined in the rules under the Exchange Act, and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 herein as the JOBS Act,\u201d and any reference herein to emerging growth company\u201d has the meaning ascribed to it in the JOBS Act.\n\nperformance as evaluated by management, comparison with our past financial performance, and a view toward potential future financial performance.\nWe have demonstrated a consistent track record of product and technology innovation over time as evidenced by continuous improvement of our platform and new offerings. This innovation is driven by feedback we receive from our customers, industry experts, and the market generally. For example, our technology platform has enabled us to unbundle aspects of Accolade Total Health and Benefits to create two additional standalone offerings: Accolade Total Benefits and Accolade Total Care. We have further leveraged our technology platform to develop add-on offerings that target specific challenges faced by our customers, including Accolade Boost and our Trusted Supplier Program - as well as very recently, Accolade COVID Response Care and Mental Health Integrated Care. Our investments in product and technology have been focused on increasing the value we provide via our personalized member health guidance solutions and expanding the market segments we can serve with a portfolio of offerings and associated price points.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n \u25cf our actual operating and financial performance; \n\nEmerging Growth Company Status\n \u25cf identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; \nIn addition, we have strategically curated our offering portfolio to ensure we have a compelling value proposition at an appropriate price point that resonates with each identified customer segment. Based on our experience, the opportunity to cross-sell is meaningfully enhanced once a customer has been on-boarded onto our platform and has benefited from a measurable and compelling return on their investment. Our customer partnerships team provides\n \u25cf determination of the transaction price; \nThe Term Loan was a secured credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $24.5 million, with the total amount of available borrowings subject to certain monthly recurring revenue calculations. Interest on the outstanding balance was payable monthly at a rate of 8.00% per annum, plus 4.50% per annum deferred until the end of the term. The Term Loan was to mature on December 31, 2022. During July 2020, we repaid the Term Loan in full, including all outstanding interest and fees, and the Term Loan was terminated.\nWe provide personalized, technology-enabled solutions that help people better understand, navigate, and utilize the healthcare system and their workplace benefits. Our customers are primarily employers that deploy Accolade in order to provide employees and their families (our members\u201d) a single place to turn for their health, healthcare, and benefits needs. Our innovative platform combines open, cloud-based intelligent technology with multimodal support from a team of empathetic and knowledgeable Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians (including nurses, physician medical directors, and behavioral health specialists). We leverage our integrated capabilities, connectivity with providers and the broader healthcare ecosystem, and longitudinal data to engage across the entire member population, rather than focusing solely on high-cost claimants or those with chronic conditions. Our goal is to build trusted relationships with our members that ultimately position us to deliver personalized recommendations and interventions. We believe that our platform dramatically improves the member experience, encourages better health outcomes, and lowers costs for both our members and our customers.\nCustomer Concentration\nInterest expense, net\n \u25cf likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company given prevailing market conditions and the nature and history of our business; \nWe assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.\n\nKey Metrics\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investments and consist of fixed asset depreciation, amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs.\nOperating expenses\nAs required by GAAP, we recognize performance-based revenue over the minimum term of the applicable contract. In some cases, especially with regard to revenue associated with the realization of healthcare cost savings, revenue may be recognized in a fiscal period later than the period in which the required metric was achieved. Conversely, a fiscal period's revenue may include the recognition of revenue related to the achievement in prior periods of performance metrics and healthcare cost savings. For purposes of calculating ACV, we assume that all customer contracts expiring during the following fiscal year will renew on the same terms.\nCost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense (net), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and acquisition and integration-related costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this measure generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, the most critical of which, prior to our IPO, was the estimated fair value of common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The resulting fair value, net of actual forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nRevenue\nAfter the equity value is determined and allocated to the various classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) is applied to the various outcomes to arrive at the fair value of the common stock. A DLOM is applied based on the theory that as a private company, an owner of the stock has limited opportunities to sell this stock and any such sale would involve significant transaction costs, thereby reducing overall fair market value.\nWe provide our solutions primarily to employers that deploy Accolade offerings to our members. We earn revenue from providing personalized health guidance solutions to the members of our employer customers' health plans and to members of fully insured plans offered via health insurance companies. Our solutions are priced based on a recurring per-member-per-month (PMPM) fee, typically consisting of both a base fee and a performance-based fee component. As a result, generally, a portion of our potential revenue is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions. We typically achieve a substantial portion of the contractual performance metrics and realization in savings of healthcare spend.\n \u25cf allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u25cf macroeconomic conditions. \nResults of Operations\nDuring March 2020, we borrowed the available capacity of $48.7 to increase the Company's cash position given the uncertainty in the overall business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During July 2020, subsequent to our IPO, we repaid the 2019 Revolver in full, including all outstanding interest. The 2019 Revolver expires in July 2021 and may be automatically extended for an additional 12 months if we meet certain revenue thresholds defined under the credit agreement. The Company has achieved those revenue thresholds, and the 12-month extension shall occur upon delivery of our fiscal 2021 audited financial statements to the 2019 Revolver agent, provided that no default or event of default, as defined, shall have occurred and be continuing.\nWe employ a multipronged go-to-market strategy to increase adoption of our solutions to new and existing customers. We principally sell our solutions through our direct salesforce which is stratified by account size (i.e., strategic (more than 35,000 employees), enterprise (5,000 to 35,000 employees), and mid-market (500 to 5,000 employees)), region, and existing versus prospective customers. Our sales team possesses deep domain expertise in health benefits management and brings substantial experience selling to key decision makers within our current and prospective customer organizations (CFOs, benefits executives, benefits consultants, and benefits brokers). We believe the effectiveness of our sales organization is evidenced by growing adoption of our platform by large strategic customers, recent traction with enterprise and mid-market customers and demonstrated demand for add-on offerings from existing customers.\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n \u25cf relevant precedent transactions involving our capital stock; \nbonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain stable as a percentage of revenue over time.\nSignificant investments in our technology platform have enhanced our capabilities with respect to how we engage with our members and deliver our solutions and care interventions. By leveraging our technology in areas such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and multimodal communication, we believe we can generate more efficiencies in our operating model while simultaneously improving our ability to deliver better health outcomes and lower costs for both our members and our customers. We will continue to invest in our technology platform to empower our Accolade Health Assistants, our clinicians, and our members to further improve and optimize efficiencies in our operating model. However, our investments in our technology platform may be more expensive or take longer to develop than we expect and may not result in operational efficiencies.\nAdjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, and excluding stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We expect Adjusted Gross Margin to continue to improve over time to the extent that we are able to gain efficiencies through technology and successfully cross-sell and upsell our current and future offerings. However, our ability to improve Adjusted Gross Margin over time is not guaranteed and will be impacted by the factors affecting our performance discussed above and the risks outlined in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors, as they eliminate the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of non-cash expenses and certain other nonrecurring operating expenses.\nWe were founded in 2007 and launched our initial offering in 2009. We have seen significant growth in recent years since the changes to our executive management team in 2015 and the subsequent investments we have made in product, technology, sales, and distribution. As of February 28, 2021, we had 112 customers comprising more than 2.1 million members. Our customers come from across industries, including media, technology, financial services, transportation, energy, and retail.\nWe are required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards when performing fair value calculations.\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel expenses and related expenses for our executive, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and corporate organizations. Personnel expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. In addition, general and administrative expenses include external legal, accounting, and other professional fees, as well as software for financial and human capital management, corporate insurance costs, and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we incur increased costs associated with being a public company, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\n in April 2024, subject to certain early termination rights, (d) office space in Prague, Czech Republic, which expires in November 2021, and (e) office space in Santa Monica, California, which expires in February 2023. \nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\n \u25cf illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company; and \nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, and determine employee incentives.\nCost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 decreased to 55% from 56% of total revenue, respectively. This decrease was driven primarily by cost efficiencies relative to revenue realized through continuing to scale our business in fiscal 2021.\nCost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization increased $20.0 million, or 27%, to $93.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $73.7 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs to serve the customer base which grew in fiscal 2021, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, as compared to fiscal 2020.\nInvesting Activities.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of February 28, 2021:\nThe PWERM estimates the value of the various equity classes based upon analysis of the future value for the enterprise under different potential outcomes including sale, merger, IPO, and dissolution. For each scenario, the value determined for the enterprise is allocated to each class of stock based upon the assumption that each class will maximize its value. The values determined for each class of stock under each scenario are weighted by the probability of each scenario and then discounted to a present value.\nThe 2019 Revolver contains a liquidity covenant calculated based on cash on hand plus available borrowings under the 2019 Revolver, a revenue covenant and certain reporting covenants. On August 21, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver which revised the terms of the revenue covenant and imposed minimum LIBOR and Base Rate levels. On September 11, 2020, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver which modified the allocation requirements of the Company's cash to be held at each of the two lenders participating in the 2019 Revolver. On November 6, 2020, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver which increased the capacity from $50.0 million to $80.0 million, subject to the achievement of certain milestones as defined in the amendment. On March 2, 2021, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver in association with the acquisition of 2nd.MD and amended certain covenants. On March 23, 2021, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver in association with the convertible senior notes offering.\nIn mid-March 2020, we closed our offices and enabled our employees to work remotely using our secure technologies to continue to meet the needs of our customers, their members, and our business. We measure our performance through several key metrics, including but not limited to customer satisfaction, member engagement, and health assistant availability. As gauged by these core performance metrics, service levels have been high, and member engagement and satisfaction have remained relatively strong. To ensure we could address our members' many COVID-19-related concerns, our operations and clinical leaders trained our frontline teams on evidence-based guidelines and continue to equip them with relevant resources to help them ably serve under these exceptional circumstances.\nGross Dollar Retention Rate (GDR) - Our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and their associated ACV. We typically enjoy a high rate of customer retention. For example, our GDR was 99% for both of the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020. We monitor GDR specifically as it relates to our employer customers, as our employer customers represent our primary strategic focus and today account for approximately 89% of our ACV. We calculate GDR for a period by starting with the sum of the ACV from all employer customers as of the beginning of such period (beginning of period ACV); we then subtract the ACV associated with terminated employer customers during the period and divide the result by the beginning of period ACV.\n \u25cf Expected term. We estimate the expected term using the simplified method, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise activity to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method calculates the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding as the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award. \nWe include consideration for our revenue related to the achievement of performance metrics and the realization of healthcare cost savings when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur. We estimate revenue using the most likely amount that we will receive. Estimates are based on our historical experience and best judgment at the time. Our estimates related to variable consideration are updated quarterly, and the total transaction price and revenue recognized are adjusted accordingly.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 4%, to $8.2 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $8.5 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily due to certain capitalized software becoming fully depreciated during fiscal 2021, resulting in less depreciation expense as compared to the prior period.\nOperating Expenses\n \u25cf stage of development; \nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. Accordingly, we determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe maintain relationships with a range of third parties, including brokers, agents, benefits consultants, carriers, third-party administrators, trusted suppliers, and co-marketing and co-selling partners. These third parties provide an important source of referrals for our sales organization. We also selectively form strategic alliances to further drive customer acquisition and adoption of our solutions. For example, in March 2019, we partnered with Humana and formed a joint go-to-market strategy, which we launched in two initial geographic markets. In October 2019, concurrent with a $20 million preferred stock investment from Humana, we expanded our partnership to add a broader base of solutions targeting self- and fully-insured customer prospects and significantly expand our target geographic markets. We believe the breadth of our go-to-market and distribution strategy enables us to reach customers of nearly every size and across markets.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Debt Arrangements\nThe resulting equity values derived by the income approach and market approach were then allocated between share classes by a hybrid of the Probability Weighted Expected Return Method (PWERM) and the Option Pricing Method (OPM). The hybrid method was selected to consider various outcomes for our company including an initial public offering or continuing as a private company. The values of the share classes under an initial public offering scenario were based on the expected pricing and timing of the anticipated event according to the PWERM. Conversely, the OPM was used to estimate the value of the share classes assuming we stayed private.\nIn most of our contracts, a portion of our potential fee is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions and thus we might record higher revenue in some quarters compared to others. Examples of performance metrics included in our customer contracts are achievement of specified member engagement levels, member satisfaction levels, and various operational metrics. Although we have earned over 95% of the aggregate maximum potential revenue under our contracts (measured on the corresponding calendar year basis) in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, our revenue and financial results in the future may vary as a result of our ability to earn this performance-based revenue. In addition, because our customers typically pay both the base PMPM fees and variable PMPM fees in advance on a periodic basis,\n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operation data expressed as a percentage of revenue:\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense increased $3.7 million, or 12%, to $33.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $30.1 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the size of our direct sales force, account management, marketing, and supporting functions associated with the expansion of our business, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nAccolade Total Health and Benefits is our most comprehensive offering and most closely aligns to our Premier\u201d solution on which the company was founded and from which the majority of our revenues are derived today. Our technology platform has enabled us to unbundle aspects of this comprehensive offering to create two additional standalone offerings: Accolade Total Benefits (focused on member benefits engagement) and Accolade Total Care (focused on guiding members to high-quality, cost-effective providers). We have further leveraged our technology platform to develop add-on offerings, such as Accolade Boost, our Trusted Supplier Program, Accolade COVID Response Care, and Mental Health Integrated Care that target specific challenges faced by our customers. Through our acquisition of Innovation Specialists, LLC d/b/a 2nd.MD (2nd.MD) we also acquired the capability to provide an expert medical consultation and medical decision support service, which may be provided as a standalone service or with elements incorporated into our core offerings.\nany required refund as a result of our failure to earn the performance-based revenue could have a negative impact on cash flows.\nAchievement of Performance-Based Revenue\nInvestments in Technology\nFor the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020, our total revenue was $170.4 million and $132.5 million, respectively, representing 29% year-over-year growth for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. For the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020, our net losses were $50.7 million and $51.4 million, respectively.\nGross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020 increased to 45.0% from 44.4%, respectively, and Adjusted Gross Margin for the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020 increased to 45.6% from 44.6%, respectively. These increases were driven primarily by (i) increases in revenue associated with our offering mix and (ii) cost efficiencies realized through enhancements of our technology platform and workflows for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nstrategic insights, point solution recommendations, and day-to-day account support to our customers. They are focused on existing customer retention, cross-sell, and upsell.\nWe earn revenue from our customers by providing personalized health guidance solutions to members. Our solutions allow members to interact with our Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians through various means of communication, including telephony and secure messaging via our mobile application and member web portal. We price our personalized health guidance solutions using a recurring PMPM fee, typically with a portion of the fee calculated as the product of a fixed rate times the number of eligible members (fixed PMPM fee), plus a variable PMPM fee calculated as the product of a variable rate times the number of eligible members (variable PMPM fee). The fees associated with the variable PMPM fee can be earned through the achievement of performance metrics and/or the realization of healthcare cost savings resulting from the utilization of our services. In addition, our revenue is dependent on the number of members each month and the timing of revenue recognition discussed under Key Metrics - Annual Contract Value.\u201d As a result, we may report higher revenue in certain quarters relative to others. While we believe we have visibility into the seasonality of our business on a customer-by-customer basis, our rapid growth over the periods discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may have made seasonal fluctuations more difficult to detect. If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and the comparability of our results of operations between periods may be materially affected.\nRevenue\nThe OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the enterprise's value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution exceed the value of liquidation preference at the time of a liquidity event. If the total equity value exceeds the total liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock, the preferred stock will receive a payout in cash in the case of a liquidation event or in common stock in the case of an IPO, and the preferred stock will then convert to common stock. Any incremental value above the total liquidation preference would be shared based on the converted ownership interests.\nThe 2019 Revolver provides for a senior secured revolving line of credit in the amount of up to $80.0 million, with borrowing availability subject to certain monthly recurring revenue calculations. The interest rate on any outstanding borrowings will be at LIBOR plus 350 basis points or the lending institution's base rate plus 250 basis points, subject to certain floors, and interest payments are to be made in installments of one, two, or three months as chosen by us. During November 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver, increasing the borrowing capacity to the maximum of $80.0 million. We also have an outstanding letter of credit to serve as an office landlord security deposit in the amount of $1.1 million. This letter of credit is secured through the revolving credit facility, thus reducing the capacity of the revolving credit facility to $78.9 million.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations, including that they exclude the impact of certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, whereas underlying assets may need to be replaced and result in cash capital expenditures, and stock-based compensation expense, which is a recurring charge. These non-GAAP financial measures may also not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we expect to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or nonrecurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including the most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth in the reconciliation tables below and our other GAAP results. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the calculation of our Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin:\n\nWe did not have any other contractual obligations, except as discussed above.\nOverview\nIn the application of this method, the convertible features of the preferred equity classes, common options and warrants outstanding are considered.\nProduct and technology. Product and technology expenses include costs to build new offerings, add new features to our existing solutions, and to manage, operate, and ensure the reliability and scalability of our existing technology platform. Product and technology expenses consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors for our engineering, product, and design teams, and allocated overhead costs, as well as costs of software and tools for business analytics, data management, and IT applications that are not directly associated with delivery of our solutions to customers. We expect product and technology expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\n \u25cf contemporaneous valuations performed at periodic intervals by unrelated third-party specialists; \nWe believe our value proposition now resonates with an even broader audience of employers as they turn their focus to safely reopening their workplaces and managing the ongoing health and well-being of employees and their families. To directly address the former, we have developed Accolade COVID Response Care, a solution that allows employers of all sizes to leverage Accolade's platform to support employee education, testing, care plans, contact tracing, and return-to-work clearance. On the latter, we believe that the current disruptions to traditional care consumption have reinforced the need for navigation services, and that projected increases in healthcare costs (due to some combination of COVID-19-related testing and care, complications stemming from neglected non-COVID conditions, pent-up demand for elective services, and strain on individuals' mental health) prompt the need for solutions such as ours that bend the cost curve, and improve health outcomes, by driving good utilization up and wasteful utilization down.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations to date, the future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our marketing efforts, and any decreases of workforce or benefits spending by our customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We have a diverse set of customers across a variety of industries. While some have faced headwinds, others have experienced growth, and our membership count from existing customers has remained steady in the aggregate since the start of the 2020 calendar year. However, we may experience increased member attrition to the extent our existing customers reduce their respective workforces in response to the current economic conditions. Any layoffs or reductions in employee headcounts by our employer customers would result in a reduction in our base and variable PMPM fees. In one case, a small customer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and terminated its health plan and associated Accolade services as of October 31, 2020. In addition, our airline customers have had significant headcount reductions, which have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, a reduction of revenues associated with these customers. We may not experience the impact of changes to our customers' headcounts immediately because employees that are on furlough or are receiving continued health coverage pursuant to COBRA may still have access to our services during such periods and would be included in our member count. We have also\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nWe will continue to evaluate the values of our long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss:\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nengaged with our airline customers to act as a partner in managing their cash needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in modified payment terms in fiscal 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInterest expense, net increased $0.8 million, or 27%, to $3.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $2.9 million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflected the increase in our debt borrowings during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 along with expenses incurred in terminating our Term Loan Facility in July 2020.\n \u25cf Expected volatility. Since a public market for our common stock did not exist prior to our IPO in July 2020 and, therefore, we do not have an extensive trading history of our common stock, we estimated the expected volatility based on the volatility of similar publicly-held entities (guideline companies) over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. In evaluating the similarity of guideline companies to us, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar guideline companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our common stock becomes available. \nAccounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nSpecifically, some contracts contain an additional performance obligation, pre-launch open enrollment, for which the performance obligation is satisfied before the launch of our primary offering. For contracts that include pre-launch open enrollment support, we recognize related revenue over the pre-launch open enrollment period based on the number of eligible participants.\nThe primary cost of delivering our service includes the personnel costs of Accolade Health Assistants, clinicians, including registered nurses, physician medical directors, pharmacists, behavioral health specialists, women's health specialists, and case management specialists, as well as software and tools for telephony, workforce management, business analytics, allocated overhead costs, and other expenses related to delivery and implementation of our solutions. As we support more customers with an increasing number of members over time, we expect that our support costs per member will decline due to economies of scale and improved operational efficiencies driven by continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities. We have experienced and expect to continue to achieve operational efficiencies realized from continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities.\n \u25cf Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any dividends and do not presently plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. \n (2) The Company met certain revenue thresholds defined under the 2019 Revolver credit agreement which will result in a 12-month extension through July 2022 upon delivery of the audited financial statements to the 2019 Revolver agent, provided that no default or event of default, as defined, shall have occurred and be continuing. Additional fees will be incurred through that date. \nCost of Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization", "item_7_text": " \u25cf Risk-free interest rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for maturities corresponding with the expected term of the option. \nWe were in compliance with all such applicable covenants as of February 28, 2021, and believe we are in compliance as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We do not expect to need to draw on the 2019 Revolver, but our access to draw on the 2019 Revolver could be limited in the future if we do not have enough monthly recurring revenues to cover the borrowing availability calculations.\nCOVID-19 has created uncertainty for Accolade's employees, members, and customers. We consider the impact of the pandemic on our business by evaluating the health of our operations, any changes to our revenue outlook, and the degree to which perceptions of, and interest in, Accolade solutions have evolved during this unprecedented time.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements, including the related notes thereto, appearing at the end of this filing. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ significantly from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause future results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, those discussed in the sections titled Risk Factors\u201d and Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, consists primarily of personnel costs including salaries, wages, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense and benefits, as well as software and tools for telephony, workforce management, business analytics, allocated overhead costs, and other expenses related to delivery and implementation of our personalized technology-enabled solutions.\n\nIn July 2020, we closed our IPO of 11,526,134 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $22.00 per share, including 1,503,408 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $231.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $17.8 million and net offering expenses of approximately $4.6 million.\nAt contract inception, we assess the type of services being provided and assess the performance obligations in the contract. Our contracts for personalized health guidance solutions include stand ready services and reporting performance obligations. Our contracts include stand ready services to provide eligible participants with access to our services and to perform an unspecified quantity of interactions with members during the contract period. Accordingly, our services are generally viewed as stand ready performance obligations comprised of a series of distinct daily services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer. For the stand ready services, we satisfy these performance obligations over time and recognize revenue related to our services as the services are provided using a measure of progress based upon the actual number of members eligible for the service during the respective period as a percentage of the estimated members expected to be eligible for the service over the term of the contract.\nWe regularly monitor a number of financial and operating metrics in order to measure our current performance and estimate our future performance.\nIn addition to our recoverability assessments, we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long-lived assets. Any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made, as well as in subsequent quarters.\n \u25cf identification of the performance obligations in the contract; \nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses, as well as related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nNet cash used in operating activities decreased by $9.0 million to $25.2 million during fiscal 2021 from $34.2 million during fiscal 2020, primarily related to a change in accrued compensation and other assets partially offset by changes in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue. The change in accrued compensation is primarily due to the settlement of our annual bonuses related to the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020 through the issuance of fully vested stock options in lieu of cash payments in June 2020. The change in other assets is primarily due to the receipt of receivables related to an employee withholding tax associated with the exercise of stock and the reclassification of offering costs related to our IPO to additional paid-in capital. The change in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue is primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable at February 28, 2021 due to the modification of payment terms with our airline customers, as well as the increase in accounts receivable related to an increase in the number of customers at February 28, 2021 as compared to February 29, 2020.\nIn October 2020, we closed a follow-on public offering of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock at an offering price of $38.50 per share, including 750,000 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of $208.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $12.7 million and net offering expenses of approximately $0.6 million.\nWe had no outstanding debt as of February 28, 2021. During July 2020, we terminated our Term Loan Facility. We currently have a revolving credit facility (2019 Revolver), which we entered into in July 2019.\nContractual Obligations\nCustomer Count - We believe that our ability to increase our number of customers is an indicator of our market penetration, the growth of our business, and our potential future business opportunities. We have successfully demonstrated a history of growing our customer base. As of February 28, 2021, we had 112 customers. We define the number of customers as of the measurement date as the number of companies that we are currently providing services to and that we have no reason to believe such services will be terminated, or that have entered into a contract with us for which the term has not ended and for which we have no reason to believe the customer intends to terminate or not renew the contract.\nApplication of these valuation approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment, and assumptions that are highly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses and future cash flows, discount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future events. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions impact our valuations as of each valuation date and may have a material impact on the valuation of our common stock.\nNet cash used in investing activities decreased by $1.1 million to $2.4 million during fiscal 2021 from $3.5 million during fiscal 2020, primarily due to a decrease in property and equipment purchases during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020.\n\nSome of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. We account for performance obligations separately if they are capable of being distinct within the context of the contract. In these circumstances, the transaction price is allocated to the separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. We determine the standalone selling prices based on overall pricing objectives, taking into consideration market conditions and other factors.\nOur cash flows from financing activities amounted to $428.4 million during fiscal 2021, mainly reflecting the net cash proceeds of $439.5 million as a result of our IPO and follow-on offering and proceeds from debt borrowings of $51.2 million, partially offset by debt repayments of $73.2 million.\nWe believe there is a substantial opportunity to further grow our customer base in our large and under-penetrated market through our sales and marketing strategy. Across our existing customer base and as we acquire new customers, we intend to expand and deepen these relationships. As we build trust through our proven model, we seek to cross-sell our add-on offerings, such as Accolade Boost, Trusted Supplier Program, COVID Response Care and Mental Health Integrated Care. We plan to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to grow our customer base and increase sales to existing customers. Any investments we make in our sales and marketing organization will occur in advance of experiencing any benefits from such investments, so it may be difficult for us to determine if we are efficiently allocating our resources in these areas.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $433.9 million as of February 28, 2021. Our cash equivalents are comprised primarily of cash and money market accounts held at banks.\nWe earn revenue from providing personalized technology-enabled solutions to the members of our employer customers' health plans and to members of fully insured plans offered via health insurance companies. Our solutions are priced based on a recurring PMPM fee and frequently include both a base PMPM fee based on eligible members and a performance-based component. As a result, a portion of our potential fee is typically variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics, the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions, and the number of eligible members during the respective period.\nstandards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have elected to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be subject to the same implementation timing of new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies until these standards apply to private companies unless we elect to early adopt as permitted by the relevant guidance for private companies.\nStock-Based Compensation\n (1) The stock-based compensation expense included above was as follows: \nOn March 29, 2021, we issued an aggregate of $287.5 million principal amount of 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d), including the exercise in full by the initial purchasers of their option to purchase up to an additional $37.5 million aggregate principal amount of the Notes, pursuant to an Indenture dated as of March 29, 2021 (the Indenture\u201d), between us and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee. The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per annum, payable semiannually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2021. The Notes will mature on April 1, 2026, unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased. The Notes are convertible into cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at our election.\nOperating Activities.\nRevenue increased $37.9 million, or 29%, to $170.4 million for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, referred to as fiscal 2021, as compared to $132.5 million for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, referred to as fiscal 2020. The increase was attributable primarily to growth in the number of customers served during fiscal 2021, as compared to fiscal 2020.\nThe critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.\nWe did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other purposes. We did not have any other off-balance sheet arrangements, except to the extent reflected under - Contractual Obligations\u201d above and in Note 13 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. As of February 28, 2021, we had $4.0 million of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. For the purposes of impairment testing, we have determined that we have one reporting unit. We perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether\nFactors Affecting Our Performance\nComparison of Fiscal Years Ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020\nWe operate our business through a single reportable segment. We operate on a fiscal year ending at the end of February of each year, and our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30, and the last day of February.\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel expenses, including sales commissions for our direct sales force and our market and business development workforce, as well as promotional costs, customer conferences, public relations, other marketing events, and allocated overhead costs. Personnel expenses include salaries,\nWe have chosen to invest significantly in growing our customer base, and plan to continue both adding new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers, which we believe will allow us to increase margins over time. When a customer renews their contract or purchases additional solutions or enhancements, the value realized from that customer increases because we generally do not incur significant incremental acquisition or implementation costs for the renewal or expansion. We believe that as our customer base grows and a higher percentage of our revenue is attributable to renewals and upsells or cross-sells to existing customers, relative to acquisition of new customers, associated sales and marketing expenses and other upfront costs will decrease as a percentage of revenue.\nit is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If that is the case, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently whenever an event or change in circumstances indicates that the asset may be impaired. In performing our evaluation we assess qualitative factors such as overall financial performance of our reporting unit, anticipated changes in industry and market structure, and the competitive and regulatory environment. No indicators of impairment were identified during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021 that required us to perform an interim assessment or recoverability test.\nAnnual Contract Value (ACV) - ACV represents the annualized value of our in-force contracts as of the measurement date, including base contractual revenue and the amount of performance-based variable revenue we expect to realize in the following fiscal year based on the number of members as of the measurement date and using a straight-line averaging of PMPM fees over the lives of the contracts. Over the past two complete fiscal years, we have realized in excess of 95% of the maximum contract value across our book of business. The ACV amounts above reflect 95% of the total revenue opportunity, consistent with the percentages realized in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 (calculated on the corresponding calendar year basis). We believe ACV provides investors with useful information on period-to-period\n\nCOVID-19 Update\n\n\nFor more information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 in the accompanying Notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn valuing our common stock prior to our IPO, our board of directors determined the enterprise value of our company using both the income approach and market approach valuation methods. The income approach estimates value based on the expectation of future cash flows that a company will generate. These future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a discount rate based on the cost of capital at a company's stage of development. The market approach estimates value based on a comparison of the subject company to comparable public companies in a similar line of business. From the comparable companies, a representative market value multiple is determined and then applied to the subject company's financial results to estimate the enterprise value of the subject company.\nContracts with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur Business Model\nThe following factors have been important to our business and we expect them to impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition in future periods:\nRealizability of Long-Lived Assets. We assess the realizability of our long-lived assets and related intangible assets, other than goodwill, quarterly, or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. We consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review: significant under-performance of a business or product line relative to budget; shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets; significant negative industry or economic trends; and the results of past impairment reviews. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability of these assets.\n \u25cf market multiples of comparable companies in our industry; \nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expense increased $5.4 million, or 21%, to $31.6 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $26.2 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel, preparation for our IPO, and ongoing operations as a public company after our IPO, as well as an increase in third-party consulting costs to support the expansion of our business and an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nBasis of Presentation and Components of Revenue and Expenses\nGrowth of Our Customer Base\n \u25cf recognition of revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. \nWe are constantly innovating to enhance our model and develop new offerings. Our ability to act as a trusted advisor to our members and customers positions us to identify new opportunities for additional offerings that can meet their existing and emerging needs. Our open technology platform also allows us to efficiently add new offerings and applications on top of our existing technology stack, which we have demonstrated with the recent roll-out of two new offerings, Accolade Total Benefits and Accolade Total Care, as well as our new add-on offerings, Accolade Boost, our Trusted Supplier Program, Accolade COVID Response Care, and Mental Health Integrated Care. We believe that as we expand our customer base and enter into new markets, we will be adept at identifying and deploying innovative new solutions whether developed internally or through acquisitions.\nFinancing Activities.\nHistorically for all periods prior to our IPO, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock, and in accordance with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, we exercised reasonable judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the best estimate of the fair value of our common stock including:\nWe have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in our future filings with the SEC. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different from the information you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests. In particular, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act) for complying with new or revised accounting\nAdoption of Current and Future Solutions\n\n\n \u25cf rights, preferences, and privileges of our convertible preferred stock relative to those of our common stock; \n \u25cf industry information such as market size and growth; \nWe have historically relied on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our total revenue. If we do not retain some or all of those customers, it could have a material negative impact on future results. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021, we had three customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, and in aggregate those three customers represented 38% of our total revenue. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2020, we had four customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue, and in aggregate those four customers represented 59% of our total revenue. The loss of any of our largest customers, the renegotiation of any of our largest customer contracts or a significant decrease in the employee headcount of our largest customers could adversely affect our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we engage in active discussions and renegotiations with our customers in respect to the solutions we provide and the terms of our customer agreements, including our fees. Most of our customer contracts have a three-year term, and some have rights to terminate prior to the end of the term.\nCash Flows\nFollowing our IPO, our board of directors relies on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the date of grant to determine the fair value of our common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nDiscussion and analysis of our fiscal year 2019, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2020 financial performance to 2019, have been omitted from this section and may be found under the heading Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in the Final Prospectus for our initial public offering (our IPO) dated as of July 1, 2020 and files with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) pursuant to Rule 424(b)(4) on July 2, 2020. Our fiscal year ends on the last day of February, and our fiscal quarters end on May 31, August 31, November 30, and the last day of February.\n (1) Includes the lease of our (a) corporate co-headquarters in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, which expires in June 2027, subject to certain early termination rights, (b) corporate co-headquarters in Seattle, Washington, which expires in September 2030, subject to certain early termination rights, (c) office space in Scottsdale, Arizona, which expires \nProduct and technology. Product and technology expense increased $7.6 million, or 18%, to $50.0 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $42.3 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to the addition of personnel in product development and product management in support of the development of new and existing offerings in connection with the expansion of our business, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nWe are an emerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) February 28, 2026 (the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our IPO), (ii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (iii) the last day of the first fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer\u201d, as defined in the rules under the Exchange Act, and (iv) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. We refer to the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 herein as the JOBS Act,\u201d and any reference herein to emerging growth company\u201d has the meaning ascribed to it in the JOBS Act.\n\nperformance as evaluated by management, comparison with our past financial performance, and a view toward potential future financial performance.\nWe have demonstrated a consistent track record of product and technology innovation over time as evidenced by continuous improvement of our platform and new offerings. This innovation is driven by feedback we receive from our customers, industry experts, and the market generally. For example, our technology platform has enabled us to unbundle aspects of Accolade Total Health and Benefits to create two additional standalone offerings: Accolade Total Benefits and Accolade Total Care. We have further leveraged our technology platform to develop add-on offerings that target specific challenges faced by our customers, including Accolade Boost and our Trusted Supplier Program - as well as very recently, Accolade COVID Response Care and Mental Health Integrated Care. Our investments in product and technology have been focused on increasing the value we provide via our personalized member health guidance solutions and expanding the market segments we can serve with a portfolio of offerings and associated price points.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCertain Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n \u25cf our actual operating and financial performance; \n\nEmerging Growth Company Status\n \u25cf identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer; \nIn addition, we have strategically curated our offering portfolio to ensure we have a compelling value proposition at an appropriate price point that resonates with each identified customer segment. Based on our experience, the opportunity to cross-sell is meaningfully enhanced once a customer has been on-boarded onto our platform and has benefited from a measurable and compelling return on their investment. Our customer partnerships team provides\n \u25cf determination of the transaction price; \nThe Term Loan was a secured credit facility that allowed us to borrow up to an aggregate principal amount of $24.5 million, with the total amount of available borrowings subject to certain monthly recurring revenue calculations. Interest on the outstanding balance was payable monthly at a rate of 8.00% per annum, plus 4.50% per annum deferred until the end of the term. The Term Loan was to mature on December 31, 2022. During July 2020, we repaid the Term Loan in full, including all outstanding interest and fees, and the Term Loan was terminated.\nWe provide personalized, technology-enabled solutions that help people better understand, navigate, and utilize the healthcare system and their workplace benefits. Our customers are primarily employers that deploy Accolade in order to provide employees and their families (our members\u201d) a single place to turn for their health, healthcare, and benefits needs. Our innovative platform combines open, cloud-based intelligent technology with multimodal support from a team of empathetic and knowledgeable Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians (including nurses, physician medical directors, and behavioral health specialists). We leverage our integrated capabilities, connectivity with providers and the broader healthcare ecosystem, and longitudinal data to engage across the entire member population, rather than focusing solely on high-cost claimants or those with chronic conditions. Our goal is to build trusted relationships with our members that ultimately position us to deliver personalized recommendations and interventions. We believe that our platform dramatically improves the member experience, encourages better health outcomes, and lowers costs for both our members and our customers.\nCustomer Concentration\nInterest expense, net\n \u25cf likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our company given prevailing market conditions and the nature and history of our business; \nWe assess recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models, which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows, we would perform a discounted cash flow analysis to assess impairments on long-lived assets. Variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge. Impairment charges, if any, result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values.\n\nKey Metrics\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expenses are primarily attributable to our capital investments and consist of fixed asset depreciation, amortization of intangibles considered to have definite lives, and amortization of capitalized internal-use software costs.\nOperating expenses\nAs required by GAAP, we recognize performance-based revenue over the minimum term of the applicable contract. In some cases, especially with regard to revenue associated with the realization of healthcare cost savings, revenue may be recognized in a fiscal period later than the period in which the required metric was achieved. Conversely, a fiscal period's revenue may include the recognition of revenue related to the achievement in prior periods of performance metrics and healthcare cost savings. For purposes of calculating ACV, we assume that all customer contracts expiring during the following fiscal year will renew on the same terms.\nCost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as net loss adjusted to exclude interest expense (net), income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and acquisition and integration-related costs. We believe Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with useful information on period-to-period performance as evaluated by management and comparison with our past financial performance. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful in evaluating our operating performance compared to that of other companies in our industry, as this measure generally eliminates the effects of certain items that may vary from company to company for reasons unrelated to overall operating performance.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. This requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the fair value of our underlying common stock, the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, the most critical of which, prior to our IPO, was the estimated fair value of common stock. The assumptions used in our option pricing model represent our best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management's judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. The resulting fair value, net of actual forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nRevenue\nAfter the equity value is determined and allocated to the various classes of shares, a discount for lack of marketability (DLOM) is applied to the various outcomes to arrive at the fair value of the common stock. A DLOM is applied based on the theory that as a private company, an owner of the stock has limited opportunities to sell this stock and any such sale would involve significant transaction costs, thereby reducing overall fair market value.\nWe provide our solutions primarily to employers that deploy Accolade offerings to our members. We earn revenue from providing personalized health guidance solutions to the members of our employer customers' health plans and to members of fully insured plans offered via health insurance companies. Our solutions are priced based on a recurring per-member-per-month (PMPM) fee, typically consisting of both a base fee and a performance-based fee component. As a result, generally, a portion of our potential revenue is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions. We typically achieve a substantial portion of the contractual performance metrics and realization in savings of healthcare spend.\n \u25cf allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and \n \u25cf macroeconomic conditions. \nResults of Operations\nDuring March 2020, we borrowed the available capacity of $48.7 to increase the Company's cash position given the uncertainty in the overall business environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During July 2020, subsequent to our IPO, we repaid the 2019 Revolver in full, including all outstanding interest. The 2019 Revolver expires in July 2021 and may be automatically extended for an additional 12 months if we meet certain revenue thresholds defined under the credit agreement. The Company has achieved those revenue thresholds, and the 12-month extension shall occur upon delivery of our fiscal 2021 audited financial statements to the 2019 Revolver agent, provided that no default or event of default, as defined, shall have occurred and be continuing.\nWe employ a multipronged go-to-market strategy to increase adoption of our solutions to new and existing customers. We principally sell our solutions through our direct salesforce which is stratified by account size (i.e., strategic (more than 35,000 employees), enterprise (5,000 to 35,000 employees), and mid-market (500 to 5,000 employees)), region, and existing versus prospective customers. Our sales team possesses deep domain expertise in health benefits management and brings substantial experience selling to key decision makers within our current and prospective customer organizations (CFOs, benefits executives, benefits consultants, and benefits brokers). We believe the effectiveness of our sales organization is evidenced by growing adoption of our platform by large strategic customers, recent traction with enterprise and mid-market customers and demonstrated demand for add-on offerings from existing customers.\nThe following table presents a summary of our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n \u25cf relevant precedent transactions involving our capital stock; \nbonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. We expect sales and marketing expense to increase in absolute dollars but remain stable as a percentage of revenue over time.\nSignificant investments in our technology platform have enhanced our capabilities with respect to how we engage with our members and deliver our solutions and care interventions. By leveraging our technology in areas such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and multimodal communication, we believe we can generate more efficiencies in our operating model while simultaneously improving our ability to deliver better health outcomes and lower costs for both our members and our customers. We will continue to invest in our technology platform to empower our Accolade Health Assistants, our clinicians, and our members to further improve and optimize efficiencies in our operating model. However, our investments in our technology platform may be more expensive or take longer to develop than we expect and may not result in operational efficiencies.\nAdjusted Gross Profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as revenue less cost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, and excluding stock-based compensation. We define Adjusted Gross Margin as our Adjusted Gross Profit divided by our revenue. We expect Adjusted Gross Margin to continue to improve over time to the extent that we are able to gain efficiencies through technology and successfully cross-sell and upsell our current and future offerings. However, our ability to improve Adjusted Gross Margin over time is not guaranteed and will be impacted by the factors affecting our performance discussed above and the risks outlined in the section titled Risk Factors.\u201d We believe Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin are useful to investors, as they eliminate the impact of certain non-cash expenses and allow a direct comparison of these measures between periods without the impact of non-cash expenses and certain other nonrecurring operating expenses.\nWe were founded in 2007 and launched our initial offering in 2009. We have seen significant growth in recent years since the changes to our executive management team in 2015 and the subsequent investments we have made in product, technology, sales, and distribution. As of February 28, 2021, we had 112 customers comprising more than 2.1 million members. Our customers come from across industries, including media, technology, financial services, transportation, energy, and retail.\nWe are required to estimate the fair value of the common stock underlying our stock-based awards when performing fair value calculations.\nAdjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel expenses and related expenses for our executive, finance and accounting, human resources, legal, and corporate organizations. Personnel expenses include salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors. In addition, general and administrative expenses include external legal, accounting, and other professional fees, as well as software for financial and human capital management, corporate insurance costs, and allocated overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we incur increased costs associated with being a public company, but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\n in April 2024, subject to certain early termination rights, (d) office space in Prague, Czech Republic, which expires in November 2021, and (e) office space in Santa Monica, California, which expires in February 2023. \nThese assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model, other than the fair value of our common stock, are estimated as follows:\n \u25cf illiquidity of stock-based awards involving securities in a private company; and \nWe use the following non-GAAP financial measures to help us evaluate trends, establish budgets, measure the effectiveness and efficiency of our operations, and determine employee incentives.\nCost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2021 and 2020 decreased to 55% from 56% of total revenue, respectively. This decrease was driven primarily by cost efficiencies relative to revenue realized through continuing to scale our business in fiscal 2021.\nCost of revenue, excluding depreciation and amortization increased $20.0 million, or 27%, to $93.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $73.7 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel and related costs to serve the customer base which grew in fiscal 2021, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, as compared to fiscal 2020.\nInvesting Activities.\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of February 28, 2021:\nThe PWERM estimates the value of the various equity classes based upon analysis of the future value for the enterprise under different potential outcomes including sale, merger, IPO, and dissolution. For each scenario, the value determined for the enterprise is allocated to each class of stock based upon the assumption that each class will maximize its value. The values determined for each class of stock under each scenario are weighted by the probability of each scenario and then discounted to a present value.\nThe 2019 Revolver contains a liquidity covenant calculated based on cash on hand plus available borrowings under the 2019 Revolver, a revenue covenant and certain reporting covenants. On August 21, 2020, we entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver which revised the terms of the revenue covenant and imposed minimum LIBOR and Base Rate levels. On September 11, 2020, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver which modified the allocation requirements of the Company's cash to be held at each of the two lenders participating in the 2019 Revolver. On November 6, 2020, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver which increased the capacity from $50.0 million to $80.0 million, subject to the achievement of certain milestones as defined in the amendment. On March 2, 2021, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver in association with the acquisition of 2nd.MD and amended certain covenants. On March 23, 2021, we entered into another amendment to the 2019 Revolver in association with the convertible senior notes offering.\nIn mid-March 2020, we closed our offices and enabled our employees to work remotely using our secure technologies to continue to meet the needs of our customers, their members, and our business. We measure our performance through several key metrics, including but not limited to customer satisfaction, member engagement, and health assistant availability. As gauged by these core performance metrics, service levels have been high, and member engagement and satisfaction have remained relatively strong. To ensure we could address our members' many COVID-19-related concerns, our operations and clinical leaders trained our frontline teams on evidence-based guidelines and continue to equip them with relevant resources to help them ably serve under these exceptional circumstances.\nGross Dollar Retention Rate (GDR) - Our ability to increase revenue depends in large part on our ability to retain our existing customers and their associated ACV. We typically enjoy a high rate of customer retention. For example, our GDR was 99% for both of the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020. We monitor GDR specifically as it relates to our employer customers, as our employer customers represent our primary strategic focus and today account for approximately 89% of our ACV. We calculate GDR for a period by starting with the sum of the ACV from all employer customers as of the beginning of such period (beginning of period ACV); we then subtract the ACV associated with terminated employer customers during the period and divide the result by the beginning of period ACV.\n \u25cf Expected term. We estimate the expected term using the simplified method, as we do not have sufficient historical exercise activity to develop reasonable expectations about future exercise patterns and post-vesting employment termination behavior. The simplified method calculates the average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding as the midpoint between the vesting date and the contractual expiration date of the award. \nWe include consideration for our revenue related to the achievement of performance metrics and the realization of healthcare cost savings when it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue will not occur. We estimate revenue using the most likely amount that we will receive. Estimates are based on our historical experience and best judgment at the time. Our estimates related to variable consideration are updated quarterly, and the total transaction price and revenue recognized are adjusted accordingly.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.3 million, or 4%, to $8.2 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $8.5 million for fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily due to certain capitalized software becoming fully depreciated during fiscal 2021, resulting in less depreciation expense as compared to the prior period.\nOperating Expenses\n \u25cf stage of development; \nUnder ASC 606, we recognize revenue when control of the promised services is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those services. Accordingly, we determine revenue recognition by applying the following steps:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe maintain relationships with a range of third parties, including brokers, agents, benefits consultants, carriers, third-party administrators, trusted suppliers, and co-marketing and co-selling partners. These third parties provide an important source of referrals for our sales organization. We also selectively form strategic alliances to further drive customer acquisition and adoption of our solutions. For example, in March 2019, we partnered with Humana and formed a joint go-to-market strategy, which we launched in two initial geographic markets. In October 2019, concurrent with a $20 million preferred stock investment from Humana, we expanded our partnership to add a broader base of solutions targeting self- and fully-insured customer prospects and significantly expand our target geographic markets. We believe the breadth of our go-to-market and distribution strategy enables us to reach customers of nearly every size and across markets.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur Debt Arrangements\nThe resulting equity values derived by the income approach and market approach were then allocated between share classes by a hybrid of the Probability Weighted Expected Return Method (PWERM) and the Option Pricing Method (OPM). The hybrid method was selected to consider various outcomes for our company including an initial public offering or continuing as a private company. The values of the share classes under an initial public offering scenario were based on the expected pricing and timing of the anticipated event according to the PWERM. Conversely, the OPM was used to estimate the value of the share classes assuming we stayed private.\nIn most of our contracts, a portion of our potential fee is variable, subject to our achievement of performance metrics and the realization of savings in healthcare spend by our customers resulting from the utilization of our solutions and thus we might record higher revenue in some quarters compared to others. Examples of performance metrics included in our customer contracts are achievement of specified member engagement levels, member satisfaction levels, and various operational metrics. Although we have earned over 95% of the aggregate maximum potential revenue under our contracts (measured on the corresponding calendar year basis) in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, our revenue and financial results in the future may vary as a result of our ability to earn this performance-based revenue. In addition, because our customers typically pay both the base PMPM fees and variable PMPM fees in advance on a periodic basis,\n\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operation data expressed as a percentage of revenue:\nSales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense increased $3.7 million, or 12%, to $33.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $30.1 million for fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the size of our direct sales force, account management, marketing, and supporting functions associated with the expansion of our business, as well as an increase in employee bonus compensation, offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expense.\nAccolade Total Health and Benefits is our most comprehensive offering and most closely aligns to our Premier\u201d solution on which the company was founded and from which the majority of our revenues are derived today. Our technology platform has enabled us to unbundle aspects of this comprehensive offering to create two additional standalone offerings: Accolade Total Benefits (focused on member benefits engagement) and Accolade Total Care (focused on guiding members to high-quality, cost-effective providers). We have further leveraged our technology platform to develop add-on offerings, such as Accolade Boost, our Trusted Supplier Program, Accolade COVID Response Care, and Mental Health Integrated Care that target specific challenges faced by our customers. Through our acquisition of Innovation Specialists, LLC d/b/a 2nd.MD (2nd.MD) we also acquired the capability to provide an expert medical consultation and medical decision support service, which may be provided as a standalone service or with elements incorporated into our core offerings.\nany required refund as a result of our failure to earn the performance-based revenue could have a negative impact on cash flows.\nAchievement of Performance-Based Revenue\nInvestments in Technology\nFor the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020, our total revenue was $170.4 million and $132.5 million, respectively, representing 29% year-over-year growth for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020. For the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020, our net losses were $50.7 million and $51.4 million, respectively.\nGross margin, excluding depreciation and amortization, for the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020 increased to 45.0% from 44.4%, respectively, and Adjusted Gross Margin for the fiscal years ended February 28(29), 2021 and 2020 increased to 45.6% from 44.6%, respectively. These increases were driven primarily by (i) increases in revenue associated with our offering mix and (ii) cost efficiencies realized through enhancements of our technology platform and workflows for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2021.\nstrategic insights, point solution recommendations, and day-to-day account support to our customers. They are focused on existing customer retention, cross-sell, and upsell.\nWe earn revenue from our customers by providing personalized health guidance solutions to members. Our solutions allow members to interact with our Accolade Health Assistants and clinicians through various means of communication, including telephony and secure messaging via our mobile application and member web portal. We price our personalized health guidance solutions using a recurring PMPM fee, typically with a portion of the fee calculated as the product of a fixed rate times the number of eligible members (fixed PMPM fee), plus a variable PMPM fee calculated as the product of a variable rate times the number of eligible members (variable PMPM fee). The fees associated with the variable PMPM fee can be earned through the achievement of performance metrics and/or the realization of healthcare cost savings resulting from the utilization of our services. In addition, our revenue is dependent on the number of members each month and the timing of revenue recognition discussed under Key Metrics - Annual Contract Value.\u201d As a result, we may report higher revenue in certain quarters relative to others. While we believe we have visibility into the seasonality of our business on a customer-by-customer basis, our rapid growth over the periods discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may have made seasonal fluctuations more difficult to detect. If our rate of growth slows over time, seasonal or cyclical variations in our operations may become more pronounced, and the comparability of our results of operations between periods may be materially affected.\nRevenue\nThe OPM treats common stock and convertible preferred stock as call options on the enterprise's value, with exercise prices based on the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock. Under this method, the common stock has value only if the funds available for distribution exceed the value of liquidation preference at the time of a liquidity event. If the total equity value exceeds the total liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock, the preferred stock will receive a payout in cash in the case of a liquidation event or in common stock in the case of an IPO, and the preferred stock will then convert to common stock. Any incremental value above the total liquidation preference would be shared based on the converted ownership interests.\nThe 2019 Revolver provides for a senior secured revolving line of credit in the amount of up to $80.0 million, with borrowing availability subject to certain monthly recurring revenue calculations. The interest rate on any outstanding borrowings will be at LIBOR plus 350 basis points or the lending institution's base rate plus 250 basis points, subject to certain floors, and interest payments are to be made in installments of one, two, or three months as chosen by us. During November 2020, the Company entered into an amendment to the 2019 Revolver, increasing the borrowing capacity to the maximum of $80.0 million. We also have an outstanding letter of credit to serve as an office landlord security deposit in the amount of $1.1 million. This letter of credit is secured through the revolving credit facility, thus reducing the capacity of the revolving credit facility to $78.9 million.\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin and Adjusted EBITDA have certain limitations, including that they exclude the impact of certain non-cash charges, such as depreciation and amortization, whereas underlying assets may need to be replaced and result in cash capital expenditures, and stock-based compensation expense, which is a recurring charge. These non-GAAP financial measures may also not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because they may not calculate such measures in the same manner, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we expect to incur expenses similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Our presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by these expenses or any unusual or nonrecurring items. When evaluating our performance, you should consider these non-GAAP financial measures alongside other financial performance measures, including the most directly comparable GAAP measures set forth in the reconciliation tables below and our other GAAP results. The following table presents, for the periods indicated, the calculation of our Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted Gross Margin:\n\nWe did not have any other contractual obligations, except as discussed above.\nOverview\nIn the application of this method, the convertible features of the preferred equity classes, common options and warrants outstanding are considered.\nProduct and technology. Product and technology expenses include costs to build new offerings, add new features to our existing solutions, and to manage, operate, and ensure the reliability and scalability of our existing technology platform. Product and technology expenses consist of personnel expenses, including salaries, bonuses, stock-based compensation expense, and benefits for employees and contractors for our engineering, product, and design teams, and allocated overhead costs, as well as costs of software and tools for business analytics, data management, and IT applications that are not directly associated with delivery of our solutions to customers. We expect product and technology expenses to increase in absolute dollars but decrease as a percentage of revenue over time.\n \u25cf contemporaneous valuations performed at periodic intervals by unrelated third-party specialists; \nWe believe our value proposition now resonates with an even broader audience of employers as they turn their focus to safely reopening their workplaces and managing the ongoing health and well-being of employees and their families. To directly address the former, we have developed Accolade COVID Response Care, a solution that allows employers of all sizes to leverage Accolade's platform to support employee education, testing, care plans, contact tracing, and return-to-work clearance. On the latter, we believe that the current disruptions to traditional care consumption have reinforced the need for navigation services, and that projected increases in healthcare costs (due to some combination of COVID-19-related testing and care, complications stemming from neglected non-COVID conditions, pent-up demand for elective services, and strain on individuals' mental health) prompt the need for solutions such as ours that bend the cost curve, and improve health outcomes, by driving good utilization up and wasteful utilization down.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations to date, the future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak, impact on our customers and our sales cycles, impact on our marketing efforts, and any decreases of workforce or benefits spending by our customers, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. We have a diverse set of customers across a variety of industries. While some have faced headwinds, others have experienced growth, and our membership count from existing customers has remained steady in the aggregate since the start of the 2020 calendar year. However, we may experience increased member attrition to the extent our existing customers reduce their respective workforces in response to the current economic conditions. Any layoffs or reductions in employee headcounts by our employer customers would result in a reduction in our base and variable PMPM fees. In one case, a small customer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and terminated its health plan and associated Accolade services as of October 31, 2020. In addition, our airline customers have had significant headcount reductions, which have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, a reduction of revenues associated with these customers. We may not experience the impact of changes to our customers' headcounts immediately because employees that are on furlough or are receiving continued health coverage pursuant to COBRA may still have access to our services during such periods and would be included in our member count. We have also\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nWe will continue to evaluate the values of our long-lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules. As changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur, we may be required to record impairment charges.\nThe following table presents, for the periods indicated, a reconciliation of our Adjusted EBITDA to our net loss:\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nengaged with our airline customers to act as a partner in managing their cash needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in modified payment terms in fiscal 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA\n\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nInterest expense, net increased $0.8 million, or 27%, to $3.7 million for fiscal 2021, as compared to $2.9 million for fiscal 2020. The increase primarily reflected the increase in our debt borrowings during fiscal 2021 as compared to fiscal 2020 along with expenses incurred in terminating our Term Loan Facility in July 2020.\n \u25cf Expected volatility. Since a public market for our common stock did not exist prior to our IPO in July 2020 and, therefore, we do not have an extensive trading history of our common stock, we estimated the expected volatility based on the volatility of similar publicly-held entities (guideline companies) over a period equivalent to the expected term of the awards. In evaluating the similarity of guideline companies to us, we considered factors such as industry, stage of life cycle, size, and financial leverage. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar guideline companies to estimate the expected volatility until sufficient historical information regarding the volatility of the share price of our common stock becomes available. \nAccounting for Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nSpecifically, some contracts contain an additional performance obligation, pre-launch open enrollment, for which the performance obligation is satisfied before the launch of our primary offering. For contracts that include pre-launch open enrollment support, we recognize related revenue over the pre-launch open enrollment period based on the number of eligible participants.\nThe primary cost of delivering our service includes the personnel costs of Accolade Health Assistants, clinicians, including registered nurses, physician medical directors, pharmacists, behavioral health specialists, women's health specialists, and case management specialists, as well as software and tools for telephony, workforce management, business analytics, allocated overhead costs, and other expenses related to delivery and implementation of our solutions. As we support more customers with an increasing number of members over time, we expect that our support costs per member will decline due to economies of scale and improved operational efficiencies driven by continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities. We have experienced and expect to continue to achieve operational efficiencies realized from continued enhancements of our technology platform and capabilities.\n \u25cf Expected dividend yield. We have never declared or paid any dividends and do not presently plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we use an expected dividend yield of zero. \n (2) The Company met certain revenue thresholds defined under the 2019 Revolver credit agreement which will result in a 12-month extension through July 2022 upon delivery of the audited financial statements to the 2019 Revolver agent, provided that no default or event of default, as defined, shall have occurred and be continuing. Additional fees will be incurred through that date. \nCost of Revenue, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization", "item_7_tables": "Table 142: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
