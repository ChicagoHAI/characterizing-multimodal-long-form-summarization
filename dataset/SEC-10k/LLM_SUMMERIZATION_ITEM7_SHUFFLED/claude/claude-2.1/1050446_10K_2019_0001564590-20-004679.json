For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact, including without limitation, certain statements regarding industry prospects and our results of operations or financial position, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d expects,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The important factors discussed under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements made herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such forward-looking statements represent management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Investors are warned that actual results may differ from management's expectations.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nIn accordance with the SEC's recently issued disclosure simplification rules, we have elected to exclude from this Annual Report discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, as adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, including comparison of our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOverview\nMicroStrategy is a global leader in enterprise analytics software and services. The MicroStrategy platform brings together data from our customers' enterprise applications, such as their financial systems, human resources systems, and supply chain management and customer relationship management tools, and provides analytics for actionable insights. Customers can also use our consulting and education offerings to harness MicroStrategy's innovative technology and empower their workforce to make better decisions.\nOver recent years, we have invested in innovation by making our platform more usable, powerful, scalable, flexible, and secure. Examples of these innovations include:\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> HyperIntelligence products that enable more users in the organization to access information rapidly by providing cards with contextual intelligence, suggestions, and workflows directly within the websites, applications, and mobile devices that people rely on every day.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Mobile productivity apps that deploy our technology on any standard device for a variety of business functions and roles.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Open architecture, including federated analytics, that provides analysts and data scientists with seamless access to trusted, governed data directly within their favorite tools, including Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, and more. Recent integrations also allow data scientists to access trusted, governed data, enrich that data with AI, and return it back to the MicroStrategy platform.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Flexible deployment methods that allow our customers to deploy our platform efficiently and securely using their own hardware or in a cloud environment they manage or via MCE, our cloud subscription service.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries, including retail, consulting, technology, manufacturing, banking, insurance, finance, healthcare, telecommunications, as well as the public sector.\nThe analytics market is highly competitive. Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate our offerings from those offered by large software vendors that provide products across multiple lines of business, including one or more products that directly compete with our offerings, and other potential competitors across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes. We believe a key differentiator of MicroStrategy is our comprehensive, modern, and open enterprise analytics and mobility platform that uniquely features HyperIntelligence, transformational mobility, and federated analytics.\nThe following table sets forth certain operating highlights (in thousands) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product licenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 87,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 88,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product licenses and subscription services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 117,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 292,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 296,216\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,427\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 83,795\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 486,327\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 497,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product licenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subscription services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total product licenses and subscription services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product support\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,242\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 54,365\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60,773\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cost of revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,974\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 99,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 386,353\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 398,139\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 191,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 205,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109,423\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 102,499\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 86,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 387,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 394,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed in Note 15, Sale of Domain Name, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on May 30, 2019, we completed the sale of our Voice.com domain name (the Domain Name Sale\u201d), resulting in a one-time gain of $29.8 million, recorded in Other income (expense), net\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and an associated discrete tax provision of $8.1 million during the second quarter of 2019.\nAs discussed in Note 10, Share-based Compensation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our class A common stock and certain other stock-based awards under our 2013 Equity Plan. Share-based compensation expense (in thousands) from these awards was recognized in the following operating expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of subscription services revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of product support revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of consulting revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of education revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,572\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, we estimated that approximately $36.8 million of additional share-based compensation expense for awards granted under the 2013 Equity Plan will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 3.2 years.\nWe base our internal operating expense forecasts on expected revenue trends and strategic objectives. Many of our expenses, such as office leases and certain personnel costs, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in our operating results. We therefore believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe are providing supplemental financial measures for (i) non-GAAP income from operations that excludes the impact of our share-based compensation arrangements, (ii) non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact from the Tax Act in 2018 and the Domain Name Sale in 2019, and (iii) certain non-GAAP constant currency revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses that exclude foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. The first supplemental financial measure excludes a significant non-cash expense that we believe is not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment and the resulting share-based compensation expense could vary significantly in comparison to other companies. The second set of supplemental financial measures excludes the impact from the Tax Act, which was a one-time tax charge, and the Domain Name Sale, which is outside of our normal business operations. The third set of supplemental financial measures excludes changes resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates so that results may be compared to the same period in the prior year on a non-GAAP constant currency basis. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures can also facilitate comparison of our operating results to those of our competitors.\nNon-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first non-GAAP financial measure, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.\nThe following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of our share-based compensation arrangements to its most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reconciliation of non-GAAP income from operations:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Loss) income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,002\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,981\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share-based compensation expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,209\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,636\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP income from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following are reconciliations of our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in each case excluding the impact of the Tax Act in 2018 and the Domain Name Sale in 2019, to their most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands, except per share data) for the periods indicated:\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reconciliation of non-GAAP net income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 22,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Measurement-period adjustment related to the Tax Act\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,106\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from Domain Name Sale, net of tax\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP net income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reconciliation of non-GAAP diluted earnings per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.33\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Measurement-period adjustment related to the Tax Act (per diluted share)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.27\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from Domain Name Sale, net of tax (per diluted share)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.70\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following are reconciliations of our non-GAAP constant currency revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses to their most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands) for the periods indicated.

These estimates, particularly estimates relating to revenue recognition, have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue using a five-step model:\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> Identifying the contract(s) with a customer,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> Identifying the performance obligation(s),\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> Determining the transaction price,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iv)\n</td> <td> Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (v)\n</td> <td> Recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have elected to exclude taxes assessed by government authorities in determining the transaction price, and therefore revenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers.\nPerformance Obligations and Timing of Revenue Recognition\nWe primarily sell goods and services that fall into the categories discussed below. Each category contains one or more performance obligations that are either (i) capable of being distinct (i.e., the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with readily available resources, including those purchased separately from us) and distinct within the context of the contract (i.e., separately identifiable from other promises in the contract) or (ii) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Aside from our term and perpetual product licenses, which are delivered at a point in time, the majority of our services are delivered over time.\nProduct Licenses\nWe sell different types of business intelligence software, licensed on a term or perpetual basis and installed either on premises or on a public cloud that is procured and managed by the customer. Although product licenses are sold with product support, the software is fully functional at the outset of the arrangement and is considered a distinct performance obligation. Revenue from product license sales is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the customer, which is the later of delivery or commencement of the license term. We may also sell through resellers and OEMs who purchase our software for resale. In reseller arrangements, revenue is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the end user. In OEM arrangements, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the license to the OEM.\nSubscription Services\nWe also sell access to our software through MCE, a cloud subscription service, wherein customers access the software through a cloud environment that we manage on behalf of the customer. Control of the software itself does not transfer to the customer under this arrangement and is not considered a separate performance obligation. Cloud subscriptions are regularly sold on a standalone basis and include telephone support, monitoring, backups, updates, and quarterly service reviews. Revenue related to cloud subscriptions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to the software.\nProduct Support\nIn all product license transactions, customers are required to purchase a standard product support package and may also purchase a premium product support package for a fixed annual fee. All product support packages include both technical support and when-and-if-available software upgrades, which are treated as a single performance obligation as they are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same duration and measure of progress. Revenue from product support is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to product support.\nConsulting Services\nWe sell consulting services to help customers plan and execute deployment of our software. Customers are not required to use consulting services to fully benefit from the software. Consulting services are regularly sold on a standalone basis and either (i) prepaid upfront or (ii) sold on a time and materials basis. Consulting arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize (or are not modified or customized by) each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customer's ability to use the other consulting services or our other offerings. Revenue under consulting arrangements is recognized over time as services are delivered. For time and materials-based consulting arrangements, we have elected the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing since the invoiced amount corresponds directly to the value of our service to date.\nEducation Services\nWe sell various education and training services to our customers. Education services are sold on a standalone basis under three different arrangements: (i) prepaid bulk training units that may be redeemed on training courses based on standard redemption rates, (ii) an annual subscription to unlimited training courses, and (iii) individual courses purchased a la carte. Education arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize (or are not modified or customized by) each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customer's ability to use the other education services or our other offerings. Revenue on prepaid bulk training units and individual course purchases are recognized when the courses are delivered. Revenue on the annual subscription is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to unlimited training courses.\nSee Note 14, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding total revenues by geographic region.\nEstimates and Judgments\nWe make estimates and judgments to allocate the transaction price based on an observable or estimated standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d). We also make estimates and judgements with respect to capitalizing incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and determining the subsequent amortization period. These estimates and judgments are discussed further below.\nDetermining the Transaction Price\nThe transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The amount of variable consideration excluded from the transaction price was not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our estimates of variable consideration are also subject to subsequent true-up adjustments and may result in changes to our transaction prices. Such true-up adjustments have not been and are not expected to be material. We have the following sources of variable consideration:\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> Performance penalties - Subscription services and product support arrangements generally contain performance response time guarantees. For subscription services arrangements, we estimate variable consideration using a portfolio approach because performance penalties are tied to standard up-time requirements. For product support arrangements, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such arrangements are customer-specific. For both subscription services and product support arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate variable consideration based on historical business practices and current and future performance expectations to determine the likelihood of incurring penalties.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> Extended payment terms - Our standard payment terms are generally within 180 days of invoicing. If extended payment terms are granted to customers, those terms generally do not exceed one year. For contracts with extended payment terms, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such estimates are customer-specific, and we use an expected value approach to analyze historical business experience on a customer-by-customer basis to determine the likelihood that extended payment terms lead to an implied price concession.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> Sales and usage-based royalties - Certain product license arrangements include sales or usage-based royalties, covering both product license and product support. In these arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate and recognize revenue for royalty sales each period, utilizing historical data on a contract-by-contract basis. True-up adjustments are recorded in subsequent periods when royalty reporting is received from the OEMs.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide a standard software assurance warranty to repair, replace, or refund software that does not perform in accordance with documentation. The standard software assurance warranty period is generally less than one year. Assurance warranty claims were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nWe do not adjust the transaction price for significant financing components where the time period between cash payment and performance is one year or less. However, there are circumstances where the timing between cash payment and performance may exceed one year. These circumstances generally involve prepaid multi-year product support and subscription services arrangements where the customer determines when the service is utilized (e.g., when to request on-call support services or when to use and access the software in the cloud). In these circumstances, we have determined no significant financing component exists because the customer controls when to utilize the service and because there are significant business purposes behind the timing difference between payment and performance (e.g., maximizing profit in the case of product support services and ensuring collectability in the case of subscription services).\nAllocating the Transaction Price Based on Standalone Selling Prices (SSP)\nWe allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in a contract based on its relative SSP. The SSP is the price, or estimated price, of the software or service when sold on a standalone basis at contract inception. In circumstances where SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP using the following methodologies:\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (i)\n</td> <td> Product licenses - Product licenses are not sold on a standalone basis and pricing is highly variable. We establish SSP of product licenses using a residual approach after first establishing the SSP of standard product support. Standard product support is sold on a standalone basis within a narrow range of the net license fee, and because an economic relationship exists between product licenses and standard product support, we have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of product licenses sold on both a perpetual and term basis is a fair allocation of the transaction price.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (ii)\n</td> <td> Subscription services - Given the highly variable selling price of subscription services, we establish the SSP of our subscription services arrangements using a similar residual approach after first establishing the SSP of consulting and education services to the extent they are included in the arrangement. We have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of our subscription services is a fair allocation of the transaction price.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iii)\n</td> <td> Standard product support - We establish SSP of standard product support as a percentage of the stated net license fee, given such pricing is consistent with our normal pricing practices and there exists sufficient history of customers renewing standard product support on a standalone basis at similar percentages. Each quarter, we track renewal rates negotiated when standard product support is initially sold with a perpetual license in order to determine the SSP of standard product support within each geographic region for the upcoming quarter. If the stated standard product support fee falls within the SSP range, the specific rate in the contract will be used to estimate SSP. If the stated fee is above or below SSP, the highest or lowest end of the range, respectively, will generally be used to estimate SSP of standard product support.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> (iv)\n</td> <td> Premium product support, consulting services, and education services - SSP of premium product support, consulting services, and education services is established by using a bell-shaped curve approach to define a narrow range within each geographic region in which the services are discounted off of the list price on a standalone basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe often provide options to purchase future offerings at a discount. We analyze the option price against the previously established SSP of the goods or services to determine if the options represent material rights that should be accounted for as separate performance obligations. In general, an option sold at or above SSP is not considered a material right because the customer could have received that right without entering into the contract. If a material right exists, revenue associated with the option is deferred and recognized when the future goods or services are transferred, or when the option expires. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, separate performance obligations arising from future purchase options have not been material.\nIncremental Costs to Obtain Customer Contracts\nIncremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers include certain variable compensation (e.g., commissions and bonuses) paid to our sales team. Although we may bundle our goods and services into one contract, commissions are individually determined on each distinct good or service in the contract. We expense as incurred those amounts earned on consulting and education services, which are generally performed within a one-year period and primarily sold on a standalone basis. We also expense as incurred those amounts earned on product license sales, since the amount is earned when the license is delivered. We capitalize those amounts earned on product support and initial-year cloud subscriptions and amortize the costs over a period of time that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer, which we have determined to be a period of three years. Although we typically sell product support and cloud subscriptions for a period of one year, a majority of customers renew their product support and cloud subscription arrangements. Three years is generally the period after which platforms are no longer supported by our support team and when customers generally choose to upgrade their software platform. Although we pay variable compensation on cloud subscription renewals, commissions paid on cloud subscription renewals are not considered commensurate with the initial contract year. We expense as incurred those amounts earned on all cloud subscription renewals as the renewal periods are generally for one year and the variable compensation on these renewals are commensurate with each other. We do not pay variable compensation on product support renewals.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRevenues\nExcept as otherwise indicated herein, the term domestic\u201d refers to operations in the United States and Canada and the term international\u201d refers to operations outside of the United States and Canada.\nProduct licenses and subscription services revenues.

compared to the prior year. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, product licenses transactions with more than $0.5 million in recognized revenue represented 28.7% and 32.1%, respectively, of our product licenses revenues. During 2019, our top three product licenses transactions totaled $5.4 million in recognized revenue, or 6.2% of total product licenses revenues, compared to $7.7 million, or 8.7% of total product licenses revenues, during 2018.\nDomestic product licenses revenues. Domestic product licenses revenues decreased $3.0 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the average deal size of transactions with more than $1.0 million in recognized revenue and a decrease in the number of transactions with recognized revenue between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\nInternational product licenses revenues. International product licenses revenues increased $2.4 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions with less than $0.5 million in recognized revenue and an increase in the average deal size of transactions with more than $1.0 million in recognized revenue, partially offset by a $3.6 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact and a decrease in the number of transactions with recognized revenue between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\nSubscription services revenues.

Cost of product licenses revenues consists of amortization of capitalized software development costs, referral fees paid to channel partners, the costs of product manuals and media, and royalties paid to third-party software vendors. Capitalized software development costs are generally amortized over a useful life of three years.\nCost of product licenses revenues decreased $2.7 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $2.5 million decrease in amortization of capitalized software development costs related to MicroStrategy 10\u2122, which became fully amortized in May 2018. As of December 31, 2019, all previously capitalized software development costs have been fully amortized.\nCost of subscription services revenues. Cost of subscription services revenues consists of equipment, facility and other related support costs, and personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of subscription services revenues increased $1.5 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in third-party hosting service provider fees, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in equipment, facility, and other related support costs. Subscription services headcount increased 23.2% to 69 at December 31, 2019 from 56 at December 31, 2018.\nCost of product support revenues. Cost of product support revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of product support revenues increased $8.1 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $7.7 million increase in compensation and related costs due to an increase in services provided by our consulting personnel under our Enterprise Support program and an increase in product support staffing levels. Our Enterprise Support program utilizes primarily consulting personnel to provide product support to our customers at our discretion. Compensation related to consulting personnel providing Enterprise Support services is reported as cost of product support revenues. Product support headcount increased 8.4% to 219 at December 31, 2019 from 202 at December 31, 2018.\nCost of consulting revenues. Cost of consulting revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of consulting revenues decreased $5.9 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to an increase in services provided by our consulting personnel under our Enterprise Support program, the associated costs of which are allocated to cost of product support revenues, and a decrease in consulting staffing levels and a $0.5 million decrease in recruiting costs. Included in cost of consulting revenues for 2019 is an aggregate $1.7 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Consulting headcount decreased 13.3% to 392 at December 31, 2019 from 452 at December 31, 2018.\nCost of education revenues. Cost of education revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of education revenues did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year.

The $1.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense is primarily due to the forfeiture of certain stock options, including those related to the departures of two executive officers in 2019, and certain awards under the 2013 Equity Plan becoming fully vested, partially offset by the grant of additional awards under the 2013 Equity Plan. Included in sales and marketing expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $5.2 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales and marketing headcount decreased 15.6% to 597 at December 31, 2019 from 707 at December 31, 2018.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist of the personnel costs for our software engineering personnel, depreciation of equipment, and other related costs.

The increase in research and development expenses reflects our previously announced strategy to seek to take greater advantage of the opportunities in the market by increasing our research and development expenditures as we invest in our technology offerings and personnel. The $0.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense is primarily due to certain awards under the 2013 Equity Plan becoming fully vested, partially offset by the grant of additional awards under the 2013 Equity Plan. Included in research and development expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $1.1 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Research and development headcount increased 3.8% to 743 at December 31, 2019 from 716 at December 31, 2018. All of our capitalized software development costs were fully amortized as of May 2018. Due to the pace of our software development efforts and frequency of our software releases, our software development costs are currently expensed as incurred. We do not expect to capitalize material software development costs in the near term.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs, and other costs of our executive, finance, human resources, information systems, and administrative departments, as well as third-party consulting, legal, and other professional fees. The following table sets forth general and administrative expenses (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,697\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 86,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year.

General and administrative headcount decreased 2.9% to 338 at December 31, 2019 from 348 at December 31, 2018.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net is comprised primarily of proceeds from the Domain Name Sale and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. During 2019, other income, net, of $28.4 million was comprised primarily of a $29.8 million gain from the Domain Name Sale in the second quarter of 2019. During 2018, other income, net, of $4.6 million was comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction net gains arising mainly from the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated cash balances held at international locations.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nDuring 2019, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.9 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.2%, as compared to a benefit from income taxes of $2.0 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of (9.9)% during 2018. The change in our effective tax rate in 2019, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the change in the proportion of U.S. versus foreign income and the benefit from the $3.1 million measurement-period adjustment discussed below.\nThe Tax Act imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax ( Transition Tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company recorded a final tax expense of $37.2 million related to the Transition Tax, comprised of a provisional Transition Tax obligation of $40.3 million in 2017 and a subsequent $(3.1) million measurement-period adjustment in 2018. The Company has elected to pay the Transition Tax over an eight-year period beginning in 2018, as permitted under the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2019, $28.9 million of the Transition Tax was unpaid, of which $28.0 million is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d and $0.9 million is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and operating lease liabilities\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no U.S. federal net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards and $4.1 million of foreign NOL carryforwards. As of December 31, 2019, foreign NOL carryforwards, other temporary differences and carryforwards, and credits resulted in deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities, of $19.4 million.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $2.1 million primarily related to certain foreign tax credit carryforwards that, in our present estimation, more likely than not will not be realized. If we are unable to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a charge that would materially adversely affect net income in the period in which the charge is incurred. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we intend to indefinitely reinvest $231.2 million of our undistributed foreign earnings. This amount takes into consideration a repatriation we made during 2019. After taking into account the Transition Tax, the Company estimates such repatriation generated only an immaterial U.S. tax expense related to U.S. state income taxes.\nDeferred Revenue and Advance Payments\nDeferred revenue and advance payments represent amounts received or due from our customers in advance of our transferring our software or services to the customer. Revenue is subsequently recognized in the period(s) in which control of the software or services is transferred to the customer.\nThe following table summarizes deferred revenue and advance payments (in thousands), as of:\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred product licenses revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,768\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred subscription services revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred product support revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 161,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 152,501\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred other services revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current deferred revenue and advance payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 187,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 176,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-current:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred product licenses revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred subscription services revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred product support revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,417\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred other services revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total non-current deferred revenue and advance payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current and non-current:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred product licenses revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,310\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred subscription services revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred product support revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 165,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 155,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred other services revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total current and non-current deferred revenue and advance payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 191,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 183,009\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal deferred revenue and advance payments increased $8.4 million in 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in product support and subscription services contracts, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred product licenses and other services revenues and a decrease in our international deferred revenue balances from the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The increase in product support contracts was partially due to renewals that were delayed from the fourth quarter of 2018.\nWe expect to recognize approximately $187.1 million of deferred revenue and advance payments over the next 12 months. However, the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our satisfaction of various performance obligations, and the amount of deferred revenue and advance payments at any date should not be considered indicative of revenues for any succeeding period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and on-going collection of our accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents may include holdings in bank demand deposits, money market instruments, certificates of deposit, and U.S. Treasury securities. We also periodically invest a portion of our excess cash in short-term investments with stated maturity dates between three months and one year from the purchase date.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our U.S. entities was $289.4 million and $173.6 million, respectively, and by our non-U.S. entities was $276.2 million and $402.5 million, respectively. We earn a significant amount of our revenues outside the United States and our accumulated foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $431.2 million and $397.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we intend to indefinitely reinvest $231.2 million of our undistributed foreign earnings. This amount takes into consideration a repatriation we made during 2019. After taking into account the Transition Tax, the Company estimates such repatriation generated only an immaterial U.S. tax expense related to U.S. state income taxes. We do not anticipate needing to repatriate additional cash or cash equivalents held by non-U.S. entities to the United States to finance our U.S. operations.\nWe believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by us and cash and cash equivalents anticipated to be generated by us are sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60,867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 472.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 353,687\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (209,064\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -269.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (66,150\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (108,515\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -39.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The primary source of our cash provided by operating activities is cash collections of our accounts receivable from customers following the sales and renewals of our product licenses and product support, as well as consulting, education, and subscription services, and, in 2019, consideration received from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs. Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures for software development, personnel-related expenditures for providing consulting, education, and subscription services, and for sales and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, and income taxes.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $50.2 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, due to a $28.9 million increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities, a $9.5 million increase from changes in non-cash items, and a $11.9 million increase in net income. Included in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 is a gain of $21.7 from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs. Non-cash items consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, sales allowances and bad debt expense, deferred taxes, release of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and share-based compensation expense.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities. The changes in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities primarily relate to purchases and redemptions of short-term investments and expenditures on property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities increased $562.8 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, due to a $373.5 million decrease in purchases of short-term investments and a $192.6 million increase in proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nNet cash used in financing activities. The changes in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities primarily relate to the purchase of treasury stock and the exercise of stock options under the 2013 Equity Plan. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $42.4 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $38.3 million decrease in purchases of treasury stock and a $4.1 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the 2013 Equity Plan.\nShare repurchases. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $800.0 million of our class A common stock from time to time on the open market through April 29, 2023 under the Share Repurchase Program, although the program may be suspended or discontinued by us at any time. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program may be funded using working capital, as well as proceeds from any other funding arrangements that we may enter into in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of 521,843 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of $139.35 and an aggregate cost of $72.7 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased an aggregate of 880,667 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of $126.02 and an aggregate cost of $111.0 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.\nContractual obligations.

As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.7 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, recorded in Other long-term liabilities.\u201d The timing of any payments that could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend on a number of factors, and accordingly the amount and period of any future payments cannot be estimated. We do not expect any significant tax payments related to these obligations during 2020.\nOff-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that had a material impact on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nRecent Accounting Standards\nSee Note 3, Recent Accounting Standards, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>", "item_7_truncated": "We provide a standard software assurance warranty to repair, replace, or refund software that does not perform in accordance with documentation.

These estimates, particularly estimates relating to revenue recognition, have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nSales and marketing expenses.

Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate our offerings from those offered by large software vendors that provide products across multiple lines of business, including one or more products that directly compete with our offerings, and other potential competitors across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes. We believe a key differentiator of MicroStrategy is our comprehensive, modern, and open enterprise analytics and mobility platform that uniquely features HyperIntelligence, transformational mobility, and federated analytics.\nWe sell different types of business intelligence software, licensed on a term or perpetual basis and installed either on premises or on a public cloud that is procured and managed by the customer. Although product licenses are sold with product support, the software is fully functional at the outset of the arrangement and is considered a distinct performance obligation. Revenue from product license sales is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the customer, which is the later of delivery or commencement of the license term. We may also sell through resellers and OEMs who purchase our software for resale. In reseller arrangements, revenue is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the end user. In OEM arrangements, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the license to the OEM.\nCost of product licenses revenues. Cost of product licenses revenues consists of amortization of capitalized software development costs, referral fees paid to channel partners, the costs of product manuals and media, and royalties paid to third-party software vendors. Capitalized software development costs are generally amortized over a useful life of three years.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Product Licenses Transactions with Recognized Licenses Revenue in the Applicable Period:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> More than $1.0 million in licenses revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Between $0.5 million and $1.0 million in licenses revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> More than $1.0 million in licenses revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Between $0.5 million and $1.0 million in licenses revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> More than $1.0 million in licenses revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Between $0.5 million and $1.0 million in licenses revenue recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by us and cash and cash equivalents anticipated to be generated by us are sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nThe transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration.

Subscription services revenues are derived from MCE, a cloud subscription service, that are recognized ratably over the service period of the contract. Subscription services revenues did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year.\nWe do not adjust the transaction price for significant financing components where the time period between cash payment and performance is one year or less. However, there are circumstances where the timing between cash payment and performance may exceed one year. These circumstances generally involve prepaid multi-year product support and subscription services arrangements where the customer determines when the service is utilized (e.g., when to request on-call support services or when to use and access the software in the cloud). In these circumstances, we have determined no significant financing component exists because the customer controls when to utilize the service and because there are significant business purposes behind the timing difference between payment and performance (e.g., maximizing profit in the case of product support services and ensuring collectability in the case of subscription services).\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 191,235\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 205,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -7.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther services revenues.

The first supplemental financial measure excludes a significant non-cash expense that we believe is not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment and the resulting share-based compensation expense could vary significantly in comparison to other companies. The second set of supplemental financial measures excludes the impact from the Tax Act, which was a one-time tax charge, and the Domain Name Sale, which is outside of our normal business operations. The third set of supplemental financial measures excludes changes resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates so that results may be compared to the same period in the prior year on a non-GAAP constant currency basis. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures can also facilitate comparison of our operating results to those of our competitors.\n\nAllocating the Transaction Price Based on Standalone

and subscription services revenues. The following table sets forth product licenses and subscription services revenues (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nProduct licenses revenues decreased $0.6 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, product licenses transactions with more than $0.5 million in recognized revenue represented 28.7% and 32.1%, respectively, of our product licenses revenues. During 2019, our top three product licenses transactions totaled $5.4 million in recognized revenue, or 6.2% of total product licenses revenues, compared to $7.7 million, or 8.7% of total product licenses revenues, during 2018.\n</td> </tr>\nItem 7.\nWe often provide options to purchase future offerings at a discount. We analyze the option price against the previously established SSP of the goods or services to determine if the options represent material rights that should be accounted for as separate performance obligations. In general, an option sold at or above SSP is not considered a material right because the customer could have received that right without entering into the contract. If a material right exists, revenue associated with the option is deferred and recognized when the future goods or services are transferred, or when the option expires. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, separate performance obligations arising from future purchase options have not been material.\nDomestic product licenses revenues. Domestic product licenses revenues decreased $3.0 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the average deal size of transactions with more than $1.0 million in recognized revenue and a decrease in the number of transactions with recognized revenue between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\n\nConsulting revenues. Consulting revenues are derived from helping customers plan and execute the deployment of our software. Consulting revenues decreased $5.0 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in billable hours worldwide and a $1.9 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, partially offset by an increase in average bill rates.\n\nThe following table sets forth certain operating highlights (in thousands) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we intend to indefinitely reinvest $231.2 million of our undistributed foreign earnings. This amount takes into consideration a repatriation we made during 2019. After taking into account the Transition Tax, the Company estimates such repatriation generated only an immaterial U.S. tax expense related to U.S. state income taxes.\nThe following table sets forth the recognized revenue (in thousands) attributable to product licenses transactions, grouped by size, and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist of the personnel costs for our software engineering personnel, depreciation of equipment, and other related costs. The following table summarizes research and development expenses and amortization of capitalized software development costs (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $2.1 million primarily related to certain foreign tax credit carryforwards that, in our present estimation, more likely than not will not be realized. If we are unable to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a charge that would materially adversely affect net income in the period in which the charge is incurred. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets.\n (i) Product licenses - Product licenses are not sold on a standalone basis and pricing is highly variable. We establish SSP of product licenses using a residual approach after first establishing the SSP of standard product support. Standard product support is sold on a standalone basis within a narrow range of the net license fee, and because an economic relationship exists between product licenses and standard product support, we have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of product licenses sold on both a perpetual and term basis is a fair allocation of the transaction price. \n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2019, we estimated that approximately $36.8 million of additional share-based compensation expense for awards granted under the 2013 Equity Plan will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 3.2 years.\nWe have elected to exclude taxes assessed by government authorities in determining the transaction price, and therefore revenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers.\nThe following are reconciliations of our non-GAAP constant currency revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses to their most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands) for the periods indicated. As discussed in Note 3, Recent Accounting Standards, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted ASU 2014-09 effective as of January 1, 2018 and adjusted our prior period Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect full retrospective adoption. Where applicable, information for the year ended December 31, 2017 within the following reconciliations was also adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, as presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. No further adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2017 have been made in this Annual Report.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRecent Accounting Standards\n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $14.3 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an $8.5 million decrease in marketing and advertising costs, a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to a decrease in staffing levels, a $3.6 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenditures, a $1.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $1.6 million decrease in recruiting costs, and a $0.5 million decrease in subcontractor costs, partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in variable compensation, a $1.8 million increase in facility and other related support costs, and a $0.6 million increase in the amortization of capitalized variable compensation. The $1.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense is primarily due to the forfeiture of certain stock options, including those related to the departures of two executive officers in 2019, and certain awards under the 2013 Equity Plan becoming fully vested, partially offset by the grant of additional awards under the 2013 Equity Plan. Included in sales and marketing expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $5.2 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales and marketing headcount decreased 15.6% to 597 at December 31, 2019 from 707 at December 31, 2018.\nSee Note 3, Recent Accounting Standards, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOverview\n \u2022 Mobile productivity apps that deploy our technology on any standard device for a variety of business functions and roles. \n\nOur customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries, including retail, consulting, technology, manufacturing, banking, insurance, finance, healthcare, telecommunications, as well as the public sector.\nOther Income, Net\nUnrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.7 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, recorded in Other long-term liabilities.\u201d The timing of any payments that could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend on a number of factors, and accordingly the amount and period of any future payments cannot be estimated. We do not expect any significant tax payments related to these obligations during 2020.\nWe are providing supplemental financial measures for (i) non-GAAP income from operations that excludes the impact of our share-based compensation arrangements, (ii) non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact from the Tax Act in 2018 and the Domain Name Sale in 2019, and (iii) certain non-GAAP constant currency revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses that exclude foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no U.S. federal net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards and $4.1 million of foreign NOL carryforwards. As of December 31, 2019, foreign NOL carryforwards, other temporary differences and carryforwards, and credits resulted in deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities, of $19.4 million.\nWe primarily sell goods and services that fall into the categories discussed below. Each category contains one or more performance obligations that are either (i) capable of being distinct (i.e., the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with readily available resources, including those purchased separately from us) and distinct within the context of the contract (i.e., separately identifiable from other promises in the contract) or (ii) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Aside from our term and perpetual product licenses, which are delivered at a point in time, the majority of our services are delivered over time.\nWe sell consulting services to help customers plan and execute deployment of our software. Customers are not required to use consulting services to fully benefit from the software. Consulting services are regularly sold on a standalone basis and either (i) prepaid upfront or (ii) sold on a time and materials basis. Consulting arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize (or are not modified or customized by) each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customer's ability to use the other consulting services or our other offerings. Revenue under consulting arrangements is recognized over time as services are delivered. For time and materials-based consulting arrangements, we have elected the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing since the invoiced amount corresponds directly to the value of our service to date.\nEducation revenues. Education revenues are derived from the education and training that we provide to our customers to enhance their ability to fully utilize the features and functionality of our software. These offerings include self-tutorials, custom course development, joint training with customers' internal staff, and standard course offerings, with pricing dependent on the specific offering delivered. Education revenues decreased $1.4 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in overall contract values.\nCost of revenues. The following table sets forth cost of revenues (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n (3) The Non-GAAP Constant Currency % Change\u201d reflects the percentage change between the current period Non-GAAP Constant Currency amount and the GAAP amount for the same period in the prior year. \nWe base our internal operating expense forecasts on expected revenue trends and strategic objectives. Many of our expenses, such as office leases and certain personnel costs, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in our operating results. We therefore believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nCost of education revenues. Cost of education revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of education revenues did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year. Education headcount decreased 19.1% to 38 at December 31, 2019 from 47 at December 31, 2018.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nDeferred Revenue and Advance Payments\nOver recent years, we have invested in innovation by making our platform more usable, powerful, scalable, flexible, and secure. Examples of these innovations include:\n (1) The Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Impact\u201d reflects the estimated impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on international components of our Consolidated Statements of Operations. It shows the increase (decrease) in material international revenues or expenses, as applicable, from the same period in the prior year, based on comparisons to the prior year quarterly average foreign currency exchange rates. The term international\u201d refers to operations outside of the United States and Canada. \n\n (iv) Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and \nEducation Services\nWe allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in a contract based on its relative SSP. The SSP is the price, or estimated price, of the software or service when sold on a standalone basis at contract inception. In circumstances where SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP using the following methodologies:\nOther income, net is comprised primarily of proceeds from the Domain Name Sale and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. During 2019, other income, net, of $28.4 million was comprised primarily of a $29.8 million gain from the Domain Name Sale in the second quarter of 2019. During 2018, other income, net, of $4.6 million was comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction net gains arising mainly from the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated cash balances held at international locations.\nIncremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers include certain variable compensation (e.g., commissions and bonuses) paid to our sales team. Although we may bundle our goods and services into one contract, commissions are individually determined on each distinct good or service in the contract. We expense as incurred those amounts earned on consulting and education services, which are generally performed within a one-year period and primarily sold on a standalone basis. We also expense as incurred those amounts earned on product license sales, since the amount is earned when the license is delivered. We capitalize those amounts earned on product support and initial-year cloud subscriptions and amortize the costs over a period of time that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer, which we have determined to be a period of three years. Although we typically sell product support and cloud subscriptions for a period of one year, a majority of customers renew their product support and cloud subscription arrangements. Three years is generally the period after which platforms are no longer supported by our support team and when customers generally choose to upgrade their software platform. Although we pay variable compensation on cloud subscription renewals, commissions paid on cloud subscription renewals are not considered commensurate with the initial contract year. We expense as incurred those amounts earned on all cloud subscription renewals as the renewal periods are generally for one year and the variable compensation on these renewals are commensurate with each other. We do not pay variable compensation on product support renewals.\nCost of product licenses revenues decreased $2.7 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $2.5 million decrease in amortization of capitalized software development costs related to MicroStrategy 10\u2122, which became fully amortized in May 2018. As of December 31, 2019, all previously capitalized software development costs have been fully amortized.\nSubscription Services\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.9 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an $8.3 million increase in compensation and related costs due to an increase in staffing levels and a $1.9 million increase in facility and other related support costs, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in technology infrastructure, a $0.7 million decrease in consulting and advisory costs, and a $0.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense. The increase in research and development expenses reflects our previously announced strategy to seek to take greater advantage of the opportunities in the market by increasing our research and development expenditures as we invest in our technology offerings and personnel. The $0.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense is primarily due to certain awards under the 2013 Equity Plan becoming fully vested, partially offset by the grant of additional awards under the 2013 Equity Plan. Included in research and development expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $1.1 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Research and development headcount increased 3.8% to 743 at December 31, 2019 from 716 at December 31, 2018. All of our capitalized software development costs were fully amortized as of May 2018. Due to the pace of our software development efforts and frequency of our software releases, our software development costs are currently expensed as incurred. We do not expect to capitalize material software development costs in the near term.\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The primary source of our cash provided by operating activities is cash collections of our accounts receivable from customers following the sales and renewals of our product licenses and product support, as well as consulting, education, and subscription services, and, in 2019, consideration received from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs. Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures for software development, personnel-related expenditures for providing consulting, education, and subscription services, and for sales and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, and income taxes.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNon-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first non-GAAP financial measure, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.\n (iii) Standard product support - We establish SSP of standard product support as a percentage of the stated net license fee, given such pricing is consistent with our normal pricing practices and there exists sufficient history of customers renewing standard product support on a standalone basis at similar percentages. Each quarter, we track renewal rates negotiated when standard product support is initially sold with a perpetual license in order to determine the SSP of standard product support within each geographic region for the upcoming quarter. If the stated standard product support fee falls within the SSP range, the specific rate in the contract will be used to estimate SSP. If the stated fee is above or below SSP, the highest or lowest end of the range, respectively, will generally be used to estimate SSP of standard product support. \nEstimates and Judgments\nWe sell various education and training services to our customers. Education services are sold on a standalone basis under three different arrangements: (i) prepaid bulk training units that may be redeemed on training courses based on standard redemption rates, (ii) an annual subscription to unlimited training courses, and (iii) individual courses purchased a la carte. Education arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize (or are not modified or customized by) each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customer's ability to use the other education services or our other offerings. Revenue on prepaid bulk training units and individual course purchases are recognized when the courses are delivered. Revenue on the annual subscription is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to unlimited training courses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year. Included in general and administrative expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $1.0 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. General and administrative headcount decreased 2.9% to 338 at December 31, 2019 from 348 at December 31, 2018.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities. The changes in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities primarily relate to purchases and redemptions of short-term investments and expenditures on property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities increased $562.8 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, due to a $373.5 million decrease in purchases of short-term investments and a $192.6 million increase in proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nConsulting Services\nShare repurchases. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $800.0 million of our class A common stock from time to time on the open market through April 29, 2023 under the Share Repurchase Program, although the program may be suspended or discontinued by us at any time. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program may be funded using working capital, as well as proceeds from any other funding arrangements that we may enter into in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of 521,843 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of $139.35 and an aggregate cost of $72.7 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased an aggregate of 880,667 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of $126.02 and an aggregate cost of $111.0 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.\n</table>\n (iv) Premium product support, consulting services, and education services - SSP of premium product support, consulting services, and education services is established by using a bell-shaped curve approach to define a narrow range within each geographic region in which the services are discounted off of the list price on a standalone basis. \nWe make estimates and judgments to allocate the transaction price based on an observable or estimated standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d). We also make estimates and judgements with respect to capitalizing incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and determining the subsequent amortization period. These estimates and judgments are discussed further below.\nExcept as otherwise indicated herein, the term domestic\u201d refers to operations in the United States and Canada and the term international\u201d refers to operations outside of the United States and Canada.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $50.2 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, due to a $28.9 million increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities, a $9.5 million increase from changes in non-cash items, and a $11.9 million increase in net income. Included in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 is a gain of $21.7 from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs. Non-cash items consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, sales allowances and bad debt expense, deferred taxes, release of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and share-based compensation expense.\nTotal deferred revenue and advance payments increased $8.4 million in 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in product support and subscription services contracts, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred product licenses and other services revenues and a decrease in our international deferred revenue balances from the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The increase in product support contracts was partially due to renewals that were delayed from the fourth quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 Open architecture, including federated analytics, that provides analysts and data scientists with seamless access to trusted, governed data directly within their favorite tools, including Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, and more. Recent integrations also allow data scientists to access trusted, governed data, enrich that data with AI, and return it back to the MicroStrategy platform. \nLiquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and on-going collection of our accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents may include holdings in bank demand deposits, money market instruments, certificates of deposit, and U.S. Treasury securities. We also periodically invest a portion of our excess cash in short-term investments with stated maturity dates between three months and one year from the purchase date.\n\n\n\nProduct Support\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs, and other costs of our executive, finance, human resources, information systems, and administrative departments, as well as third-party consulting, legal, and other professional fees. The following table sets forth general and administrative expenses (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nAs discussed in Note 10, Share-based Compensation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our class A common stock and certain other stock-based awards under our 2013 Equity Plan. Share-based compensation expense (in thousands) from these awards was recognized in the following operating expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:\nForward-Looking Information\n (i) Identifying the contract(s) with a customer, \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCost of consulting revenues. Cost of consulting revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of consulting revenues decreased $5.9 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to an increase in services provided by our consulting personnel under our Enterprise Support program, the associated costs of which are allocated to cost of product support revenues, and a decrease in consulting staffing levels and a $0.5 million decrease in recruiting costs. Included in cost of consulting revenues for 2019 is an aggregate $1.7 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Consulting headcount decreased 13.3% to 392 at December 31, 2019 from 452 at December 31, 2018.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table sets forth a summary, grouped by size, of the number of recognized product licenses transactions for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n (i) Performance penalties - Subscription services and product support arrangements generally contain performance response time guarantees. For subscription services arrangements, we estimate variable consideration using a portfolio approach because performance penalties are tied to standard up-time requirements. For product support arrangements, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such arrangements are customer-specific. For both subscription services and product support arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate variable consideration based on historical business practices and current and future performance expectations to determine the likelihood of incurring penalties. \n (ii) Extended payment terms - Our standard payment terms are generally within 180 days of invoicing. If extended payment terms are granted to customers, those terms generally do not exceed one year. For contracts with extended payment terms, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such estimates are customer-specific, and we use an expected value approach to analyze historical business experience on a customer-by-customer basis to determine the likelihood that extended payment terms lead to an implied price concession. \nOff-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that had a material impact on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nProduct support revenues. The following table sets forth product support revenues (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n\nDuring 2019, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.9 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.2%, as compared to a benefit from income taxes of $2.0 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of (9.9)% during 2018. The change in our effective tax rate in 2019, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the change in the proportion of U.S. versus foreign income and the benefit from the $3.1 million measurement-period adjustment discussed below.\nWe expect to recognize approximately $187.1 million of deferred revenue and advance payments over the next 12 months. However, the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our satisfaction of various performance obligations, and the amount of deferred revenue and advance payments at any date should not be considered indicative of revenues for any succeeding period.\nCost of subscription services revenues. Cost of subscription services revenues consists of equipment, facility and other related support costs, and personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of subscription services revenues increased $1.5 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in third-party hosting service provider fees, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in equipment, facility, and other related support costs. Subscription services headcount increased 23.2% to 69 at December 31, 2019 from 56 at December 31, 2018.\nInternational product licenses revenues. International product licenses revenues increased $2.4 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions with less than $0.5 million in recognized revenue and an increase in the average deal size of transactions with more than $1.0 million in recognized revenue, partially offset by a $3.6 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact and a decrease in the number of transactions with recognized revenue between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\n\nPerformance Obligations and Timing of Revenue Recognition\n (ii) Subscription services - Given the highly variable selling price of subscription services, we establish the SSP of our subscription services arrangements using a similar residual approach after first establishing the SSP of consulting and education services to the extent they are included in the arrangement. We have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of our subscription services is a fair allocation of the transaction price. \n\n (v) Recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. \nResults of Operations\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of our share-based compensation arrangements to its most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThe Tax Act imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax ( Transition Tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company recorded a final tax expense of $37.2 million related to the Transition Tax, comprised of a provisional Transition Tax obligation of $40.3 million in 2017 and a subsequent $(3.1) million measurement-period adjustment in 2018. The Company has elected to pay the Transition Tax over an eight-year period beginning in 2018, as permitted under the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2019, $28.9 million of the Transition Tax was unpaid, of which $28.0 million is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d and $0.9 million is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and operating lease liabilities\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.", "item_7_text": "We provide a standard software assurance warranty to repair, replace, or refund software that does not perform in accordance with documentation. The standard software assurance warranty period is generally less than one year. Assurance warranty claims were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nMicroStrategy is a global leader in enterprise analytics software and services. The MicroStrategy platform brings together data from our customers' enterprise applications, such as their financial systems, human resources systems, and supply chain management and customer relationship management tools, and provides analytics for actionable insights. Customers can also use our consulting and education offerings to harness MicroStrategy's innovative technology and empower their workforce to make better decisions.\nThe following table summarizes deferred revenue and advance payments (in thousands), as of:\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and equity, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates, particularly estimates relating to revenue recognition, have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results and outcomes could differ from these estimates and assumptions.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel costs, commissions, office facilities, travel, advertising, public relations programs, and promotional events, such as trade shows, seminars, and technical conferences. The following table sets forth sales and marketing expenses (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n (2) The Non-GAAP Constant Currency\u201d reflects the current period GAAP amount, less the Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Impact. \nThe analytics market is highly competitive. Our future success depends on the effectiveness with which we can differentiate our offerings from those offered by large software vendors that provide products across multiple lines of business, including one or more products that directly compete with our offerings, and other potential competitors across analytics implementation projects of varying sizes. We believe a key differentiator of MicroStrategy is our comprehensive, modern, and open enterprise analytics and mobility platform that uniquely features HyperIntelligence, transformational mobility, and federated analytics.\nWe sell different types of business intelligence software, licensed on a term or perpetual basis and installed either on premises or on a public cloud that is procured and managed by the customer. Although product licenses are sold with product support, the software is fully functional at the outset of the arrangement and is considered a distinct performance obligation. Revenue from product license sales is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the customer, which is the later of delivery or commencement of the license term. We may also sell through resellers and OEMs who purchase our software for resale. In reseller arrangements, revenue is recognized when control of the license is transferred to the end user. In OEM arrangements, revenue is recognized upon delivery of the license to the OEM.\nCost of product licenses revenues. Cost of product licenses revenues consists of amortization of capitalized software development costs, referral fees paid to channel partners, the costs of product manuals and media, and royalties paid to third-party software vendors. Capitalized software development costs are generally amortized over a useful life of three years.\nWe believe that existing cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by us and cash and cash equivalents anticipated to be generated by us are sufficient to meet working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures, and contractual obligations for at least the next 12 months.\nThe transaction price includes both fixed and variable consideration. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal will not occur. The amount of variable consideration excluded from the transaction price was not material for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Our estimates of variable consideration are also subject to subsequent true-up adjustments and may result in changes to our transaction prices. Such true-up adjustments have not been and are not expected to be material. We have the following sources of variable consideration:\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n \u2022 Flexible deployment methods that allow our customers to deploy our platform efficiently and securely using their own hardware or in a cloud environment they manage or via MCE, our cloud subscription service. \nSee Note 14, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding total revenues by geographic region.\nDeferred revenue and advance payments represent amounts received or due from our customers in advance of our transferring our software or services to the customer. Revenue is subsequently recognized in the period(s) in which control of the software or services is transferred to the customer.\nCost of product support revenues. Cost of product support revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of product support revenues increased $8.1 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $7.7 million increase in compensation and related costs due to an increase in services provided by our consulting personnel under our Enterprise Support program and an increase in product support staffing levels. Our Enterprise Support program utilizes primarily consulting personnel to provide product support to our customers at our discretion. Compensation related to consulting personnel providing Enterprise Support services is reported as cost of product support revenues. Product support headcount increased 8.4% to 219 at December 31, 2019 from 202 at December 31, 2018.\n\nThe following are reconciliations of our non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, in each case excluding the impact of the Tax Act in 2018 and the Domain Name Sale in 2019, to their most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands, except per share data) for the periods indicated:\nAs discussed in Note 15, Sale of Domain Name, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, on May 30, 2019, we completed the sale of our Voice.com domain name (the Domain Name Sale\u201d), resulting in a one-time gain of $29.8 million, recorded in Other income (expense), net\u201d in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and an associated discrete tax provision of $8.1 million during the second quarter of 2019.\n (iii) Sales and usage-based royalties - Certain product license arrangements include sales or usage-based royalties, covering both product license and product support. In these arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate and recognize revenue for royalty sales each period, utilizing historical data on a contract-by-contract basis. True-up adjustments are recorded in subsequent periods when royalty reporting is received from the OEMs. \nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Exchange Act. For this purpose, any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact, including without limitation, certain statements regarding industry prospects and our results of operations or financial position, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words believes,\u201d anticipates,\u201d plans,\u201d expects,\u201d and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The important factors discussed under Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward-looking statements made herein and presented elsewhere by management from time to time. Such forward-looking statements represent management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Investors are warned that actual results may differ from management's expectations.\nWe recognize revenue using a five-step model:\nProduct support revenues are derived from providing technical software support and software updates and upgrades to customers. Product support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, which is generally one year. Product support revenues decreased $4.2 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $7.1 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, partially offset by an increase in new product support contracts and reductions in our estimated sales allowance reserves.\nProduct Licenses\nNet cash used in financing activities. The changes in net cash (used in) provided by financing activities primarily relate to the purchase of treasury stock and the exercise of stock options under the 2013 Equity Plan. Net cash used in financing activities decreased $42.4 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $38.3 million decrease in purchases of treasury stock and a $4.1 million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the 2013 Equity Plan.\nDetermining the Transaction Price\nIn accordance with the SEC's recently issued disclosure simplification rules, we have elected to exclude from this Annual Report discussion of our results for the year ended December 31, 2017. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017, as adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, including comparison of our results for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, is included in Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n (ii) Identifying the performance obligation(s), \n \u2022 HyperIntelligence products that enable more users in the organization to access information rapidly by providing cards with contextual intelligence, suggestions, and workflows directly within the websites, applications, and mobile devices that people rely on every day. \nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held by our U.S. entities was $289.4 million and $173.6 million, respectively, and by our non-U.S. entities was $276.2 million and $402.5 million, respectively. We earn a significant amount of our revenues outside the United States and our accumulated foreign earnings and profits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were $431.2 million and $397.4 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we intend to indefinitely reinvest $231.2 million of our undistributed foreign earnings. This amount takes into consideration a repatriation we made during 2019. After taking into account the Transition Tax, the Company estimates such repatriation generated only an immaterial U.S. tax expense related to U.S. state income taxes. We do not anticipate needing to repatriate additional cash or cash equivalents held by non-U.S. entities to the United States to finance our U.S. operations.\nWe also sell access to our software through MCE, a cloud subscription service, wherein customers access the software through a cloud environment that we manage on behalf of the customer. Control of the software itself does not transfer to the customer under this arrangement and is not considered a separate performance obligation. Cloud subscriptions are regularly sold on a standalone basis and include telephone support, monitoring, backups, updates, and quarterly service reviews. Revenue related to cloud subscriptions is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to the software.\n\nIn all product license transactions, customers are required to purchase a standard product support package and may also purchase a premium product support package for a fixed annual fee. All product support packages include both technical support and when-and-if-available software upgrades, which are treated as a single performance obligation as they are considered a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same duration and measure of progress. Revenue from product support is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to product support.\nSubscription services revenues. Subscription services revenues are derived from MCE, a cloud subscription service, that are recognized ratably over the service period of the contract. Subscription services revenues did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year.\nWe do not adjust the transaction price for significant financing components where the time period between cash payment and performance is one year or less. However, there are circumstances where the timing between cash payment and performance may exceed one year. These circumstances generally involve prepaid multi-year product support and subscription services arrangements where the customer determines when the service is utilized (e.g., when to request on-call support services or when to use and access the software in the cloud). In these circumstances, we have determined no significant financing component exists because the customer controls when to utilize the service and because there are significant business purposes behind the timing difference between payment and performance (e.g., maximizing profit in the case of product support services and ensuring collectability in the case of subscription services).\nOther services revenues. The following table sets forth other services revenues (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing our performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis. The first supplemental financial measure excludes a significant non-cash expense that we believe is not reflective of our general business performance, and for which the accounting requires management judgment and the resulting share-based compensation expense could vary significantly in comparison to other companies. The second set of supplemental financial measures excludes the impact from the Tax Act, which was a one-time tax charge, and the Domain Name Sale, which is outside of our normal business operations. The third set of supplemental financial measures excludes changes resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates so that results may be compared to the same period in the prior year on a non-GAAP constant currency basis. We believe the use of these non-GAAP financial measures can also facilitate comparison of our operating results to those of our competitors.\n\nAllocating the Transaction Price Based on Standalone Selling Prices (SSP)\nCosts and Expenses\nContractual obligations. The following table shows future minimum rent payments under noncancellable operating leases and purchase agreements with initial terms of greater than one year and anticipated payments related to the Transition Tax resulting from the Tax Act, based on the expected due dates of the various installments as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nRevenues\nIncremental Costs to Obtain Customer Contracts\nProduct licenses and subscription services revenues. The following table sets forth product licenses and subscription services revenues (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nProduct licenses revenues decreased $0.6 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, product licenses transactions with more than $0.5 million in recognized revenue represented 28.7% and 32.1%, respectively, of our product licenses revenues. During 2019, our top three product licenses transactions totaled $5.4 million in recognized revenue, or 6.2% of total product licenses revenues, compared to $7.7 million, or 8.7% of total product licenses revenues, during 2018.\n</td> </tr>\nItem 7.\nWe often provide options to purchase future offerings at a discount. We analyze the option price against the previously established SSP of the goods or services to determine if the options represent material rights that should be accounted for as separate performance obligations. In general, an option sold at or above SSP is not considered a material right because the customer could have received that right without entering into the contract. If a material right exists, revenue associated with the option is deferred and recognized when the future goods or services are transferred, or when the option expires. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, separate performance obligations arising from future purchase options have not been material.\nDomestic product licenses revenues. Domestic product licenses revenues decreased $3.0 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in the average deal size of transactions with more than $1.0 million in recognized revenue and a decrease in the number of transactions with recognized revenue between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\n\nConsulting revenues. Consulting revenues are derived from helping customers plan and execute the deployment of our software. Consulting revenues decreased $5.0 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in billable hours worldwide and a $1.9 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact, partially offset by an increase in average bill rates.\n\nThe following table sets forth certain operating highlights (in thousands) for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we intend to indefinitely reinvest $231.2 million of our undistributed foreign earnings. This amount takes into consideration a repatriation we made during 2019. After taking into account the Transition Tax, the Company estimates such repatriation generated only an immaterial U.S. tax expense related to U.S. state income taxes.\nThe following table sets forth the recognized revenue (in thousands) attributable to product licenses transactions, grouped by size, and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses consist of the personnel costs for our software engineering personnel, depreciation of equipment, and other related costs. The following table summarizes research and development expenses and amortization of capitalized software development costs (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a valuation allowance of $2.1 million primarily related to certain foreign tax credit carryforwards that, in our present estimation, more likely than not will not be realized. If we are unable to sustain or increase profitability in future periods, we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in a charge that would materially adversely affect net income in the period in which the charge is incurred. We will continue to regularly assess the realizability of deferred tax assets.\n (i) Product licenses - Product licenses are not sold on a standalone basis and pricing is highly variable. We establish SSP of product licenses using a residual approach after first establishing the SSP of standard product support. Standard product support is sold on a standalone basis within a narrow range of the net license fee, and because an economic relationship exists between product licenses and standard product support, we have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of product licenses sold on both a perpetual and term basis is a fair allocation of the transaction price. \n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis for the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nAs of December 31, 2019, we estimated that approximately $36.8 million of additional share-based compensation expense for awards granted under the 2013 Equity Plan will be recognized over a remaining weighted average period of 3.2 years.\nWe have elected to exclude taxes assessed by government authorities in determining the transaction price, and therefore revenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers.\nThe following are reconciliations of our non-GAAP constant currency revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses to their most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands) for the periods indicated. As discussed in Note 3, Recent Accounting Standards, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we adopted ASU 2014-09 effective as of January 1, 2018 and adjusted our prior period Consolidated Financial Statements to reflect full retrospective adoption. Where applicable, information for the year ended December 31, 2017 within the following reconciliations was also adjusted to reflect the full retrospective adoption of ASU 2014-09, as presented in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018. No further adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2017 have been made in this Annual Report.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018\nRecent Accounting Standards\n\nSales and marketing expenses decreased $14.3 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an $8.5 million decrease in marketing and advertising costs, a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to a decrease in staffing levels, a $3.6 million decrease in travel and entertainment expenditures, a $1.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense, a $1.6 million decrease in recruiting costs, and a $0.5 million decrease in subcontractor costs, partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in variable compensation, a $1.8 million increase in facility and other related support costs, and a $0.6 million increase in the amortization of capitalized variable compensation. The $1.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense is primarily due to the forfeiture of certain stock options, including those related to the departures of two executive officers in 2019, and certain awards under the 2013 Equity Plan becoming fully vested, partially offset by the grant of additional awards under the 2013 Equity Plan. Included in sales and marketing expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $5.2 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Sales and marketing headcount decreased 15.6% to 597 at December 31, 2019 from 707 at December 31, 2018.\nSee Note 3, Recent Accounting Standards, to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOverview\n \u2022 Mobile productivity apps that deploy our technology on any standard device for a variety of business functions and roles. \n\nOur customers include leading companies from a wide range of industries, including retail, consulting, technology, manufacturing, banking, insurance, finance, healthcare, telecommunications, as well as the public sector.\nOther Income, Net\nUnrecognized tax benefits. As of December 31, 2019, we had $1.7 million of total gross unrecognized tax benefits, including accrued interest, recorded in Other long-term liabilities.\u201d The timing of any payments that could result from these unrecognized tax benefits will depend on a number of factors, and accordingly the amount and period of any future payments cannot be estimated. We do not expect any significant tax payments related to these obligations during 2020.\nWe are providing supplemental financial measures for (i) non-GAAP income from operations that excludes the impact of our share-based compensation arrangements, (ii) non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share that exclude the impact from the Tax Act in 2018 and the Domain Name Sale in 2019, and (iii) certain non-GAAP constant currency revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses that exclude foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. These supplemental financial measures are not measurements of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) and, as a result, these supplemental financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures internally to help understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and to help make operating decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no U.S. federal net operating loss ( NOL\u201d) carryforwards and $4.1 million of foreign NOL carryforwards. As of December 31, 2019, foreign NOL carryforwards, other temporary differences and carryforwards, and credits resulted in deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances and deferred tax liabilities, of $19.4 million.\nWe primarily sell goods and services that fall into the categories discussed below. Each category contains one or more performance obligations that are either (i) capable of being distinct (i.e., the customer can benefit from the good or service on its own or together with readily available resources, including those purchased separately from us) and distinct within the context of the contract (i.e., separately identifiable from other promises in the contract) or (ii) a series of distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Aside from our term and perpetual product licenses, which are delivered at a point in time, the majority of our services are delivered over time.\nWe sell consulting services to help customers plan and execute deployment of our software. Customers are not required to use consulting services to fully benefit from the software. Consulting services are regularly sold on a standalone basis and either (i) prepaid upfront or (ii) sold on a time and materials basis. Consulting arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize (or are not modified or customized by) each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customer's ability to use the other consulting services or our other offerings. Revenue under consulting arrangements is recognized over time as services are delivered. For time and materials-based consulting arrangements, we have elected the practical expedient of recognizing revenue upon invoicing since the invoiced amount corresponds directly to the value of our service to date.\nEducation revenues. Education revenues are derived from the education and training that we provide to our customers to enhance their ability to fully utilize the features and functionality of our software. These offerings include self-tutorials, custom course development, joint training with customers' internal staff, and standard course offerings, with pricing dependent on the specific offering delivered. Education revenues decreased $1.4 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in overall contract values.\nCost of revenues. The following table sets forth cost of revenues (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n (3) The Non-GAAP Constant Currency % Change\u201d reflects the percentage change between the current period Non-GAAP Constant Currency amount and the GAAP amount for the same period in the prior year. \nWe base our internal operating expense forecasts on expected revenue trends and strategic objectives. Many of our expenses, such as office leases and certain personnel costs, are relatively fixed. Accordingly, any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in our operating results. We therefore believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance.\nCost of education revenues. Cost of education revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of education revenues did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year. Education headcount decreased 19.1% to 38 at December 31, 2019 from 47 at December 31, 2018.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nDeferred Revenue and Advance Payments\nOver recent years, we have invested in innovation by making our platform more usable, powerful, scalable, flexible, and secure. Examples of these innovations include:\n (1) The Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Impact\u201d reflects the estimated impact from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on international components of our Consolidated Statements of Operations. It shows the increase (decrease) in material international revenues or expenses, as applicable, from the same period in the prior year, based on comparisons to the prior year quarterly average foreign currency exchange rates. The term international\u201d refers to operations outside of the United States and Canada. \n\n (iv) Allocating the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract, and \nEducation Services\nWe allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation in a contract based on its relative SSP. The SSP is the price, or estimated price, of the software or service when sold on a standalone basis at contract inception. In circumstances where SSP is not directly observable, we estimate SSP using the following methodologies:\nOther income, net is comprised primarily of proceeds from the Domain Name Sale and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. During 2019, other income, net, of $28.4 million was comprised primarily of a $29.8 million gain from the Domain Name Sale in the second quarter of 2019. During 2018, other income, net, of $4.6 million was comprised primarily of foreign currency transaction net gains arising mainly from the revaluation of U.S. dollar denominated cash balances held at international locations.\nIncremental costs incurred to obtain contracts with customers include certain variable compensation (e.g., commissions and bonuses) paid to our sales team. Although we may bundle our goods and services into one contract, commissions are individually determined on each distinct good or service in the contract. We expense as incurred those amounts earned on consulting and education services, which are generally performed within a one-year period and primarily sold on a standalone basis. We also expense as incurred those amounts earned on product license sales, since the amount is earned when the license is delivered. We capitalize those amounts earned on product support and initial-year cloud subscriptions and amortize the costs over a period of time that is consistent with the pattern of transfer to the customer, which we have determined to be a period of three years. Although we typically sell product support and cloud subscriptions for a period of one year, a majority of customers renew their product support and cloud subscription arrangements. Three years is generally the period after which platforms are no longer supported by our support team and when customers generally choose to upgrade their software platform. Although we pay variable compensation on cloud subscription renewals, commissions paid on cloud subscription renewals are not considered commensurate with the initial contract year. We expense as incurred those amounts earned on all cloud subscription renewals as the renewal periods are generally for one year and the variable compensation on these renewals are commensurate with each other. We do not pay variable compensation on product support renewals.\nCost of product licenses revenues decreased $2.7 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $2.5 million decrease in amortization of capitalized software development costs related to MicroStrategy 10\u2122, which became fully amortized in May 2018. As of December 31, 2019, all previously capitalized software development costs have been fully amortized.\nSubscription Services\nResearch and development expenses increased $6.9 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an $8.3 million increase in compensation and related costs due to an increase in staffing levels and a $1.9 million increase in facility and other related support costs, partially offset by a $1.6 million decrease in technology infrastructure, a $0.7 million decrease in consulting and advisory costs, and a $0.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense. The increase in research and development expenses reflects our previously announced strategy to seek to take greater advantage of the opportunities in the market by increasing our research and development expenditures as we invest in our technology offerings and personnel. The $0.6 million net decrease in share-based compensation expense is primarily due to certain awards under the 2013 Equity Plan becoming fully vested, partially offset by the grant of additional awards under the 2013 Equity Plan. Included in research and development expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $1.1 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Research and development headcount increased 3.8% to 743 at December 31, 2019 from 716 at December 31, 2018. All of our capitalized software development costs were fully amortized as of May 2018. Due to the pace of our software development efforts and frequency of our software releases, our software development costs are currently expensed as incurred. We do not expect to capitalize material software development costs in the near term.\nNet cash provided by operating activities. The primary source of our cash provided by operating activities is cash collections of our accounts receivable from customers following the sales and renewals of our product licenses and product support, as well as consulting, education, and subscription services, and, in 2019, consideration received from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs. Our primary uses of cash in operating activities are for personnel-related expenditures for software development, personnel-related expenditures for providing consulting, education, and subscription services, and for sales and marketing costs, general and administrative costs, and income taxes.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNon-GAAP financial measures are subject to material limitations as they are not in accordance with, or a substitute for, measurements prepared in accordance with GAAP. For example, we expect that share-based compensation expense, which is excluded from the first non-GAAP financial measure, will continue to be a significant recurring expense over the coming years and is an important part of the compensation provided to certain employees, officers, and directors. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation and should be read only in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We rely primarily on such Consolidated Financial Statements to understand, manage, and evaluate our business performance and use the non-GAAP financial measures only supplementally.\n (iii) Standard product support - We establish SSP of standard product support as a percentage of the stated net license fee, given such pricing is consistent with our normal pricing practices and there exists sufficient history of customers renewing standard product support on a standalone basis at similar percentages. Each quarter, we track renewal rates negotiated when standard product support is initially sold with a perpetual license in order to determine the SSP of standard product support within each geographic region for the upcoming quarter. If the stated standard product support fee falls within the SSP range, the specific rate in the contract will be used to estimate SSP. If the stated fee is above or below SSP, the highest or lowest end of the range, respectively, will generally be used to estimate SSP of standard product support. \nEstimates and Judgments\nWe sell various education and training services to our customers. Education services are sold on a standalone basis under three different arrangements: (i) prepaid bulk training units that may be redeemed on training courses based on standard redemption rates, (ii) an annual subscription to unlimited training courses, and (iii) individual courses purchased a la carte. Education arrangements are each considered separate performance obligations because they do not integrate with each other or with other offerings to deliver a combined output to the customer, do not modify or customize (or are not modified or customized by) each other or other offerings, and do not affect the customer's ability to use the other education services or our other offerings. Revenue on prepaid bulk training units and individual course purchases are recognized when the courses are delivered. Revenue on the annual subscription is recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period, which is the period over which the customer has continuous access to unlimited training courses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses did not materially change during 2019, as compared to the prior year. Included in general and administrative expenses for 2019 is an aggregate $1.0 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. General and administrative headcount decreased 2.9% to 338 at December 31, 2019 from 348 at December 31, 2018.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities. The changes in net cash provided by (used in) investing activities primarily relate to purchases and redemptions of short-term investments and expenditures on property and equipment. Net cash provided by investing activities increased $562.8 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, due to a $373.5 million decrease in purchases of short-term investments and a $192.6 million increase in proceeds from the redemption of short-term investments, partially offset by a $3.3 million increase in purchases of property and equipment.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nConsulting Services\nShare repurchases. Our Board of Directors has authorized us to repurchase up to an aggregate of $800.0 million of our class A common stock from time to time on the open market through April 29, 2023 under the Share Repurchase Program, although the program may be suspended or discontinued by us at any time. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased will be determined by management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. The Share Repurchase Program may be funded using working capital, as well as proceeds from any other funding arrangements that we may enter into in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased an aggregate of 521,843 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of $139.35 and an aggregate cost of $72.7 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we repurchased an aggregate of 880,667 shares of our class A common stock at an average price per share of $126.02 and an aggregate cost of $111.0 million pursuant to the Share Repurchase Program.\n</table>\n (iv) Premium product support, consulting services, and education services - SSP of premium product support, consulting services, and education services is established by using a bell-shaped curve approach to define a narrow range within each geographic region in which the services are discounted off of the list price on a standalone basis. \nWe make estimates and judgments to allocate the transaction price based on an observable or estimated standalone selling price ( SSP\u201d). We also make estimates and judgements with respect to capitalizing incremental costs to obtain a customer contract and determining the subsequent amortization period. These estimates and judgments are discussed further below.\nExcept as otherwise indicated herein, the term domestic\u201d refers to operations in the United States and Canada and the term international\u201d refers to operations outside of the United States and Canada.\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased $50.2 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, due to a $28.9 million increase from changes in operating assets and liabilities, a $9.5 million increase from changes in non-cash items, and a $11.9 million increase in net income. Included in net cash provided by operating activities during 2019 is a gain of $21.7 from the Domain Name Sale, net of related income taxes and immaterial transaction costs. Non-cash items consist primarily of depreciation and amortization, sales allowances and bad debt expense, deferred taxes, release of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, and share-based compensation expense.\nTotal deferred revenue and advance payments increased $8.4 million in 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in product support and subscription services contracts, partially offset by the recognition of previously deferred product licenses and other services revenues and a decrease in our international deferred revenue balances from the general strengthening of the U.S. dollar. The increase in product support contracts was partially due to renewals that were delayed from the fourth quarter of 2018.\n \u2022 Open architecture, including federated analytics, that provides analysts and data scientists with seamless access to trusted, governed data directly within their favorite tools, including Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Qlik, and more. Recent integrations also allow data scientists to access trusted, governed data, enrich that data with AI, and return it back to the MicroStrategy platform. \nLiquidity. Our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and on-going collection of our accounts receivable. Cash and cash equivalents may include holdings in bank demand deposits, money market instruments, certificates of deposit, and U.S. Treasury securities. We also periodically invest a portion of our excess cash in short-term investments with stated maturity dates between three months and one year from the purchase date.\n\n\n\nProduct Support\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist of personnel and related overhead costs, and other costs of our executive, finance, human resources, information systems, and administrative departments, as well as third-party consulting, legal, and other professional fees. The following table sets forth general and administrative expenses (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\nAs discussed in Note 10, Share-based Compensation, to the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have outstanding stock options to purchase shares of our class A common stock and certain other stock-based awards under our 2013 Equity Plan. Share-based compensation expense (in thousands) from these awards was recognized in the following operating expense line items in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the periods indicated:\nForward-Looking Information\n (i) Identifying the contract(s) with a customer, \n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nCost of consulting revenues. Cost of consulting revenues consists of personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of consulting revenues decreased $5.9 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $5.4 million decrease in compensation and related costs due to an increase in services provided by our consulting personnel under our Enterprise Support program, the associated costs of which are allocated to cost of product support revenues, and a decrease in consulting staffing levels and a $0.5 million decrease in recruiting costs. Included in cost of consulting revenues for 2019 is an aggregate $1.7 million favorable foreign currency exchange impact. Consulting headcount decreased 13.3% to 392 at December 31, 2019 from 452 at December 31, 2018.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following table sets forth a summary, grouped by size, of the number of recognized product licenses transactions for the periods indicated:\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n (i) Performance penalties - Subscription services and product support arrangements generally contain performance response time guarantees. For subscription services arrangements, we estimate variable consideration using a portfolio approach because performance penalties are tied to standard up-time requirements. For product support arrangements, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such arrangements are customer-specific. For both subscription services and product support arrangements, we use an expected value approach to estimate variable consideration based on historical business practices and current and future performance expectations to determine the likelihood of incurring penalties. \n (ii) Extended payment terms - Our standard payment terms are generally within 180 days of invoicing. If extended payment terms are granted to customers, those terms generally do not exceed one year. For contracts with extended payment terms, we estimate variable consideration on a contract basis because such estimates are customer-specific, and we use an expected value approach to analyze historical business experience on a customer-by-customer basis to determine the likelihood that extended payment terms lead to an implied price concession. \nOff-balance sheet arrangements. As of December 31, 2019, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that had a material impact on our financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources.\nProduct support revenues. The following table sets forth product support revenues (in thousands) and related percentage changes for the periods indicated:\n\nDuring 2019, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $3.9 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of 10.2%, as compared to a benefit from income taxes of $2.0 million that resulted in an effective tax rate of (9.9)% during 2018. The change in our effective tax rate in 2019, as compared to the prior year, was primarily due to the change in the proportion of U.S. versus foreign income and the benefit from the $3.1 million measurement-period adjustment discussed below.\nWe expect to recognize approximately $187.1 million of deferred revenue and advance payments over the next 12 months. However, the timing and ultimate recognition of our deferred revenue and advance payments depend on our satisfaction of various performance obligations, and the amount of deferred revenue and advance payments at any date should not be considered indicative of revenues for any succeeding period.\nCost of subscription services revenues. Cost of subscription services revenues consists of equipment, facility and other related support costs, and personnel and related overhead costs. Cost of subscription services revenues increased $1.5 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in third-party hosting service provider fees, partially offset by a $0.6 million decrease in equipment, facility, and other related support costs. Subscription services headcount increased 23.2% to 69 at December 31, 2019 from 56 at December 31, 2018.\nInternational product licenses revenues. International product licenses revenues increased $2.4 million during 2019, as compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions with less than $0.5 million in recognized revenue and an increase in the average deal size of transactions with more than $1.0 million in recognized revenue, partially offset by a $3.6 million unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact and a decrease in the number of transactions with recognized revenue between $0.5 million and $1.0 million.\n\nPerformance Obligations and Timing of Revenue Recognition\n (ii) Subscription services - Given the highly variable selling price of subscription services, we establish the SSP of our subscription services arrangements using a similar residual approach after first establishing the SSP of consulting and education services to the extent they are included in the arrangement. We have concluded that the residual method to estimate SSP of our subscription services is a fair allocation of the transaction price. \n\n (v) Recognizing revenue when, or as, we satisfy a performance obligation. \nResults of Operations\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\nThe following is a reconciliation of our non-GAAP income from operations excluding the impact of our share-based compensation arrangements to its most directly comparable GAAP measures (in thousands) for the periods indicated:\nThe Tax Act imposed a mandatory deemed repatriation transition tax ( Transition Tax\u201d) on previously untaxed accumulated and current earnings and profits of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The Company recorded a final tax expense of $37.2 million related to the Transition Tax, comprised of a provisional Transition Tax obligation of $40.3 million in 2017 and a subsequent $(3.1) million measurement-period adjustment in 2018. The Company has elected to pay the Transition Tax over an eight-year period beginning in 2018, as permitted under the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2019, $28.9 million of the Transition Tax was unpaid, of which $28.0 million is included in Other long-term liabilities\u201d and $0.9 million is included in Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and operating lease liabilities\u201d in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.", "item_7_tables": "Table 134: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td>
