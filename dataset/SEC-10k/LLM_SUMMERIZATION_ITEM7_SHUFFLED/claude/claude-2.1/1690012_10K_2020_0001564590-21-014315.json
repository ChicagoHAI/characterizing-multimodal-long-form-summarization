All dollar amounts are stated in thousands, except share data.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed on September 13, 2016 to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE investments primarily comprised of (i) CRE debt, including floating-rate first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans, and participations in such loans and (ii) floating-rate CRE securities such as CMBS and senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs. We may also invest in select equity investments in single-tenant, net leased properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We are externally managed by our Advisor, an indirect subsidiary of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation. Our Advisor has engaged the Sub-Advisor, a subsidiary of Sound Point CRE Management, LP, to perform certain services on behalf of the Advisor for us.\nWe have operated in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2017. Among other requirements, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nFor a discussion of the history of the Company and its Private Offering and IPO, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 1 - Organization and Business Operations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements below.\nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the timing and amount of capital raised, the composition of our investment portfolio, the amount of leverage applied to our investment portfolio and our net interest income. Several macroeconomic factors impact the interest rate environment and our target assets, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\nMarket Conditions\nThe economic conditions that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our investments during the year ended December 31, 2020. Prior to the pandemic, we held approximately $156.6 million in CMBS of which a significant portion consisted of interests in hotel property loans. The value of the CMBS declined as travel, in-person gatherings and shopping were restricted due to the pandemic. We began selling the CMBS portfolio in April 2020 and, as the effects of the pandemic continued, we eventually made the decision to exit the CMBS market and sold all our CMBS recognizing $35.0 million in losses.\nOur CRE loan portfolio has performed well through the pandemic with every loan, other than the loan secured by the Renaissance O'Hare, making all of their scheduled debt service payments during 2020 in accordance with their respective terms, which included modifications to one hospitality loan, one retail loan and two office loans. In August, we took possession of the Renaissance O'Hare through a deed-in-lieu transaction and recognized a $4.7 million loss. With hotel occupancy rates continuing to lag normal levels due to reduced travel and government restrictions, in December 2020 we further reduced the valuation of the hotel for our NAV by a total of $7.6 million and reserved $2.25 million due to expected short-term losses projected until the hotel returns to its normal operating levels. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Net Asset Value below. Our review of the property determined the value was not permanently impaired, and we did not reduce the value in our financial statements.\nOur CRE loan portfolio strategy has been to focus on smaller markets and properties owned by experienced and well-capitalized sponsors. Even during the severe market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our strategy as to CRE loans has proven to be effective. We believe the current market conditions create a favorable investment environment for CRE loans and will improve further as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Our target investments provide the opportunity to participate in a CRE market where values have shown positive trends and we believe income growth is expected to continue.\nWe believe the CRE debt sector continues to represent a large market opportunity. According to Trepp - Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data, there are approximately $2.1 trillion in U.S. CRE mortgage loans that are expected to mature during the period 2021 through 2025. We believe the large volume of maturing CRE loans over the next five years and the resulting need for borrowers to refinance assets will provide a significant opportunity to originate CRE debt. In addition, this volume of refinancings does not include the need to finance the purchases of CRE properties, which will provide additional finance opportunities.\nThere continues to be strong competition for CRE lending from banks and non-banking lenders. We believe the many years of industry experience of the portfolio managers of our Sub-advisor who have resulted in long-standing financing relationships will provide us access to attractive loan opportunities to compete in this market.\nPortfolio\nWe began operations in October 2016, and our objective is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio mainly of CRE debt that is primarily floating rate and diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt. We anticipate our investment portfolio will be less diversified and have higher concentrations in asset class, collateral type and geographic location until our capital raise reaches levels that will allow for greater diversification.\nThe charts below summarize our debt investments portfolio as a percentage of par value by type of rate, our total investment portfolio by investment type, and our loan portfolio by collateral type and geographical region as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nFloating Vs.

The changes in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 were primarily due to real estate securities sold during the period. Due to the small number of investments in our portfolio, changes in the portfolio composition may be significant. We anticipate that these changes will become less significant as our portfolio increases in size.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment\nTable 165: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal balance of first mortgage loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 425,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 489,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of first mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal balance of credit loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of credit loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total balance of loans\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 441,696\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 506,402\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total number of loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All-in yield (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average years to maximum maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the size of our portfolio is primarily due to loans that were paid off or sold during the period. The change in the all-in yield was not significant.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total borrowings of $290,699 (which is net of $27 of unamortized debt issuance costs) and $443,294 (which is net of $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs), respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had weighted average borrowings of $378,136 and $329,037 and weighted average borrowing costs of 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was primarily due to the sale of CMBS that were financed under the master repurchase agreements. The value of the CMBS we held was impacted by the overall market decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with those securities representing interests in hospitality property loans being severely impacted. As part of our financing relationships, we were required to meet certain financial covenants and, at times, were required to post additional cash or securities as margin to secure our borrowing positions, and in April 2020, we sold six CMBS positions with values negatively impacted in the wake of the pandemic with a total par value of $63.3 million at a realized loss of $19.3 million. With the continued negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we chose to further reduce exposure to CMBS on a levered basis and sold all of our CMBS securities retaining the cash generated to invest in new loan originations. The decrease in the weighted average borrowing costs was primarily due to the change in LIBOR during the period.\nReal Property\nOn August 20, 2020, through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, we acquired the Renaissance O'Hare from the borrower under one of our first mortgage loans. More specifically, we acquired a ground lease of the Renaissance O'Hare via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction following the borrower's default on its loan, which had a par value of $24.5 million and an initial maturity date of December 9, 2020. Current annual rent under the ground lease is approximately $1.6 million on a net basis, with us as the tenant responsible for all operating expenses, including property taxes. The lease has a 10% rental increase every five years with the next increase scheduled to occur in April 2023. This ground lease runs through March 2098.\nThe Renaissance O'Hare is a full-service, 16-story hotel consisting of the hotel building and access to an adjoining five-story parking garage shared with an adjacent office building we do not own. The hotel features a business center, fitness center, indoor swimming pool and whirlpool, gift shop, restaurant, Starbucks and 170 available parking spaces. The hotel has 16 meeting and banquet rooms containing a total of 15,754 square feet, the largest of which is 5,000 square feet and seats 600.\nAlong with the hospitality sector as a whole, the Renaissance O'Hare was negatively impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to be negatively impacted. The table below includes certain historical information with respect to the average occupancy, the average daily rate and the revenue per available room of the Renaissance O'Hare.\nTable 179: <table> <tr> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Occupancy Per Night\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Average Daily Rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue Per Available Room\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 145.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106.36\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 139.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 104.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 71.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 148.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105.68\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 146.50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 105.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106.81\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe value of the hotel was appraised by a third-party at $21.6 million as of June 29, 2020, and $14 million as of December 31, 2020. We have estimated a $2.25 million expected loss during 2021 for the Renaissance O'Hare related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Though vaccinations have begun, there are numerous risks and uncertainties still surrounding the effects of the pandemic, including whether and when a resumption of pre-pandemic levels of travel and in-person meetings and events might happen. Government restrictions on travel and in-person gatherings, reduced demand for these activities from businesses and individuals, and the uncertainties surrounding the duration and effects of the pandemic persist, so we believe it is prudent to have sought the December appraisal and to have reflected in our NAV as of December 31, 2020 our revised valuation of our interest in the hotel and the estimated loss in 2021 from the continued effects of COVID-19.\nUltimately, we intend to sell the Renaissance O'Hare and remain focused on our core business of investing in CRE debt. The performance of the hotel has trended positively in the first two months of 2021, with average occupancy per night doubling to approximately 32% in February 2021 from approximately 16% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and revenue per available room increasing to $24.32 from $13.60 on a slightly lower average daily rate of $76 from $85. Until we determine to sell the hotel, a third-party management company we have engaged will continue to manage it. To help facilitate operations while we monitor the course of the pandemic and market conditions, the hotel has received a $1.1 million loan under the federal government's paycheck protection program (PPP). Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations and ongoing rulemaking by the U.S. Small Business Administration, based in part on the use of loan proceeds for payroll costs and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs and the maintenance of employee and compensation levels. Our intent is to use the loan proceeds for these purposes, but there is no assurance that our PPP loan will be forgiven.\nAlthough occupancy and the hotel's performance has recently trended positively, balancing the potential increase in the price of a future sale against the potential for continued operating losses in the face of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic is very difficult. Whether we achieve a sale price that is worth waiting for will likely depend in large part on how the aforementioned uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the return of business travel and in-person large group events unfolds, which could result in a favorable sale price or future operating losses even beyond what we are expecting or a loss on sale, any of which could be material to our future results of operations. We will monitor the market for hotel sales while considering, among other things, the performance of the hotel, relevant market factors and our expected total return weighing current potential disposition prices and redeployment of the sales proceeds into our core investment strategy against the potential disposition prices expected later upon the stabilization of the performance of the hotel.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We consider these policies to be critical because they require our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nCommercial Mortgage Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\nCommercial mortgage loans are held for investment purposes and are anticipated to be held until maturity. Accordingly, they are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and premiums or discounts. Commercial mortgage loans that are deemed to be impaired will be carried at amortized cost less a specific allowance for loan losses. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and related discounts, premiums and net deferred fees or costs on investments are amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method. Amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon measurement of impairment, we record an allowance for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We use a uniform process for determining our allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and will include a general, formula-based component when the portfolio is determined to be of sufficient size to warrant such a reserve.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individual impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under\nthe contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on an individual loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nFor collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. The Advisor generally will use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Advisor will obtain external as is\u201d appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist.\nGeneral reserves are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our policy is to estimate loss rates based on actual losses experienced, if any, or based on historic realized losses experienced in the industry if we have not experienced any losses. Current collateral and economic conditions affecting the probability and severity of losses are taken into account when establishing the allowance for loan losses. We perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographic location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from 1\u201d to 5\u201d with 1\u201d representing the lowest risk of loss and 5\u201d representing the highest risk of loss.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed against interest income in the period the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding the borrower's ability to make pending principal and interest payments. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to placing a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates\u201d, which grants smaller reporting companies (as defined by the SEC) until reporting periods commencing after December 15, 2022 to implement ASU 2016-13. The Company has elected to use this extension and is continuing to evaluate the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its allowance for loan losses estimate.\nReal Estate Securities at Fair Value\nOur real estate securities are comprised of CMBS and we have chosen to make a fair value option election pursuant to ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments for our securities and, therefore, our investment securities are recorded at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets. The periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in current period earnings on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) in value of real estate securities. These investments generally meet the requirements to be classified as available-for-sale under ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, which requires the securities to be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. Electing the fair value option permits us to record changes in fair value of our investments in the consolidated statements of operations which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of operations for a particular reporting period.\nWe record our transactions in securities on a trade date basis and recognize realized gains and losses on securities transactions on an identified cost basis.\nResults of Operations\nThe table below presents information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 180:

The increase in real estate owned operating expenses and depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2020 were from the hotel acquired through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction during August 2020. We did not hold any real estate during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in professional service fees in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the write-off of deferred costs related to the issuance of a collateralized loan obligation we did not complete due to the economic impact of COVID-19 and increased legal expenses. Debt finance costs increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the extension fees paid for the CF Repo Facility (defined below) and the addition of the JPM Repo Facility (defined below) in Q2 2019 and the associated amortization of debt finance costs for both in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to higher mortgage servicing fees due to a larger average loan portfolio during 2020 and D&O insurance expense. The expense reimbursement was newly implemented during 2019. The Advisor has agreed to reimburse us from time to time for certain costs incurred by us. There were no expense reimbursements during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018. These reimbursements represent one-time cash payments to us in order to provide additional operating support to us and ensure a particular return for our stockholders and are not subject to approval from our Board. For the year ended December 31, 2020 our total operating expenses were 2.2% of our average invested assets and 45.2% of our net loss. In order to support the performance of the Company, the Advisor has agreed to waive 50% of its management fee for the month of January 2021 and for future months until it notifies our Board that the waiver is terminated.\nOther (Loss) Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, other (loss) income was $(39,910), $989 and $(1,279), respectively. The primary reason for the change in other income (loss) was due to the change in the fair value of the real estate securities resulting from different market conditions during each year, with a significant decrease in value following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December 31, 2020. These real estate securities were all sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was also a provision for loan losses of $(4,726) recorded in 2020 related to the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for the Renaissance O'Hare.\nNet (Loss) Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our net (loss) income was $(28,784) and $13,705, or $(2.49) and $1.53 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The decrease was primarily due to realized losses on the sale of real estate securities and a provision for loan losses recorded during 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our net income was $13,705 and $2,069, or $1.53 and $0.57 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income as our investment portfolio increased due to investing the proceeds from the Offerings and borrowings.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nWe use Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), a widely accepted metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO.\nDue to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives ( IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT.\nThe IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust FFO for certain items, such as amortization of premium and discounts on real estate securities. We purchase real estate securities at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income. We believe that excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows. In addition, we adjust FFO for unrealized gains or losses on real estate securities. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments are based on general market or overall industry conditions and may be temporary in nature.\nBecause MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments.\nOur presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income\u201d or to cash flows from operating activities\u201d as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance.\nNeither the SEC, any other regulatory body nor NAREIT has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, another regulatory body or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nOur FFO and MFFO are calculated as follows:\nTable 189: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,784\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,379\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,069\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of discounts on real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (307\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (808\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (369\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt financing costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,331\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash adjustment for ground lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for loan losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized loss on sale of commercial loan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized (gain) loss on real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (211\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,032\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Realized loss on sale of real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Modified funds from operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,677\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 12,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Asset Value\nPrior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our IPO was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of our common stock in our IPO generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation and any stockholder servicing fees applicable to such class of shares.\nOn March 24, 2020, our Board suspended (i) the sale of shares in our IPO, (ii) the operation of the SRP, (iii) the payment of distributions to our stockholders, and (iv) the operation of the DRP, effective as of April 6, 2020. These changes were made to allow us to maintain fiscal responsibility and respond accordingly to the unprecedented economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In determining to suspend our IPO, the SRP, the payment of distributions and the DRP, our Board considered various factors, including the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, the inability to accurately calculate our NAV per share due to uncertainty, volatility and lack of liquidity in the market, our need for liquidity due to financing challenges related to additional collateral required by the banks that regularly finance our assets and these uncertain and rapidly changing economic conditions.\nAs a result of these factors, we did not calculate our NAV for the months of March through May 2020. We resumed calculation of our NAV beginning as of June 30, 2020 following the Advisor's determination that volatility in the market for our investments had declined and the U.S. economic outlook had improved. In August 2020 we resumed paying distributions monthly to stockholders of record for all classes of shares. On October 1, 2020, the SEC declared effective our post-effective amendment to our registration statement on Form S-11 thereby permitting us to resume offers and sales of shares of common stock in our IPO, including through the DRP.\nOn March 1, 2021, our SRP was reinstated for our stockholders requesting repurchase of shares as a result of the death or qualified disability of the holder. Permitted repurchase requests must be submitted on or after March 1, 2021. The first settlement of permitted repurchase requests will be on March 31, 2021, the last business day of the month.\nOn July 1, 2021, our SRP will be reinstated for all stockholders. Repurchase requests must be submitted on or after July 1, 2021. The first settlement of permitted repurchase requests will be on July 30, 2021, the last business day of the month. In accordance with the terms of the SRP that allow us to repurchase fewer shares than the maximum amount permitted under the SRP, for the months of July, August and September 2021, the total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares (including Class P Shares) will be limited to no more than 1% of our aggregate NAV per month as of the last day of the previous calendar month and no more than 2.5% of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter as of the last day of the previous calendar month. Beginning on October 1, 2021, the total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares will be limited as set forth in the SRP (no more than 2% of our aggregate NAV per month as of the last day of the previous calendar month and no more than 5% of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter as of the last day of the previous calendar month). Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may repurchase fewer shares than these limits in any month, or none. Further, our Board may modify, suspend or terminate our SRP if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders.\nPlease refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 15 - Subsequent Events\u201d and Part I, for additional updates on our business after December 31, 2020.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of December 31, 2020 ($ and shares in thousands):\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> Components of NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 441,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements - commercial mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (290,699\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reserve for negative impact of COVID on real estate owned(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,250\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due to related parties\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,093\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (867\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (292\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accrued stockholder servicing fees(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (49\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other liabilities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,253\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net asset value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 234,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of outstanding shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,638\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> As of December 31, 2020, we established as a component of the NAV calculation a $2.25 million reserve for the expected losses during 2021 for the Renaissance O'Hare related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 192: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, and Class D shares.

As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued under GAAP $723 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class T and Class D shares sold. As of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any Class S shares and, therefore, we have not accrued any stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to Class S shares.

Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of the net proceeds from the Offerings, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, proceeds from the sale of CMBS and one commercial loan provided additional cash.\nWe currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for all anticipated uses, including the acquisition of additional investments, required debt service and the payment of distributions to stockholders.\nCash Flow Analysis\nTable 195: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2020 vs 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2019 vs 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,920\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,850\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing\nactivities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 163,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (317,580\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (283,090\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 481,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (34,490\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by financing\nactivities\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (141,461\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 316,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 306,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (458,105\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,691\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $72,107, $37,639 and $28,497 as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased due to the net proceeds from the Offerings and the net proceeds from the sale of real estate securities.\nOur operating activities generated net cash of $11,998 and $10,078 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net interest income on our investment portfolio. Our operating activities generated net cash of $10,078 and $3,228 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nOur investing activities provided (used) net cash of $163,931 and ($317,580) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the sale of real estate securities during 2020. Our investing activities used $317,580 and $283,090 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Offerings on a levered basis.\nOur financing activities (used) provided net cash of $(141,461) and $316,644 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the repayment of repurchase agreements related to real estate securities that were sold during 2020 and less proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $12,315 greater net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, and $7,383 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing, partially offset by $10,007 greater distributions paid.\nRepurchase Agreements\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nOn February 15, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a master repurchase agreement (the CF Repo Facility\u201d) with Column Financial, Inc. as administrative agent for certain of its affiliates. The CF Repo Facility had an initial advance amount of $100,000 subject to a maximum advance amount of $250,000. We increased the advance amount in August 2018 to $175,000, and in January 2019 to the maximum of $250,000. In March 2020, we increase the maximum advance amount to $300,000 with this increase as amended expiring on June 30, 2020 whereupon the maximum advance amount reverted to $250,000. The initial term of the CF Repo Facility was 12 months and we extended the maturity date in March 2020 to February 2021. During December 2020, the maturity date was further extended to December 2021. Advances under the CF Repo Facility for current loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% with a 0.75% floor. New loans will accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75% with a 0.25% to 0.75% floor. The CF Repo Facility is generally subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2020.\nOn May 6, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an uncommitted master repurchase agreement (the JPM Repo Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The JPM Repo Facility provides up to $150,000 in advances that we expect to use to finance the acquisition or origination of eligible loans and participation interests therein. Advances under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR index rate plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75% to 2.50%, depending on the attributes of the purchased assets. The initial maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility is May 6, 2021, with two successive one-year extensions at our option, which may be exercised upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The JPM Repo Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2020.\nThe JPM Repo Facility and CF Repo Facility (collectively, the Repo Facilities\u201d) are used to finance eligible loans and act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets.\nThe details of the Repo Facilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nTable 196: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Committed\nFinancing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\nOutstanding (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Accrued\nInterest\nPayable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Collateral\nPledged\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Days to\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CF Repo Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 228,359\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.00\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JPM Repo Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 130,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 190,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.08\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 290,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 418,406\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.58\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Weighted Average\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Committed\nFinancing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\nOutstanding (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Accrued\nInterest\nPayable\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Collateral\nPledged\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest\nRate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Days to\nMaturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> CF Repo Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 250,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 224,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 304,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> JPM Repo Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 150,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 111,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 153,194\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.63\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 400,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 335,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 457,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.70\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Excluding $27 and $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReal Estate Securities\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had entered into two master repurchase agreements for real estate securities with separate counterparties and had the following balances outstanding as described in the table below.

The Western Alliance Facility provides for loan advances up to the lesser of $75 million or the borrowing base. The borrowing base consists of eligible assets pledged to and accepted by Western Alliance in its discretion up to the lower of (i) 60% to 70% of loan-to-unpaid balance or (ii) 45% to 50% of the loan-to-appraised value (depending on the property type underlying the asset, for both (i) and (ii)). Assets that would otherwise be eligible become ineligible after being pledged as part of the borrowing base for 36 months.\nWe expect to use advances under the Western Alliance Facility primarily to finance the acquisition or origination of commercial mortgage loans. The Western Alliance Facility is expected to act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our mortgage loan assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets. Advances under the Western Alliance Facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.25% with a floor of 4.0%. The initial maturity date of the Western Alliance Facility is March 10, 2023. We have an option to convert the loan made pursuant to the Western Alliance Facility upon its initial maturity to a term loan with the same interest rate and floor and a maturity of two years in exchange for, among other things, a conversion fee of 0.25% of the outstanding amount at the time of conversion.\nIn connection with the Western Alliance Facility, the Company entered into a guaranty dated March 10, 2021 (the Western Alliance Guaranty\u201d), under which the Company agreed to guarantee all obligations, indebtedness and liabilities of the borrower under the Western Alliance Facility and all related documents and agreements up to 30% of the amount owed under the Western Alliance Facility at the Determination Date plus certain additional amounts specified in the Western Alliance Guaranty, including all advances after the Determination Date. Determination Date\u201d means the earlier of (i) the date Western Alliance issues a written demand for payment under the Western Alliance Guaranty, (ii) the date of maturity of the loan, or (iii) the date upon which Western Alliance elects to accelerate the maturity date of the loan pursuant to the Western Alliance Facility loan documents.\nThe Western Alliance Facility requires maintenance of an average unrestricted aggregate deposit account balance with Western Alliance of not less than $3.75 million. Failure to meet the minimum deposit balance will result in, among other things, the interest rate of the Western Alliance Facility increasing by 0.25% per annum for each quarter in which the compensating balances are not maintained.\nIf the amount of the obligations (excluding interest) exceeds the borrowing base, the borrower must, within 15 days after written notice from Western Alliance (i) pay the difference to Western Alliance or (ii) provide to Western Alliance a lien and security interest in additional collateral acceptable to Western Alliance in its sole and absolute discretion.\nDistributions\nFor the period from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2019, we paid distributions on Class P Shares based on daily record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a daily amount of 1/365th of $1.92 per share. Distributions declared on or after August 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020 on Class P Shares were based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.92 per share.\nFor each class of common stock offered in the IPO through February 29, 2020, we paid the same gross distribution based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.62 per share.\nOn March 24, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Board suspended, among other things, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and the operation of our DRP, effective as of April 6, 2020. In making these decisions, our Board considered the difficulty of confidently determining an NAV as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the extent of the economic effects of the pandemic, as well as the financing challenges related to additional collateral required by the banks that regularly finance our assets. Our Board believed that the responsible course of action in the face of the economic slowdown and uncertainty was to conserve liquidity and prioritize the payment of operating and other essential expenses until the extent of the economic effects of the pandemic could be better understood and analyzed.\nAfter considering, among other things, the reduced volatility in the market for our investments and some improvement in the U.S. economic outlook, on July 30, 2020, our Board authorized a distribution on our common stock that was paid to our stockholders of record as of July 31, 2020. The gross distribution was 1/12th of $0.8576 per share for all classes of shares, and the net distribution was reduced for certain share classes for applicable class-specific expenses. We declared a distribution to stockholders of record as of August 31, 2020 in the gross amount of 1/12th of $0.88 per share for all classes of shares. For stockholders of record as of September 30, 2020, October 31, 2020, November 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, we declared a distribution in the gross amount of 1/12th of $0.90 per share for all classes of shares. For stockholders of record as of January 31, 2021, February 28, 2021 and March 31, 2021, we declared distributions of 1/12th of $0.95 per share, 1/12th of $1.00 per share and 1/12th of $1.05 per share, respectively. The amount of distributions that we may pay in the future is not certain.\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Distributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paid in cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,251\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,333\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reinvested in shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total distributions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows from operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,998\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, none, 38.3% and 49.0% of distributions were paid from the net combined proceeds of our Private Offering and IPO, respectively.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur contractual obligations, excluding expected interest payments, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are summarized as follows:\nTable 202: <table> <tr> <td> As of December 31, 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less than 1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More than 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings under repurchase agreements -\ncommercial mortgage loans (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 290,726\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ground lease (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 271,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 279,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 292,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,222\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 271,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 570,533\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Borrowings under repurchase agreements -

The CF Repo Facility had an initial advance amount of $100,000 subject to a maximum advance amount of $250,000. We increased the advance amount in August 2018 to $175,000, and in January 2019 to the maximum of $250,000. In March 2020, we increase the maximum advance amount to $300,000 with this increase as amended expiring on June 30, 2020 whereupon the maximum advance amount reverted to $250,000. The initial term of the CF Repo Facility was 12 months and we extended the maturity date in March 2020 to February 2021. During December 2020, the maturity date was further extended to December 2021. Advances under the CF Repo Facility for current loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% with a 0.75% floor. New loans will accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75% with a 0.25% to 0.75% floor. The CF Repo Facility is generally subject to certain financial covenants.

Accordingly, they are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and premiums or discounts. Commercial mortgage loans that are deemed to be impaired will be carried at amortized cost less a specific allowance for loan losses. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and related discounts, premiums and net deferred fees or costs on investments are amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method. Amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon measurement of impairment, we record an allowance for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe economic conditions that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our investments during the year ended December 31, 2020. Prior to the pandemic, we held approximately $156.6 million in CMBS of which a significant portion consisted of interests in hotel property loans. The value of the CMBS declined as travel, in-person gatherings and shopping were restricted due to the pandemic. We began selling the CMBS portfolio in April 2020 and, as the effects of the pandemic continued, we eventually made the decision to exit the CMBS market and sold all our CMBS recognizing $35.0 million in losses.\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are set forth in the table below:\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31,

available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our policy is to estimate loss rates based on actual losses experienced, if any, or based on historic realized losses experienced in the industry if we have not experienced any losses. Current collateral and economic conditions affecting the probability and severity of losses are taken into account when establishing the allowance for loan losses. We perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographic location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from 1\u201d to 5\u201d with 1\u201d representing the lowest risk of loss and 5\u201d representing the highest risk of loss.\n \u2022 Under our charter, we may borrow to 300% of our net assets, equivalent to 75% of the costs of our assets and may exceed this limitation with the approval of a majority of our independent directors; \nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2020\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe charts below summarize our debt investments portfolio as a percentage of par value by type of rate, our total investment portfolio by investment type, and our loan portfolio by collateral type and geographical region as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nReal Property\nTable 190: <table> <tr> <td> Components of NAV\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> As of\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 441,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Real estate owned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 72,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Repurchase agreements -

Repurchase requests must be submitted on or after July 1, 2021. The first settlement of permitted repurchase requests will be on July 30, 2021, the last business day of the month. In accordance with the terms of the SRP that allow us to repurchase fewer shares than the maximum amount permitted under the SRP, for the months of July, August and September 2021, the total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares (including Class P Shares) will be limited to no more than 1% of our aggregate NAV per month as of the last day of the previous calendar month and no more than 2.5% of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter as of the last day of the previous calendar month. Beginning on October 1, 2021, the total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares will be limited as set forth in the SRP (no more than 2% of our aggregate NAV per month as of the last day of the previous calendar month and no more than 5% of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter as of the last day of the previous calendar month). Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may repurchase fewer shares than these limits in any month, or none. Further, our Board may modify, suspend or terminate our SRP if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders.\nOn March 24, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Board suspended, among other things, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and the operation of our DRP, effective as of April 6, 2020. In making these decisions, our Board considered the difficulty of confidently determining an NAV as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the extent of the economic effects of the pandemic, as well as the financing challenges related to additional collateral required by the banks that regularly finance our assets. Our Board believed that the responsible course of action in the face of the economic slowdown and uncertainty was to conserve liquidity and prioritize the payment of operating and other essential expenses until the extent of the economic effects of the pandemic could be better understood and analyzed.\n\nOn March 10, 2021, our Operating Partnership entered into a loan and security agreement and a promissory note (collectively the Western Alliance Facility\u201d) with Western Alliance Bank, an Arizona corporation ( Western Alliance\u201d). The Western Alliance Facility provides for loan advances up to the lesser of $75 million or the borrowing base. The borrowing base consists of eligible assets pledged to and accepted by Western Alliance in its discretion up to the lower of (i) 60% to 70% of loan-to-unpaid balance or (ii) 45% to 50% of the loan-to-appraised value (depending on the property type underlying the asset, for both (i) and (ii)). Assets that would otherwise be eligible become ineligible after being pledged as part of the borrowing base for 36 months.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individual impaired loans.

The periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in current period earnings on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) in value of real estate securities. These investments generally meet the requirements to be classified as available-for-sale under ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, which requires the securities to be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. Electing the fair value option permits us to record changes in fair value of our investments in the consolidated statements of operations which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of operations for a particular reporting period.\nTable 176: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Outstanding balance (fair value)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 157,869\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Number of real estate securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average years to maturity\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average yield (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Portfolio ratings % of total outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AAA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> AA-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> BBB-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ____________\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018.

Distributions declared on or after August 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020 on Class P Shares were based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.92 per share.\nWe have made a commitment to advance additional funds under certain of our CRE loans if the borrower meets certain conditions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 20 and 22 CRE loans, respectively, with a total remaining future funding commitment of $50,940 and $54,620, respectively. The future funding commitments are advanced if the borrower has met certain loan specific requirements.\nOverview\nIn connection with the Western Alliance Facility, the Company entered into a guaranty dated March 10, 2021 (the Western Alliance Guaranty\u201d), under which the Company agreed to guarantee all obligations, indebtedness and liabilities of the borrower under the Western Alliance Facility and all related documents and agreements up to 30% of the amount owed under the Western Alliance Facility at the Determination Date plus certain additional amounts specified in the Western Alliance Guaranty, including all advances after the Determination Date. Determination Date\u201d means the earlier of (i) the date Western Alliance issues a written demand for payment under the Western Alliance Guaranty, (ii) the date of maturity of the loan, or (iii) the date upon which Western Alliance elects to accelerate the maturity date of the loan pursuant to the Western Alliance Facility loan documents.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our net (loss) income was $(28,784) and $13,705, or $(2.49) and $1.53 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The decrease was primarily due to realized losses on the sale of real estate securities and a provision for loan losses recorded during 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our net income was $13,705 and $2,069, or $1.53 and $0.57 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income as our investment portfolio increased due to investing the proceeds from the Offerings and borrowings.\nWe currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for all anticipated uses, including the acquisition of additional investments, required debt service and the payment of distributions to stockholders.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of December 31, 2020 ($ and shares in thousands):\nThe allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We use a uniform process for determining our allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and will include a general, formula-based component when the portfolio is determined to be of sufficient size to warrant such a reserve.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\n\n (1) Based on amortized cost for real estate securities and principal amount for repurchase agreements. Amounts are calculated based on the average daily balance. \nUltimately, we intend to sell the Renaissance O'Hare and remain focused on our core business of investing in CRE debt. The performance of the hotel has trended positively in the first two months of 2021, with average occupancy per night doubling to approximately 32% in February 2021 from approximately 16% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and revenue per available room increasing to $24.32 from $13.60 on a slightly lower average daily rate of $76 from $85. Until we determine to sell the hotel, a third-party management company we have engaged will continue to manage it. To help facilitate operations while we monitor the course of the pandemic and market conditions, the hotel has received a $1.1 million loan under the federal government's paycheck protection program (PPP). Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations and ongoing rulemaking by the U.S. Small Business Administration, based in part on the use of loan proceeds for payroll costs and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs and the maintenance of employee and compensation levels. Our intent is to use the loan proceeds for these purposes, but there is no assurance that our PPP loan will be forgiven.\n \u2022 If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions, some or all of our distributions may be paid from other sources, including from the proceeds from sales of our common stock, which will reduce the amount of cash we ultimately have to invest in assets; \n\nThe table below outlines our total NAV and NAV per share by share class as of December 31, 2020 ($ and shares in thousands except for per share data):\nOur CRE loan portfolio has performed well through the pandemic with every loan, other than the loan secured by the Renaissance O'Hare, making all of their scheduled debt service payments during 2020 in accordance with their respective terms, which included modifications to one hospitality loan, one retail loan and two office loans. In August, we took possession of the Renaissance O'Hare through a deed-in-lieu transaction and recognized a $4.7 million loss. With hotel occupancy rates continuing to lag normal levels due to reduced travel and government restrictions, in December 2020 we further reduced the valuation of the hotel for our NAV by a total of $7.6 million and reserved $2.25 million due to expected short-term losses projected until the hotel returns to its normal operating levels. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Net Asset Value below. Our review of the property determined the value was not permanently impaired, and we did not reduce the value in our financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 There is no current public trading market for our common stock, and we do not expect that such a market will ever develop. Therefore, repurchase of shares by us will likely be the only way for stockholders to dispose of their shares, and our SRP was suspended and may be suspended again in the future; \nThere continues to be strong competition for CRE lending from banks and non-banking lenders. We believe the many years of industry experience of the portfolio managers of our Sub-advisor who have resulted in long-standing financing relationships will provide us access to attractive loan opportunities to compete in this market.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, other (loss) income was $(39,910), $989 and $(1,279), respectively. The primary reason for the change in other income (loss) was due to the change in the fair value of the real estate securities resulting from different market conditions during each year, with a significant decrease in value following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December 31, 2020. These real estate securities were all sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was also a provision for loan losses of $(4,726) recorded in 2020 related to the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for the Renaissance O'Hare.\nNet Asset Value\nReview of our Policies\nAfter considering, among other things, the reduced volatility in the market for our investments and some improvement in the U.S. economic outlook, on July 30, 2020, our Board authorized a distribution on our common stock that was paid to our stockholders of record as of July 31, 2020. The gross distribution was 1/12th of $0.8576 per share for all classes of shares, and the net distribution was reduced for certain share classes for applicable class-specific expenses. We declared a distribution to stockholders of record as of August 31, 2020 in the gross amount of 1/12th of $0.88 per share for all classes of shares. For stockholders of record as of September 30, 2020, October 31, 2020, November 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, we declared a distribution in the gross amount of 1/12th of $0.90 per share for all classes of shares. For stockholders of record as of January 31, 2021, February 28, 2021 and March 31, 2021, we declared distributions of 1/12th of $0.95 per share, 1/12th of $1.00 per share and 1/12th of $1.05 per share, respectively. The amount of distributions that we may pay in the future is not certain.\nFor each class of common stock offered in the IPO through February 29, 2020, we paid the same gross distribution based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.62 per share.\n (4) Loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) was determined at loan origination and is not updated for subsequent property valuations or loan modifications. The total is the weighted average LTV. \nThe table below presents information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n \u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant and adverse effect on the economy and our investments, particularly the Renaissance O'Hare, and its future impacts are uncertain and hard to measure but may cause a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \nDecember 31, 2020\nBecause MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments.\nOur contractual obligations, excluding expected interest payments, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are summarized as follows:\n\n\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the timing and amount of capital raised, the composition of our investment portfolio, the amount of leverage applied to our investment portfolio and our net interest income. Several macroeconomic factors impact the interest rate environment and our target assets, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (2) The ground lease was assumed as part of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction on a hotel property during the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\n (1) As of December 31, 2020, we established as a component of the NAV calculation a $2.25 million reserve for the expected losses during 2021 for the Renaissance O'Hare related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. \nResults of Operations\nAs a result of these factors, we did not calculate our NAV for the months of March through May 2020. We resumed calculation of our NAV beginning as of June 30, 2020 following the Advisor's determination that volatility in the market for our investments had declined and the U.S. economic outlook had improved. In August 2020 we resumed paying distributions monthly to stockholders of record for all classes of shares. On October 1, 2020, the SEC declared effective our post-effective amendment to our registration statement on Form S-11 thereby permitting us to resume offers and sales of shares of common stock in our IPO, including through the DRP.\n (3) Interest income excludes $142, $699 and $72 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to bank deposits and Treasury bills not included in the investment portfolio. \nthe contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on an individual loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nThe tables below present select loan information for each of our commercial mortgage loans as of:\n \u2022 If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT, our operations and distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected; and \nTotal operating expenses increased approximately $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in real estate owned operating expenses and professional fees. The increase in real estate owned operating expenses and depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2020 were from the hotel acquired through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction during August 2020. We did not hold any real estate during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in professional service fees in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the write-off of deferred costs related to the issuance of a collateralized loan obligation we did not complete due to the economic impact of COVID-19 and increased legal expenses. Debt finance costs increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the extension fees paid for the CF Repo Facility (defined below) and the addition of the JPM Repo Facility (defined below) in Q2 2019 and the associated amortization of debt finance costs for both in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to higher mortgage servicing fees due to a larger average loan portfolio during 2020 and D&O insurance expense. The expense reimbursement was newly implemented during 2019. The Advisor has agreed to reimburse us from time to time for certain costs incurred by us. There were no expense reimbursements during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018. These reimbursements represent one-time cash payments to us in order to provide additional operating support to us and ensure a particular return for our stockholders and are not subject to approval from our Board. For the year ended December 31, 2020 our total operating expenses were 2.2% of our average invested assets and 45.2% of our net loss. In order to support the performance of the Company, the Advisor has agreed to waive 50% of its management fee for the month of January 2021 and for future months until it notifies our Board that the waiver is terminated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDue to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives ( IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT.\n\nMarket Conditions\n\n (1) Excluding $27 and $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nOur Board, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our registration statement and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders because: (i) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of first mortgage loans secured by CRE and credit loans, thereby reducing risk in our portfolio; (ii) there are sufficient loan underwriting opportunities with the attributes that we seek; (iii) our executive officers, director, affiliates of our Advisor and Sub-Advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments we seek; and (iv) our borrowings will enable us to originate and acquire loan assets and earn revenue more quickly, thereby increasing our likelihood of generating income for our stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We consider these policies to be critical because they require our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\n\nOn March 24, 2020, our Board suspended (i) the sale of shares in our IPO, (ii) the operation of the SRP, (iii) the payment of distributions to our stockholders, and (iv) the operation of the DRP, effective as of April 6, 2020. These changes were made to allow us to maintain fiscal responsibility and respond accordingly to the unprecedented economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In determining to suspend our IPO, the SRP, the payment of distributions and the DRP, our Board considered various factors, including the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, the inability to accurately calculate our NAV per share due to uncertainty, volatility and lack of liquidity in the market, our need for liquidity due to financing challenges related to additional collateral required by the banks that regularly finance our assets and these uncertain and rapidly changing economic conditions.\nOn August 20, 2020, through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, we acquired the Renaissance O'Hare from the borrower under one of our first mortgage loans. More specifically, we acquired a ground lease of the Renaissance O'Hare via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction following the borrower's default on its loan, which had a par value of $24.5 million and an initial maturity date of December 9, 2020. Current annual rent under the ground lease is approximately $1.6 million on a net basis, with us as the tenant responsible for all operating expenses, including property taxes. The lease has a 10% rental increase every five years with the next increase scheduled to occur in April 2023. This ground lease runs through March 2098.\nIf the amount of the obligations (excluding interest) exceeds the borrowing base, the borrower must, within 15 days after written notice from Western Alliance (i) pay the difference to Western Alliance or (ii) provide to Western Alliance a lien and security interest in additional collateral acceptable to Western Alliance in its sole and absolute discretion.\nOn March 1, 2021, our SRP was reinstated for our stockholders requesting repurchase of shares as a result of the death or qualified disability of the holder. Permitted repurchase requests must be submitted on or after March 1, 2021. The first settlement of permitted repurchase requests will be on March 31, 2021, the last business day of the month.\n \u2022 Even if our stockholders are able to sell their shares pursuant to our SRP, or otherwise, they may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares; \nOur operating activities generated net cash of $11,998 and $10,078 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net interest income on our investment portfolio. Our operating activities generated net cash of $10,078 and $3,228 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nThe JPM Repo Facility and CF Repo Facility (collectively, the Repo Facilities\u201d) are used to finance eligible loans and act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed against interest income in the period the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding the borrower's ability to make pending principal and interest payments. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to placing a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\n\nCash Flow Analysis\nWe held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $72,107, $37,639 and $28,497 as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased due to the net proceeds from the Offerings and the net proceeds from the sale of real estate securities.\n\n (3) Maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower, however loans may be repaid prior to such date. \n (6) Calculated by taking the sum of (i) the net interest spread multiplied by the average leverage and (ii) the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets. \nThe value of the hotel was appraised by a third-party at $21.6 million as of June 29, 2020, and $14 million as of December 31, 2020. We have estimated a $2.25 million expected loss during 2021 for the Renaissance O'Hare related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Though vaccinations have begun, there are numerous risks and uncertainties still surrounding the effects of the pandemic, including whether and when a resumption of pre-pandemic levels of travel and in-person meetings and events might happen. Government restrictions on travel and in-person gatherings, reduced demand for these activities from businesses and individuals, and the uncertainties surrounding the duration and effects of the pandemic persist, so we believe it is prudent to have sought the December appraisal and to have reflected in our NAV as of December 31, 2020 our revised valuation of our interest in the hotel and the estimated loss in 2021 from the continued effects of COVID-19.\nThe details of the Repo Facilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, none, 38.3% and 49.0% of distributions were paid from the net combined proceeds of our Private Offering and IPO, respectively. \nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nThe decrease in the size of our portfolio is primarily due to loans that were paid off or sold during the period. The change in the all-in yield was not significant. The portfolio has not grown during 2020 due to the desire to preserve cash during the early period of the pandemic and the temporary suspension of our IPO.\nPlease refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 15 - Subsequent Events\u201d and Part I, for additional updates on our business after December 31, 2020.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n (1) First mortgage loans are first position mortgage loans and credit loans are mezzanine and subordinated loans. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we raised combined gross proceeds from the Private Offering and IPO (collectively, the Offerings\u201d), including proceeds from the DRP, of $24,513 and $130,201, respectively. The changes in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 were primarily due to real estate securities sold during the period. Due to the small number of investments in our portfolio, changes in the portfolio composition may be significant. We anticipate that these changes will become less significant as our portfolio increases in size.\nFloating Vs. Fixed Rate Debt Investments:\nOn May 6, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an uncommitted master repurchase agreement (the JPM Repo Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The JPM Repo Facility provides up to $150,000 in advances that we expect to use to finance the acquisition or origination of eligible loans and participation interests therein. Advances under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR index rate plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75% to 2.50%, depending on the attributes of the purchased assets. The initial maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility is May 6, 2021, with two successive one-year extensions at our option, which may be exercised upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The JPM Repo Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2020.\n (2) Includes the effect of amortization of premium or accretion of discount. \nNet Interest Income\nThe Renaissance O'Hare is a full-service, 16-story hotel consisting of the hotel building and access to an adjoining five-story parking garage shared with an adjacent office building we do not own. The hotel features a business center, fitness center, indoor swimming pool and whirlpool, gift shop, restaurant, Starbucks and 170 available parking spaces. The hotel has 16 meeting and banquet rooms containing a total of 15,754 square feet, the largest of which is 5,000 square feet and seats 600.\n (7) Cash coupon increased to L+5.30% on the payment date in January 2020. \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nWe began operations in October 2016, and our objective is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio mainly of CRE debt that is primarily floating rate and diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt. We anticipate our investment portfolio will be less diversified and have higher concentrations in asset class, collateral type and geographic location until our capital raise reaches levels that will allow for greater diversification.\n (6) Loan has been modified to capitalize a portion of its interest payment for a temporary period of time. The all-in yield assumes the timely payment of interest and principal through maturity. \nAlong with the hospitality sector as a whole, the Renaissance O'Hare was negatively impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to be negatively impacted. The table below includes certain historical information with respect to the average occupancy, the average daily rate and the revenue per available room of the Renaissance O'Hare.\n \u2022 None of our agreements with our Advisor, our Sub-Advisor or any affiliates of our Advisor or Sub-Advisor were negotiated at arm's-length; \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had entered into two master repurchase agreements for real estate securities with separate counterparties and had the following balances outstanding as described in the table below. As of December 31, 2020, we repaid all borrowings under the master repurchase agreements and had no balances outstanding.\n\nOur financing activities (used) provided net cash of $(141,461) and $316,644 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the repayment of repurchase agreements related to real estate securities that were sold during 2020 and less proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $12,315 greater net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, and $7,383 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing, partially offset by $10,007 greater distributions paid.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust FFO for certain items, such as amortization of premium and discounts on real estate securities. We purchase real estate securities at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income. We believe that excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows. In addition, we adjust FFO for unrealized gains or losses on real estate securities. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments are based on general market or overall industry conditions and may be temporary in nature.\nFor collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. The Advisor generally will use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Advisor will obtain external as is\u201d appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist.\nNet interest income is generated on our interest-earning assets less related interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the average balance of interest-earning assets less related interest-bearing liabilities, associated interest income and expense and corresponding yield earned and incurred for the periods indicated.\nLoans by Property Type:\n\n (1) All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees. \nOperating Expenses\n (4) Calculated as interest income or expense divided by average carrying value. \nWe expect to use advances under the Western Alliance Facility primarily to finance the acquisition or origination of commercial mortgage loans. The Western Alliance Facility is expected to act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our mortgage loan assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets. Advances under the Western Alliance Facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.25% with a floor of 4.0%. The initial maturity date of the Western Alliance Facility is March 10, 2023. We have an option to convert the loan made pursuant to the Western Alliance Facility upon its initial maturity to a term loan with the same interest rate and floor and a maturity of two years in exchange for, among other things, a conversion fee of 0.25% of the outstanding amount at the time of conversion.\n (5) Risk rating is the internal risk rating assigned by the Sub-Advisor. The total is the average rating for the portfolio. See Note 3 - Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment,\" which is included in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (1) The weighted average interest rate is based off the balance of the bonds outstanding and the applicable rates. \nWe believe the CRE debt sector continues to represent a large market opportunity. According to Trepp - Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data, there are approximately $2.1 trillion in U.S. CRE mortgage loans that are expected to mature during the period 2021 through 2025. We believe the large volume of maturing CRE loans over the next five years and the resulting need for borrowers to refinance assets will provide a significant opportunity to originate CRE debt. In addition, this volume of refinancings does not include the need to finance the purchases of CRE properties, which will provide additional finance opportunities.\nRepurchase Agreements\nPortfolio\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are stated in thousands, except share data.\nWe use Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), a widely accepted metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO.\nAlthough occupancy and the hotel's performance has recently trended positively, balancing the potential increase in the price of a future sale against the potential for continued operating losses in the face of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic is very difficult. Whether we achieve a sale price that is worth waiting for will likely depend in large part on how the aforementioned uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the return of business travel and in-person large group events unfolds, which could result in a favorable sale price or future operating losses even beyond what we are expecting or a loss on sale, any of which could be material to our future results of operations. We will monitor the market for hotel sales while considering, among other things, the performance of the hotel, relevant market factors and our expected total return weighing current potential disposition prices and redeployment of the sales proceeds into our core investment strategy against the potential disposition prices expected later upon the stabilization of the performance of the hotel.\nRevenue from Real Estate Owned\nFor a discussion of the history of the Company and its Private Offering and IPO, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 1 - Organization and Business Operations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements below.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n (5) Calculated by dividing total average interest-bearing liabilities by total average equity (total average interest-earning assets less total average liabilities). \nOur CRE loan portfolio strategy has been to focus on smaller markets and properties owned by experienced and well-capitalized sponsors. Even during the severe market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our strategy as to CRE loans has proven to be effective. We believe the current market conditions create a favorable investment environment for CRE loans and will improve further as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Our target investments provide the opportunity to participate in a CRE market where values have shown positive trends and we believe income growth is expected to continue.\nOur investing activities provided (used) net cash of $163,931 and ($317,580) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the sale of real estate securities during 2020. Our investing activities used $317,580 and $283,090 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Offerings on a levered basis.\nThe following table reconciles stockholders' equity per our consolidated balance sheet to our NAV:\n (2) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, and Class D shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the full cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class T, Class S and Class D shares. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued under GAAP $723 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class T and Class D shares sold. As of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any Class S shares and, therefore, we have not accrued any stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to Class S shares. The Dealer Manager does not retain any of these fees, all of which are retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating dealers and servicing broker-dealers for ongoing stockholder services performed by such broker-dealers. \nOur FFO and MFFO are calculated as follows:\nWe entered into master repurchase agreements to fund our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total borrowings of $290,699 (which is net of $27 of unamortized debt issuance costs) and $443,294 (which is net of $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs), respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had weighted average borrowings of $378,136 and $329,037 and weighted average borrowing costs of 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was primarily due to the sale of CMBS that were financed under the master repurchase agreements. The value of the CMBS we held was impacted by the overall market decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with those securities representing interests in hospitality property loans being severely impacted. As part of our financing relationships, we were required to meet certain financial covenants and, at times, were required to post additional cash or securities as margin to secure our borrowing positions, and in April 2020, we sold six CMBS positions with values negatively impacted in the wake of the pandemic with a total par value of $63.3 million at a realized loss of $19.3 million. With the continued negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we chose to further reduce exposure to CMBS on a levered basis and sold all of our CMBS securities retaining the cash generated to invest in new loan originations. The decrease in the weighted average borrowing costs was primarily due to the change in LIBOR during the period.\nOur presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income\u201d or to cash flows from operating activities\u201d as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance.\n\n\nPrior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our IPO was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of our common stock in our IPO generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation and any stockholder servicing fees applicable to such class of shares.\nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results", "item_7_text": "Neither the SEC, any other regulatory body nor NAREIT has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO or MFFO. In the future, the SEC, another regulatory body or NAREIT may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.\nNet (Loss) Income\nThe change in performance from December 31, 2019 to the year ended December 31, 2020 generally resulted from decrease in value of CMBS following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and losses on real estate acquired via deed-in-lieu of foreclosure, offset partially from the investment of the proceeds from the Offerings in CRE investments on a levered basis. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the ratio of the cost of raising equity capital to the gross amount of equity capital raised was approximately 9.3%.\nOn February 15, 2018, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a master repurchase agreement (the CF Repo Facility\u201d) with Column Financial, Inc. as administrative agent for certain of its affiliates. The CF Repo Facility had an initial advance amount of $100,000 subject to a maximum advance amount of $250,000. We increased the advance amount in August 2018 to $175,000, and in January 2019 to the maximum of $250,000. In March 2020, we increase the maximum advance amount to $300,000 with this increase as amended expiring on June 30, 2020 whereupon the maximum advance amount reverted to $250,000. The initial term of the CF Repo Facility was 12 months and we extended the maturity date in March 2020 to February 2021. During December 2020, the maturity date was further extended to December 2021. Advances under the CF Repo Facility for current loans accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% with a 0.75% floor. New loans will accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to LIBOR plus 2.25% to 2.75% with a 0.25% to 0.75% floor. The CF Repo Facility is generally subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2020.\nLoans by Region:\nDecember 31, 2019\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we acquired a hotel property through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction that generated $972 in revenue. We did not own any real estate during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nReal Estate Securities at Fair Value\n (2) The weighted average yield is calculated as interest income divided by the average carrying value. \nReal Estate Securities\nOther (Loss) Income\nWe record our transactions in securities on a trade date basis and recognize realized gains and losses on securities transactions on an identified cost basis.\nThe increase in our average interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities was due to the investment of proceeds from the Offerings and through increased leverage as we executed our business strategy. The change in the weighted average yield and finance cost was due to the change in the portfolio composition between securities and mortgage loans and the changes in interest rates tied to LIBOR.\nReal Estate Securities\n\nCommercial mortgage loans are held for investment purposes and are anticipated to be held until maturity. Accordingly, they are carried at cost, net of unamortized loan fees and origination costs, and premiums or discounts. Commercial mortgage loans that are deemed to be impaired will be carried at amortized cost less a specific allowance for loan losses. Interest income is recorded on the accrual basis and related discounts, premiums and net deferred fees or costs on investments are amortized over the life of the investment using the effective interest method. Amortization is reflected as an adjustment to interest income in our consolidated statements of operations. Upon measurement of impairment, we record an allowance for loan losses to reduce the carrying value of the loan with a corresponding charge through the provision for loan losses on our consolidated statements of operations.\nThe economic conditions that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on our investments during the year ended December 31, 2020. Prior to the pandemic, we held approximately $156.6 million in CMBS of which a significant portion consisted of interests in hotel property loans. The value of the CMBS declined as travel, in-person gatherings and shopping were restricted due to the pandemic. We began selling the CMBS portfolio in April 2020 and, as the effects of the pandemic continued, we eventually made the decision to exit the CMBS market and sold all our CMBS recognizing $35.0 million in losses.\nOperating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are set forth in the table below:\nDistributions\nAll Investments by Type:\nGeneral reserves are recorded when (i) available information as of each balance sheet date indicates that it is probable a loss has occurred in the portfolio and (ii) the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Our policy is to estimate loss rates based on actual losses experienced, if any, or based on historic realized losses experienced in the industry if we have not experienced any losses. Current collateral and economic conditions affecting the probability and severity of losses are taken into account when establishing the allowance for loan losses. We perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management's current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability. We consider, among other things, payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographic location as well as national and regional economic factors. This methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss. Ratings range from 1\u201d to 5\u201d with 1\u201d representing the lowest risk of loss and 5\u201d representing the highest risk of loss.\n \u2022 Under our charter, we may borrow to 300% of our net assets, equivalent to 75% of the costs of our assets and may exceed this limitation with the approval of a majority of our independent directors; \nThe charts below summarize our debt investments portfolio as a percentage of par value by type of rate, our total investment portfolio by investment type, and our loan portfolio by collateral type and geographical region as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nReal Property\nCommercial Mortgage Loans\nAn investment's region is defined according to the below map based on the location of underlying property.\nCertain statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act\u201d). Words such as may,\u201d could,\u201d should,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d goal,\u201d seek,\u201d anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d predict,\u201d variables,\u201d potential,\u201d continue,\u201d expand,\u201d maintain,\u201d create,\u201d strategies,\u201d likely,\u201d will,\u201d would\u201d and variations of these terms and similar expressions, or the negative of these terms or similar expressions, are intended to identify forward-looking statements.\nOn July 1, 2021, our SRP will be reinstated for all stockholders. Repurchase requests must be submitted on or after July 1, 2021. The first settlement of permitted repurchase requests will be on July 30, 2021, the last business day of the month. In accordance with the terms of the SRP that allow us to repurchase fewer shares than the maximum amount permitted under the SRP, for the months of July, August and September 2021, the total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares (including Class P Shares) will be limited to no more than 1% of our aggregate NAV per month as of the last day of the previous calendar month and no more than 2.5% of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter as of the last day of the previous calendar month. Beginning on October 1, 2021, the total amount of aggregate repurchases of shares will be limited as set forth in the SRP (no more than 2% of our aggregate NAV per month as of the last day of the previous calendar month and no more than 5% of our aggregate NAV per calendar quarter as of the last day of the previous calendar month). Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may repurchase fewer shares than these limits in any month, or none. Further, our Board may modify, suspend or terminate our SRP if it deems such action to be in our best interest and the best interest of our stockholders.\nOn March 24, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Board suspended, among other things, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and the operation of our DRP, effective as of April 6, 2020. In making these decisions, our Board considered the difficulty of confidently determining an NAV as a result of the uncertainty surrounding the extent of the economic effects of the pandemic, as well as the financing challenges related to additional collateral required by the banks that regularly finance our assets. Our Board believed that the responsible course of action in the face of the economic slowdown and uncertainty was to conserve liquidity and prioritize the payment of operating and other essential expenses until the extent of the economic effects of the pandemic could be better understood and analyzed.\n\nOn March 10, 2021, our Operating Partnership entered into a loan and security agreement and a promissory note (collectively the Western Alliance Facility\u201d) with Western Alliance Bank, an Arizona corporation ( Western Alliance\u201d). The Western Alliance Facility provides for loan advances up to the lesser of $75 million or the borrowing base. The borrowing base consists of eligible assets pledged to and accepted by Western Alliance in its discretion up to the lower of (i) 60% to 70% of loan-to-unpaid balance or (ii) 45% to 50% of the loan-to-appraised value (depending on the property type underlying the asset, for both (i) and (ii)). Assets that would otherwise be eligible become ineligible after being pledged as part of the borrowing base for 36 months.\nThe asset-specific reserve component relates to reserves for losses on individual impaired loans. We consider a loan to be impaired when, based upon current information and events, we believe that it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due under\nWe have operated in a manner that allows us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2017. Among other requirements, REITs are required to distribute to stockholders at least 90% of their annual REIT taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends-paid deduction and excluding net capital gain).\nThe change in performance from December 31, 2018 to the year ended December 31, 2019 generally resulted from the investment of the proceeds from the Private Offering in CRE investments on a levered basis.\nOur real estate securities are comprised of CMBS and we have chosen to make a fair value option election pursuant to ASC Topic 825, Financial Instruments for our securities and, therefore, our investment securities are recorded at fair market value on the consolidated balance sheets. The periodic changes in fair market value are recorded in current period earnings on the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net unrealized gain (loss) in value of real estate securities. These investments generally meet the requirements to be classified as available-for-sale under ASC Topic 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities, which requires the securities to be carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with changes in fair value recorded to other comprehensive income on our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders' equity. Electing the fair value option permits us to record changes in fair value of our investments in the consolidated statements of operations which, in management's view, more appropriately reflects the results of operations for a particular reporting period.\nIn June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASU 2016-13\u201d), which changes how entities measure credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost. ASU 2016-13 eliminates the requirement that a credit loss must be probable before it can be recognized and instead requires an entity to recognize the current estimate of all expected credit losses. ASU 2016-13 is effective for SEC filers for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The amendments may be adopted early for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018. In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-10, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842): Effective Dates\u201d, which grants smaller reporting companies (as defined by the SEC) until reporting periods commencing after December 15, 2022 to implement ASU 2016-13. The Company has elected to use this extension and is continuing to evaluate the impact ASU 2016-13 will have on its allowance for loan losses estimate.\nThe Western Alliance Facility requires maintenance of an average unrestricted aggregate deposit account balance with Western Alliance of not less than $3.75 million. Failure to meet the minimum deposit balance will result in, among other things, the interest rate of the Western Alliance Facility increasing by 0.25% per annum for each quarter in which the compensating balances are not maintained.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold all CMBS investments. The table below provides a summary of our real estate securities portfolio as of December 31, 2019:\nForward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect our management's view only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false. We undertake no obligation to update or revise forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results except as required by applicable law. We intend for these forward-looking statements to be covered by the applicable safe harbor provisions created by Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act.\n (2) Cash coupon is the stated rate on the loan. All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees. The total is the weighted average rate as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our first mortgage loans are all floating rate and each contains a minimum LIBOR floor. The weighted average LIBOR floor for these loans was 1.83% and 1.93% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \n\n\nCommercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment\nLiquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay distributions to our stockholders, fund investments, originate loans, repay borrowings, and other general business needs including the payment of our operating and administrative expenses. Our primary sources of funds for liquidity consist of the net proceeds from the Offerings, net cash provided by operating activities, proceeds from repurchase agreements and other financing arrangements and future issuances of equity and/or debt securities. During the year ended December 31, 2020, proceeds from the sale of CMBS and one commercial loan provided additional cash.\n\nThese forward-looking statements are not historical facts but reflect the intent, belief or current expectations of our management based on their knowledge and understanding of the business and industry, the economy and other future conditions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and we caution stockholders not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, including but not limited to the factors described below:\nWe are a Maryland corporation formed on September 13, 2016 to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio of CRE investments primarily comprised of (i) CRE debt, including floating-rate first mortgage loans, subordinate mortgage and mezzanine loans, and participations in such loans and (ii) floating-rate CRE securities such as CMBS and senior unsecured debt of publicly traded REITs. We may also invest in select equity investments in single-tenant, net leased properties. Substantially all of our business is conducted through our Operating Partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We are externally managed by our Advisor, an indirect subsidiary of Inland Real Estate Investment Corporation. Our Advisor has engaged the Sub-Advisor, a subsidiary of Sound Point CRE Management, LP, to perform certain services on behalf of the Advisor for us.\nWestern Alliance Warehouse Facility\n (1) Excluding $27 and $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \n \u2022 Market disruptions caused by the economic effects of, or uncertainties surrounding the future effects of, the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely impacted aspects of our operating results and operating condition and may continue to do so, and these effects may become more severe, e.g., if COVID-19 vaccinations are not as effective as expected or for some other reason COVID-19 cases increase nationally or in markets that affect the value of our investments; \n \u2022 Our Advisor and Sub-Advisor may face conflicts of interest in allocating personnel and resources among us and their affiliates; \nFor the period from January 1, 2019 to July 31, 2019, we paid distributions on Class P Shares based on daily record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a daily amount of 1/365th of $1.92 per share. Distributions declared on or after August 1, 2019 through February 29, 2020 on Class P Shares were based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.92 per share.\nWe have made a commitment to advance additional funds under certain of our CRE loans if the borrower meets certain conditions. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had 20 and 22 CRE loans, respectively, with a total remaining future funding commitment of $50,940 and $54,620, respectively. The future funding commitments are advanced if the borrower has met certain loan specific requirements.\nOverview\nIn connection with the Western Alliance Facility, the Company entered into a guaranty dated March 10, 2021 (the Western Alliance Guaranty\u201d), under which the Company agreed to guarantee all obligations, indebtedness and liabilities of the borrower under the Western Alliance Facility and all related documents and agreements up to 30% of the amount owed under the Western Alliance Facility at the Determination Date plus certain additional amounts specified in the Western Alliance Guaranty, including all advances after the Determination Date. Determination Date\u201d means the earlier of (i) the date Western Alliance issues a written demand for payment under the Western Alliance Guaranty, (ii) the date of maturity of the loan, or (iii) the date upon which Western Alliance elects to accelerate the maturity date of the loan pursuant to the Western Alliance Facility loan documents.\n\nCommercial Mortgage Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, our net (loss) income was $(28,784) and $13,705, or $(2.49) and $1.53 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The decrease was primarily due to realized losses on the sale of real estate securities and a provision for loan losses recorded during 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our net income was $13,705 and $2,069, or $1.53 and $0.57 per share (basic and diluted), respectively. The increase in net income was primarily due to an increase in net interest income as our investment portfolio increased due to investing the proceeds from the Offerings and borrowings.\nWe currently believe that we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources available for all anticipated uses, including the acquisition of additional investments, required debt service and the payment of distributions to stockholders.\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the major components of our NAV as of December 31, 2020 ($ and shares in thousands):\nThe allowance for loan losses reflects management's estimate of loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date. We use a uniform process for determining our allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses includes an asset-specific component and will include a general, formula-based component when the portfolio is determined to be of sufficient size to warrant such a reserve.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\n\n (1) Based on amortized cost for real estate securities and principal amount for repurchase agreements. Amounts are calculated based on the average daily balance. \nUltimately, we intend to sell the Renaissance O'Hare and remain focused on our core business of investing in CRE debt. The performance of the hotel has trended positively in the first two months of 2021, with average occupancy per night doubling to approximately 32% in February 2021 from approximately 16% in the fourth quarter of 2020 and revenue per available room increasing to $24.32 from $13.60 on a slightly lower average daily rate of $76 from $85. Until we determine to sell the hotel, a third-party management company we have engaged will continue to manage it. To help facilitate operations while we monitor the course of the pandemic and market conditions, the hotel has received a $1.1 million loan under the federal government's paycheck protection program (PPP). Under the terms of the CARES Act, PPP loan recipients can apply for forgiveness for all or a portion of loans granted under the PPP. Such forgiveness will be determined, subject to limitations and ongoing rulemaking by the U.S. Small Business Administration, based in part on the use of loan proceeds for payroll costs and mortgage interest, rent or utility costs and the maintenance of employee and compensation levels. Our intent is to use the loan proceeds for these purposes, but there is no assurance that our PPP loan will be forgiven.\n \u2022 If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fully fund distributions, some or all of our distributions may be paid from other sources, including from the proceeds from sales of our common stock, which will reduce the amount of cash we ultimately have to invest in assets; \n\nThe table below outlines our total NAV and NAV per share by share class as of December 31, 2020 ($ and shares in thousands except for per share data):\nOur CRE loan portfolio has performed well through the pandemic with every loan, other than the loan secured by the Renaissance O'Hare, making all of their scheduled debt service payments during 2020 in accordance with their respective terms, which included modifications to one hospitality loan, one retail loan and two office loans. In August, we took possession of the Renaissance O'Hare through a deed-in-lieu transaction and recognized a $4.7 million loss. With hotel occupancy rates continuing to lag normal levels due to reduced travel and government restrictions, in December 2020 we further reduced the valuation of the hotel for our NAV by a total of $7.6 million and reserved $2.25 million due to expected short-term losses projected until the hotel returns to its normal operating levels. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures - Net Asset Value below. Our review of the property determined the value was not permanently impaired, and we did not reduce the value in our financial statements.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\n \u2022 There is no current public trading market for our common stock, and we do not expect that such a market will ever develop. Therefore, repurchase of shares by us will likely be the only way for stockholders to dispose of their shares, and our SRP was suspended and may be suspended again in the future; \nThere continues to be strong competition for CRE lending from banks and non-banking lenders. We believe the many years of industry experience of the portfolio managers of our Sub-advisor who have resulted in long-standing financing relationships will provide us access to attractive loan opportunities to compete in this market.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, other (loss) income was $(39,910), $989 and $(1,279), respectively. The primary reason for the change in other income (loss) was due to the change in the fair value of the real estate securities resulting from different market conditions during each year, with a significant decrease in value following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended December 31, 2020. These real estate securities were all sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. There was also a provision for loan losses of $(4,726) recorded in 2020 related to the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure for the Renaissance O'Hare.\nNet Asset Value\nReview of our Policies\nAfter considering, among other things, the reduced volatility in the market for our investments and some improvement in the U.S. economic outlook, on July 30, 2020, our Board authorized a distribution on our common stock that was paid to our stockholders of record as of July 31, 2020. The gross distribution was 1/12th of $0.8576 per share for all classes of shares, and the net distribution was reduced for certain share classes for applicable class-specific expenses. We declared a distribution to stockholders of record as of August 31, 2020 in the gross amount of 1/12th of $0.88 per share for all classes of shares. For stockholders of record as of September 30, 2020, October 31, 2020, November 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, we declared a distribution in the gross amount of 1/12th of $0.90 per share for all classes of shares. For stockholders of record as of January 31, 2021, February 28, 2021 and March 31, 2021, we declared distributions of 1/12th of $0.95 per share, 1/12th of $1.00 per share and 1/12th of $1.05 per share, respectively. The amount of distributions that we may pay in the future is not certain.\nFor each class of common stock offered in the IPO through February 29, 2020, we paid the same gross distribution based on monthly record dates, payable in arrears the following month, equal to a monthly amount of 1/12th of $1.62 per share.\n (4) Loan-to-value ( LTV\u201d) was determined at loan origination and is not updated for subsequent property valuations or loan modifications. The total is the weighted average LTV. \nThe table below presents information from our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\n \u2022 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant and adverse effect on the economy and our investments, particularly the Renaissance O'Hare, and its future impacts are uncertain and hard to measure but may cause a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. \nDecember 31, 2020\nBecause MFFO may be a recognized measure of operating performance within the non-listed REIT industry, MFFO and the adjustments used to calculate it may be useful in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. Like FFO, MFFO is not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, as detailed in the table below, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance on value if we continue to acquire a significant amount of investments.\nOur contractual obligations, excluding expected interest payments, as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 are summarized as follows:\n\n\nOur operating results can be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on the timing and amount of capital raised, the composition of our investment portfolio, the amount of leverage applied to our investment portfolio and our net interest income. Several macroeconomic factors impact the interest rate environment and our target assets, none of which can be predicted with any certainty.\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n (2) The ground lease was assumed as part of a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction on a hotel property during the year ended December 31, 2020. \n\n (1) As of December 31, 2020, we established as a component of the NAV calculation a $2.25 million reserve for the expected losses during 2021 for the Renaissance O'Hare related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. \nResults of Operations\nAs a result of these factors, we did not calculate our NAV for the months of March through May 2020. We resumed calculation of our NAV beginning as of June 30, 2020 following the Advisor's determination that volatility in the market for our investments had declined and the U.S. economic outlook had improved. In August 2020 we resumed paying distributions monthly to stockholders of record for all classes of shares. On October 1, 2020, the SEC declared effective our post-effective amendment to our registration statement on Form S-11 thereby permitting us to resume offers and sales of shares of common stock in our IPO, including through the DRP.\n (3) Interest income excludes $142, $699 and $72 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to bank deposits and Treasury bills not included in the investment portfolio. \nthe contractual terms of the loan agreement. This assessment is made on an individual loan basis each quarter based on such factors as payment status, lien position, borrower financial resources and investment in collateral, collateral type, project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors. A reserve is established for an impaired loan when the present value of payments expected to be received, observable market prices or the estimated fair value of the collateral (for loans that are dependent on the collateral for repayment) is lower than the carrying value of that loan.\nThe tables below present select loan information for each of our commercial mortgage loans as of:\n \u2022 If we fail to continue to qualify as a REIT, our operations and distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected; and \nTotal operating expenses increased approximately $5.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to the increase in real estate owned operating expenses and professional fees. The increase in real estate owned operating expenses and depreciation and amortization during the year ended December 31, 2020 were from the hotel acquired through a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction during August 2020. We did not hold any real estate during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The increase in professional service fees in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to the write-off of deferred costs related to the issuance of a collateralized loan obligation we did not complete due to the economic impact of COVID-19 and increased legal expenses. Debt finance costs increased during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the extension fees paid for the CF Repo Facility (defined below) and the addition of the JPM Repo Facility (defined below) in Q2 2019 and the associated amortization of debt finance costs for both in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase in other expenses during the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to higher mortgage servicing fees due to a larger average loan portfolio during 2020 and D&O insurance expense. The expense reimbursement was newly implemented during 2019. The Advisor has agreed to reimburse us from time to time for certain costs incurred by us. There were no expense reimbursements during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2018. These reimbursements represent one-time cash payments to us in order to provide additional operating support to us and ensure a particular return for our stockholders and are not subject to approval from our Board. For the year ended December 31, 2020 our total operating expenses were 2.2% of our average invested assets and 45.2% of our net loss. In order to support the performance of the Company, the Advisor has agreed to waive 50% of its management fee for the month of January 2021 and for future months until it notifies our Board that the waiver is terminated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDue to the unique features of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the Institute for Portfolio Alternatives ( IPA\u201d), an industry trade group, published a standardized measure known as Modified Funds from Operations ( MFFO\u201d), which the IPA has promulgated as a supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which may be another appropriate supplemental measure to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT.\n\nMarket Conditions\n\n (1) Excluding $27 and $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. \nOur Board, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our registration statement and determined that they are in the best interests of our stockholders because: (i) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to originate, acquire and manage a diversified portfolio of first mortgage loans secured by CRE and credit loans, thereby reducing risk in our portfolio; (ii) there are sufficient loan underwriting opportunities with the attributes that we seek; (iii) our executive officers, director, affiliates of our Advisor and Sub-Advisor have expertise with the type of real estate investments we seek; and (iv) our borrowings will enable us to originate and acquire loan assets and earn revenue more quickly, thereby increasing our likelihood of generating income for our stockholders and preserving stockholder capital.\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. We consider these policies to be critical because they require our management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. If management's judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\n\nOn March 24, 2020, our Board suspended (i) the sale of shares in our IPO, (ii) the operation of the SRP, (iii) the payment of distributions to our stockholders, and (iv) the operation of the DRP, effective as of April 6, 2020. These changes were made to allow us to maintain fiscal responsibility and respond accordingly to the unprecedented economic disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In determining to suspend our IPO, the SRP, the payment of distributions and the DRP, our Board considered various factors, including the impact of the global COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, the inability to accurately calculate our NAV per share due to uncertainty, volatility and lack of liquidity in the market, our need for liquidity due to financing challenges related to additional collateral required by the banks that regularly finance our assets and these uncertain and rapidly changing economic conditions.\nOn August 20, 2020, through an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, we acquired the Renaissance O'Hare from the borrower under one of our first mortgage loans. More specifically, we acquired a ground lease of the Renaissance O'Hare via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure transaction following the borrower's default on its loan, which had a par value of $24.5 million and an initial maturity date of December 9, 2020. Current annual rent under the ground lease is approximately $1.6 million on a net basis, with us as the tenant responsible for all operating expenses, including property taxes. The lease has a 10% rental increase every five years with the next increase scheduled to occur in April 2023. This ground lease runs through March 2098.\nIf the amount of the obligations (excluding interest) exceeds the borrowing base, the borrower must, within 15 days after written notice from Western Alliance (i) pay the difference to Western Alliance or (ii) provide to Western Alliance a lien and security interest in additional collateral acceptable to Western Alliance in its sole and absolute discretion.\nOn March 1, 2021, our SRP was reinstated for our stockholders requesting repurchase of shares as a result of the death or qualified disability of the holder. Permitted repurchase requests must be submitted on or after March 1, 2021. The first settlement of permitted repurchase requests will be on March 31, 2021, the last business day of the month.\n \u2022 Even if our stockholders are able to sell their shares pursuant to our SRP, or otherwise, they may not be able to recover the amount of their investment in our shares; \nOur operating activities generated net cash of $11,998 and $10,078 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. The increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to higher net interest income on our investment portfolio. Our operating activities generated net cash of $10,078 and $3,228 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The increase from cash provided by operating activities was due to the increase in the size of our investment portfolio.\nThe JPM Repo Facility and CF Repo Facility (collectively, the Repo Facilities\u201d) are used to finance eligible loans and act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets.\nLoans are generally placed on non-accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due 90 days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected in full. Accrued and unpaid interest is generally reversed against interest income in the period the loan is placed on non-accrual status. Interest payments received on non-accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management's judgment regarding the borrower's ability to make pending principal and interest payments. Non-accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and, in management's judgment, are likely to remain current. We may make exceptions to placing a loan on non-accrual status if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection.\n\nCash Flow Analysis\nWe held cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $72,107, $37,639 and $28,497 as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash increased due to the net proceeds from the Offerings and the net proceeds from the sale of real estate securities.\n\n (3) Maximum maturity assumes all extension options are exercised by the borrower, however loans may be repaid prior to such date. \n (6) Calculated by taking the sum of (i) the net interest spread multiplied by the average leverage and (ii) the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets. \nThe value of the hotel was appraised by a third-party at $21.6 million as of June 29, 2020, and $14 million as of December 31, 2020. We have estimated a $2.25 million expected loss during 2021 for the Renaissance O'Hare related to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Though vaccinations have begun, there are numerous risks and uncertainties still surrounding the effects of the pandemic, including whether and when a resumption of pre-pandemic levels of travel and in-person meetings and events might happen. Government restrictions on travel and in-person gatherings, reduced demand for these activities from businesses and individuals, and the uncertainties surrounding the duration and effects of the pandemic persist, so we believe it is prudent to have sought the December appraisal and to have reflected in our NAV as of December 31, 2020 our revised valuation of our interest in the hotel and the estimated loss in 2021 from the continued effects of COVID-19.\nThe details of the Repo Facilities as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n (1) For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, none, 38.3% and 49.0% of distributions were paid from the net combined proceeds of our Private Offering and IPO, respectively. \nFunds from Operations and Modified Funds from Operations\nThe IPA defines MFFO as FFO adjusted for acquisition fees and expenses, amounts relating to straight line rents and amortization of premiums on debt investments, non-recurring impairments of real estate-related investments, mark-to-market adjustments included in net income, non-recurring gains or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nThe decrease in the size of our portfolio is primarily due to loans that were paid off or sold during the period. The change in the all-in yield was not significant. The portfolio has not grown during 2020 due to the desire to preserve cash during the early period of the pandemic and the temporary suspension of our IPO.\nPlease refer to Part IV, Item 15, Note 15 - Subsequent Events\u201d and Part I, for additional updates on our business after December 31, 2020.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n (1) First mortgage loans are first position mortgage loans and credit loans are mezzanine and subordinated loans. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we raised combined gross proceeds from the Private Offering and IPO (collectively, the Offerings\u201d), including proceeds from the DRP, of $24,513 and $130,201, respectively. The changes in our portfolio as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 were primarily due to real estate securities sold during the period. Due to the small number of investments in our portfolio, changes in the portfolio composition may be significant. We anticipate that these changes will become less significant as our portfolio increases in size.\nFloating Vs. Fixed Rate Debt Investments:\nOn May 6, 2019, we, through our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into an uncommitted master repurchase agreement (the JPM Repo Facility\u201d) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The JPM Repo Facility provides up to $150,000 in advances that we expect to use to finance the acquisition or origination of eligible loans and participation interests therein. Advances under the JPM Repo Facility accrue interest at per annum rates equal to the sum of (i) the applicable LIBOR index rate plus (ii) a margin of between 1.75% to 2.50%, depending on the attributes of the purchased assets. The initial maturity date of the JPM Repo Facility is May 6, 2021, with two successive one-year extensions at our option, which may be exercised upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. The JPM Repo Facility is subject to certain financial covenants. We were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements as of December 31, 2020.\n (2) Includes the effect of amortization of premium or accretion of discount. \nNet Interest Income\nThe Renaissance O'Hare is a full-service, 16-story hotel consisting of the hotel building and access to an adjoining five-story parking garage shared with an adjacent office building we do not own. The hotel features a business center, fitness center, indoor swimming pool and whirlpool, gift shop, restaurant, Starbucks and 170 available parking spaces. The hotel has 16 meeting and banquet rooms containing a total of 15,754 square feet, the largest of which is 5,000 square feet and seats 600.\n (7) Cash coupon increased to L+5.30% on the payment date in January 2020. \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nWe began operations in October 2016, and our objective is to originate, acquire and manage an investment portfolio mainly of CRE debt that is primarily floating rate and diversified based on the type and location of collateral securing the underlying CRE debt. We anticipate our investment portfolio will be less diversified and have higher concentrations in asset class, collateral type and geographic location until our capital raise reaches levels that will allow for greater diversification.\n (6) Loan has been modified to capitalize a portion of its interest payment for a temporary period of time. The all-in yield assumes the timely payment of interest and principal through maturity. \nAlong with the hospitality sector as a whole, the Renaissance O'Hare was negatively impacted in 2020 by the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to be negatively impacted. The table below includes certain historical information with respect to the average occupancy, the average daily rate and the revenue per available room of the Renaissance O'Hare.\n \u2022 None of our agreements with our Advisor, our Sub-Advisor or any affiliates of our Advisor or Sub-Advisor were negotiated at arm's-length; \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had entered into two master repurchase agreements for real estate securities with separate counterparties and had the following balances outstanding as described in the table below. As of December 31, 2020, we repaid all borrowings under the master repurchase agreements and had no balances outstanding.\n\nOur financing activities (used) provided net cash of $(141,461) and $316,644 for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the repayment of repurchase agreements related to real estate securities that were sold during 2020 and less proceeds from the issuance of common stock. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 due to $12,315 greater net proceeds from issuance of our common stock, including redemptions, and $7,383 greater net proceeds from our repurchase agreement financing, partially offset by $10,007 greater distributions paid.\nWe define MFFO in accordance with the concepts established by the IPA and adjust FFO for certain items, such as amortization of premium and discounts on real estate securities. We purchase real estate securities at a premium or discount to par value, and in accordance with GAAP, record the amortization of premium/accretion of the discount to interest income. We believe that excluding the amortization of premiums and discounts provides better insight to the expected contractual cash flows. In addition, we adjust FFO for unrealized gains or losses on real estate securities. Any mark-to-market or fair value adjustments are based on general market or overall industry conditions and may be temporary in nature.\nFor collateral dependent impaired loans, impairment is measured using the estimated fair value of collateral less the estimated cost to sell. Valuations are performed or obtained at the time a loan is determined to be impaired and designated non-performing, and they are updated if circumstances indicate that a significant change in value has occurred. The Advisor generally will use the income approach through internally developed valuation models to estimate the fair value of the collateral for such loans. In more limited cases, the Advisor will obtain external as is\u201d appraisals for loan collateral, generally when third party participations exist.\nNet interest income is generated on our interest-earning assets less related interest-bearing liabilities. The following table presents the average balance of interest-earning assets less related interest-bearing liabilities, associated interest income and expense and corresponding yield earned and incurred for the periods indicated.\nLoans by Property Type:\n\n (1) All-in yield is the present value of all future principal and interest payments on the loan and does not include any origination fees or deferred commitment fees. \nOperating Expenses\n (4) Calculated as interest income or expense divided by average carrying value. \nWe expect to use advances under the Western Alliance Facility primarily to finance the acquisition or origination of commercial mortgage loans. The Western Alliance Facility is expected to act in the manner of a revolving credit facility that can be repaid as our mortgage loan assets are paid off and re-drawn as advances against new assets. Advances under the Western Alliance Facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus 3.25% with a floor of 4.0%. The initial maturity date of the Western Alliance Facility is March 10, 2023. We have an option to convert the loan made pursuant to the Western Alliance Facility upon its initial maturity to a term loan with the same interest rate and floor and a maturity of two years in exchange for, among other things, a conversion fee of 0.25% of the outstanding amount at the time of conversion.\n (5) Risk rating is the internal risk rating assigned by the Sub-Advisor. The total is the average rating for the portfolio. See Note 3 - Commercial Mortgage Loans Held for Investment,\" which is included in our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \n (1) The weighted average interest rate is based off the balance of the bonds outstanding and the applicable rates. \nWe believe the CRE debt sector continues to represent a large market opportunity. According to Trepp - Federal Reserve Flow of Funds Data, there are approximately $2.1 trillion in U.S. CRE mortgage loans that are expected to mature during the period 2021 through 2025. We believe the large volume of maturing CRE loans over the next five years and the resulting need for borrowers to refinance assets will provide a significant opportunity to originate CRE debt. In addition, this volume of refinancings does not include the need to finance the purchases of CRE properties, which will provide additional finance opportunities.\nRepurchase Agreements\nPortfolio\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. All dollar amounts are stated in thousands, except share data.\nWe use Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), a widely accepted metric, to evaluate our performance. FFO provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other REITs. Due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies, The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) has promulgated a standard known as FFO, which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a REIT. As defined by NAREIT, FFO means net income computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of operating property, plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities. In addition, NAREIT has further clarified the FFO definition to add-back impairment write-downs of depreciable real estate or of investments in unconsolidated entities that are driven by measurable decreases in the fair value of depreciable real estate and to exclude the earnings impacts of cumulative effects of accounting changes. We have adopted the NAREIT definition for computing FFO.\nAlthough occupancy and the hotel's performance has recently trended positively, balancing the potential increase in the price of a future sale against the potential for continued operating losses in the face of the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic is very difficult. Whether we achieve a sale price that is worth waiting for will likely depend in large part on how the aforementioned uncertainties surrounding the pandemic and the return of business travel and in-person large group events unfolds, which could result in a favorable sale price or future operating losses even beyond what we are expecting or a loss on sale, any of which could be material to our future results of operations. We will monitor the market for hotel sales while considering, among other things, the performance of the hotel, relevant market factors and our expected total return weighing current potential disposition prices and redeployment of the sales proceeds into our core investment strategy against the potential disposition prices expected later upon the stabilization of the performance of the hotel.\nRevenue from Real Estate Owned\nFor a discussion of the history of the Company and its Private Offering and IPO, please see Part IV, Item 15, Note 1 - Organization and Business Operations\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements below.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n (5) Calculated by dividing total average interest-bearing liabilities by total average equity (total average interest-earning assets less total average liabilities). \nOur CRE loan portfolio strategy has been to focus on smaller markets and properties owned by experienced and well-capitalized sponsors. Even during the severe market disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our strategy as to CRE loans has proven to be effective. We believe the current market conditions create a favorable investment environment for CRE loans and will improve further as the economy recovers from the pandemic. Our target investments provide the opportunity to participate in a CRE market where values have shown positive trends and we believe income growth is expected to continue.\nOur investing activities provided (used) net cash of $163,931 and ($317,580) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the sale of real estate securities during 2020. Our investing activities used $317,580 and $283,090 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, respectively. The primary driver of the change was due to the origination of mortgage loans and purchase of real estate securities as we invested the proceeds of the Offerings on a levered basis.\nThe following table reconciles stockholders' equity per our consolidated balance sheet to our NAV:\n (2) Stockholder servicing fees only apply to Class T, Class S, and Class D shares. For purposes of NAV, we recognize the stockholder servicing fee as a reduction of NAV on a monthly basis as such fee is paid. Under GAAP, we accrue the full cost of the stockholder servicing fee as an offering cost at the time we sell Class T, Class S and Class D shares. As of December 31, 2020, we have accrued under GAAP $723 of stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to the Class T and Class D shares sold. As of December 31, 2020, we have not sold any Class S shares and, therefore, we have not accrued any stockholder servicing fees payable to the Dealer Manager related to Class S shares. The Dealer Manager does not retain any of these fees, all of which are retained by, or reallowed (paid) to, participating dealers and servicing broker-dealers for ongoing stockholder services performed by such broker-dealers. \nOur FFO and MFFO are calculated as follows:\nWe entered into master repurchase agreements to fund our investment portfolio. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had total borrowings of $290,699 (which is net of $27 of unamortized debt issuance costs) and $443,294 (which is net of $80 of unamortized debt issuance costs), respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had weighted average borrowings of $378,136 and $329,037 and weighted average borrowing costs of 2.7% and 4.2%, respectively. The decrease in borrowings was primarily due to the sale of CMBS that were financed under the master repurchase agreements. The value of the CMBS we held was impacted by the overall market decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, with those securities representing interests in hospitality property loans being severely impacted. As part of our financing relationships, we were required to meet certain financial covenants and, at times, were required to post additional cash or securities as margin to secure our borrowing positions, and in April 2020, we sold six CMBS positions with values negatively impacted in the wake of the pandemic with a total par value of $63.3 million at a realized loss of $19.3 million. With the continued negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we chose to further reduce exposure to CMBS on a levered basis and sold all of our CMBS securities retaining the cash generated to invest in new loan originations. The decrease in the weighted average borrowing costs was primarily due to the change in LIBOR during the period.\nOur presentation of FFO and MFFO may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other REITs. We believe that the use of FFO and MFFO provides a more complete understanding of our operating performance to stockholders and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs. Neither FFO nor MFFO is intended to be an alternative to net income\u201d or to cash flows from operating activities\u201d as determined by GAAP as a measure of our capacity to pay distributions. Management uses FFO and MFFO to compare our operating performance to that of other REITs and to assess our operating performance.\n\n\nPrior to the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price for each class of our common stock in our IPO was $25.00 per share, plus applicable upfront selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Following the NAV Pricing Date, the purchase price per share for each class of our common stock in our IPO generally equals our prior month's NAV per share, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees. Our NAV for each class of shares is based on the net asset values of our investments, the addition of any other assets (such as cash on hand) and the deduction of any liabilities, including the allocation/accrual of any performance participation and any stockholder servicing fees applicable to such class of shares.\nFactors Impacting Our Operating Results", "item_7_tables": "Table 189:

The company is a Maryland REIT focused on originating, acquiring and managing commercial real estate (CRE) debt investments. It is externally managed.\n\nMarket Conditions\n- There continues to be strong competition for CRE lending. The company believes its Sub-advisor's experience will provide access to attractive opportunities.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant adverse impact on the economy and the company's investments, especially a hotel property acquired through foreclosure. The future impacts remain uncertain.\n\nResults of Operations\n- Net loss for 2020 was $28.8 million compared to net income of $13.7 million in 2019, primarily due to realized losses on sale of securities and provision for loan losses related to the foreclosed hotel property.\n\nPortfolio\n- The CRE loan portfolio has performed well through the pandemic. The hospitality loan secured by the foreclosed Renaissance O'Hare hotel has struggled with low occupancy.  \n- The company sold all of its CMBS investments in 2020 following pandemic-related declines.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- The company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity for anticipated uses. Cash sources include offerings proceeds, operating cash flow, repo agreement proceeds and potential future security issuances.\n\nCritical Accounting Policies\n- Key judgments made by management relate to allowance for loan losses, impairment of loans, and fair value measurements.\n\nThe report discusses the impacts of COVID-19, competition, offerings proceeds, and more on financial results, lending portfolio, liquidity, and business operations. A hotel property acquired through foreclosure has posed particular challenges."}
