Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nYou should understand that, under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to statements made in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of Code and intend to qualify annually for such treatment. Our shares are currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol GARS\u201d.\nTable 251: <table><tr><td>61 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by making investments generally in the range of $5.0 million to $25.0 million primarily in debt securities and loans of U.S. based middle-market companies, which we define as those having EBITDA of between $5.0 million and $50.0 million. Our goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by assembling a broad portfolio of investments.\nWe invest primarily in (1) first lien senior secured loans, (2) second lien senior secured loans, (3) one-stop\u201d senior secured or unitranche\u201d loans, (4) subordinated or mezzanine loans, (5) unsecured consumer loans and (6) to a lesser extent, selected equity co-investments in middle-market companies. We use the term one-stop\u201d or unitranche\u201d to refer to a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans. We use the term mezzanine\u201d to refer to a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower's other indebtedness.\nWe believe that the middle market offers attractive risk-adjusted returns for debt investors. Historically, we believe there has been a persistent scarcity of available capital relative to demand, which, from a lender's perspective, has generally resulted in more favorable transaction structures, including enhanced covenant protection and increased pricing relative to larger companies. In addition, we believe that middle-market companies traditionally have exhibited lower default rates and improved recoveries compared to larger borrowers and typically offer greater access to key senior managers, which we believe further enhances the attractiveness of lending to this market segment and facilitates due diligence investigations and regular monitoring.\nOur investment activities are managed by Garrison Capital Advisers LLC, our Investment Adviser. The six member investment committee of our Investment Adviser is comprised of Joseph Tansey, Brian Chase, Mitch Drucker, Susan George, Robert Chimenti and Joshua Brandt. Our Investment Adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on prospective investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay a base management fee and an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser for its services. The Administrator provides certain administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate, including office facilities and equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services, pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator oversees our financial reporting and prepares our reports to stockholders and reports required to be filed with the SEC.\nThe Administrator also manages the determination and publication of our net asset value, the preparation and filing of our tax returns and generally monitors the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. The Administrator may retain third parties to assist in providing administrative services to us. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any profit to the Administrator.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held investments in 58 portfolio companies with a fair value of $376.7 million, including investments in 41 portfolio companies held through the 2016-2 CLO. The investments held by the 2016-2 CLO as of December 31, 2016 consisted of senior secured loans fair valued at $260.2 million and related indebtedness of $164.3 million. As of that date, the loans held by the 2016-2 CLO (held at fair value), together with cash and other assets held by the 2016-2 CLO, equaled approximately $275.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.9% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 37 months.\nTable 252: <table><tr><td>62 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held investments in 67 portfolio companies with a fair value of $415.0 million, including investments in 50 portfolio companies held through the 2013-2 CLO. The investments held by the 2013-2 CLO as of December 31, 2015 consisted of senior secured loans fair valued at $306.6 million and related indebtedness of $194.8 million. As of that date, the loans held by the 2013-2 CLO (held at fair value), together with cash and other assets held by the 2013-2 CLO, equaled approximately $323.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.8% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 44 months.\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest earned on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains and distributions, if any, on the equity interests or warrants that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche or mezzanine loans, typically have a term of one to six years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest is generally payable quarterly or semiannually, and in some cases, loans may have a PIK feature. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of loan origination, prepayment, facility, commitment, forbearance and amendment fees. We also may receive structuring or diligence fees, consulting fees and possibly fees for providing managerial assistance. Origination fees received by us are initially deferred and reduced from the cost basis of the investment and subsequently accreted into interest income over the remaining stated term of the loan.\nUpon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Facility fees, sometimes referred to as asset management fees, are accrued as a percentage periodic fee on the base amount (either the funded facility amount or the committed principal amount). Commitment fees are based upon the undrawn portion committed by us and are accrued over the life of the loan.\nAmendment and forbearance fees are paid in connection with loan amendments and waivers and are recognized upon completion of the amendments or waivers, generally when such fees are receivable. Any such fees are recorded and classified as other income and included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. As these fees are paid and recognized in connection with specific loan amendments or forbearance, they are typically non-recurring in nature.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of (1) the base management fee and incentive fee to the Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement; (2) the allocable portion of overhead to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement; (3) the interest expense on our outstanding debt, if any; and (4) our other operating costs, as detailed below. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>our organization; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>calculating our net asset value and net asset value per share (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Investment Adviser or payable to third parties in performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>offerings of our common stock and other securities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>distributions on our shares; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 259: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, evaluating, making and disposing of investments; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 260: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>brokerage fees and commissions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>registration fees; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>listing fees; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>taxes; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>independent director fees and expenses; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>costs of holding stockholder meetings; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>our fidelity bond; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and any other insurance premiums; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 270: <table><tr><td>63 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 271: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>litigation, indemnification and other non-recurring or extraordinary expenses; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 272: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, including audit and legal costs; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>dues, fees and charges of any trade association of which we are a member; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs and expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines.\nRecent Developments\nOn February 28, 2017 the Board approved a distribution in the amount of $4.5 million, or $0.28 a share, which will be paid on March 30, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March 23, 2017.\nPortfolio Activity\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we made investments of $101.3 million to 12 new portfolio companies and $14.0 million of add-on investments to existing portfolio companies resulting in aggregate $115.3 million of portfolio additions at a weighted average yield of 10.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, repayments in our portfolio consisted of 17 early full repayments and partial repayments and sales totaling an aggregate par of $139.1 million with a weighted average yield of 10.2%.\nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016, we made investments of $15.7 million to two new portfolio companies and $2.9 million of add-on investments to existing portfolio companies resulting in aggregate $18.6 million of portfolio additions at a weighted average yield of 8.0%. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, repayments in our portfolio consisted of seven early full repayments and partial repayments and sales totaling an aggregate par of $42.8 million with a weighted average yield of 11.5%.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAs a business development company and a RIC, we are subject to certain constraints on our operations, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code.\nTable 276: <table><tr><td>64 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nConsolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are as follows:\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 vs. 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands, except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net investment income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,944 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,859 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,935 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total investment income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,317 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,366 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,077 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net realized (loss)/gain on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30,591 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,685 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,702 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,906 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,387 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net change in unrealized gain/(loss) on investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,919 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,227 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,692 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease)/increase in net assets resulting from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,810 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,660 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,150 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34,144 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net investment income per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.79 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.61 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.48 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net realized/unrealized (loss)/gain from investments per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.48 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.01 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.52 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (loss)/earnings per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.30 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.22 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.08 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.04 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net asset value per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.56 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.60 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $19.1 million, $29.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. Net investment income decreased by $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, as described below under Total Investment Income\u201d and Expenses.\u201d\nTotal Investment Income\nTotal investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $43.0 million, $51.3 million and $50.5 million, respectively.\nTotal investment income decreased by $(8.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a decrease in interest income in the amount of $(6.9) million and a decrease in other income of $(1.5) million.\nThe decrease in interest income was largely driven by our non-performing assets and lower investment balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was primarily driven by lower prepayment and amendment fees recognized during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nTotal investment income increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an increase in interest income in the amount of $1.5 million, offset by a decrease in dividend income in the amount of $(0.4) million and a decrease in net accretion from the amortization of discounts in the amount of $(0.2) million.\nThe increase in interest income was largely driven by an increase in the weighted average yield of our debt investments to 10.8% in 2015 from 10.5% in 2014. The decrease in dividend income was primarily driven by decrease in dividend income from one portfolio investment that was sold in 2014.\nExpenses\nTotal expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $23.9 million, $21.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the increase in total expenses of $2.5 million was driven primarily by (i) non-recurring expenses in the amount of $3.4 million related to the refinancing of the 2013-2 CLO and (ii) higher interest expense on our debt outstanding offset by lower management and incentive fees recorded.\nThe $3.4 million of non-recurring expenses related to the refinancing of the 2013-2 CLO was comprised of (i) a $1.8 million write-off of third party expenses associated with our 2013-2 CLO which had been previously deferred and were being amortized over the stated life of the 2013-2 CLO and (ii) the acceleration of $1.6 million of third party expenses associated with the execution of the 2016-2 CLO.\nTable 278: <table><tr><td>65 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table summarizes our expenses, net of fee waivers and excluding the losses on the refinancing of the secured notes offered in the 2013-2 CLO and the $10.0 million revolving facility of GLC Trust 2013-2, or the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and the acceleration of deferred financing costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 vs. 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 vs. 2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> <td> </td> <td>Variance </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,313 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>271 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Management fees (net of waivers) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,972 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,755 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(783 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(310 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Incentive fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,135 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,274 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Directors fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>405 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Administrator expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,052 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>340 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,492 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,373 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(881 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,833 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense increased $0.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase in the average effective interest rate on debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average effective interest rate for total outstanding debt was 3.88% and 3.20%, respectively.\nInterest expense increased $0.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in the average effective interest rate on debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the weighted average effective interest rate for total outstanding debt was 3.20% and 3.04%, respectively.\nManagement fees decreased $(0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was driven by a reduction in total assets and the irrevocable waiver of certain fees during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures around these fee waivers.\nTable 280: <table><tr><td>66 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement fees decreased $(0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the decrease in total assets.\nIncentive fees decreased $(1.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. Incentive fees decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the reversal of Income-based incentive fees that were subject to the Incentive Fee Cap & Deferral Mechanism, as a result of realized and unrealized losses on investments. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our incentive fee.\nIncentive fees decreased $(7.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. Incentive fees decreased in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the reversal of Capital Gains based incentive fees that were previously accrued under U.S. GAAP and the reversal of Income-based incentive fees that were subject to the Incentive Fee Cap & Deferral Mechanism. These reversals were driven by realized and unrealized losses on investments.\nAdministrator expenses increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to higher overhead staffing costs. Administrator expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher allocation of overhead costs due to the hiring of additional personnel.\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized a net loss on investments of $(30.6) million. Net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily driven by a $(12.7) million loss in connection with the restructuring of our investment in Speed Commerce Inc., a $(11.1) million loss on BFN Operations LLC, a $(5.8) million loss on Forest Park Medical Center at Fort Worth, a $(1.3) million loss on SC Academy Holdings, Inc. and $(1.3) million of realized losses in the GLC Trust 2013-2's consumer loan portfolio. This was partially offset by a $0.3 million realized gain on Ellman International, Inc., a $0.3 million realized gain on Provo Craft Holdings, LLC and $1.0 million of gains from the partial and full repayments and sales of other portfolio investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized a net loss on investments of $(11.7) million. Net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily driven by $(8.5) million of realized losses incurred from the significant restructurings of two portfolio investments, a realized loss of $(4.4) million from the early full repayment of one portfolio investment, and $(2.8) million of realized losses in GLC Trust 2013-2's consumer loan portfolio. This was offset by a $2.5 million realized gain incurred from the partial sale of one portfolio investment and net realized gains of $1.5 million incurred from the early full repayment of 17 portfolio investments, the sale of one portfolio investment and other partial repayments.\nTable 281: <table><tr><td>67 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized net gains on investments of $10.7 million. Net realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven primarily by $8.4 million of realized gains incurred from the sale of the parent company of one portfolio company, Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, Inc., resulting in the early full repayment of the debt and sale of the equity, with the remaining net realized gain of $2.3 million resulting from the sale of 15 portfolio investments, early full repayment of 33 portfolio investments and other partial repayments.\nThe net change in unrealized gain on investments of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by $16.9 million from the reversal of prior period net unrealized losses across 16 investments and positive fair value adjustments of $3.6 million, partially offset by $(10.2) million of negative credit-related adjustments across 6 portfolio investments and $(3.6) million of negative market-related adjustments across 4 portfolio investments. The $16.9 million of reversals of prior period net unrealized losses included $9.8 million from Speed Commerce, Inc., $5.3 million from BFN Operations LLC and $1.8 million from Forest Park Medical Center at Fort Worth. The $2.8 million of positive fair value adjustments were primarily driven by yield adjustments due to tightening credit spreads and higher bid quotations on our syndicated credits. The $(10.2) million of negative credit-related adjustments included unrealized losses from the Forest Park Medical Center at San Antonio, Badlands Production Company and Speed Commerce Investment Partners investments in the amounts of $(3.9) million, $(3.8) million and $(1.7) million, respectively. The $(3.6) million of market-related adjustments was comprised of $(2.2) million from our equity investment in Prosper Marketplace, $(0.8) million from Rooster Energy Inc., $(0.3) million from Confluence Outdoors, LLC and $(0.3) million from Profusion Industries, LLC.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the net change in unrealized loss on investments was $(21.9) million. The net change in unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by $(20.8) million of negative credit related adjustment of four portfolio investments, $(4.0) million of negative market-related adjustment on 20 portfolio investments, a net $(1.3) million reversal of prior period unrealized gains resulting from the full repayment of five portfolio investments and the partial sale of one portfolio investment and $(0.4) million negative adjustment related to the GLC Trust consumer loan portfolio. This was offset by $4.3 million from the reversal of prior period unrealized losses resulting from the significant restructuring of two portfolio investments, and an increase of $0.4 million in the value of two portfolio investment. The remaining net change in unrealized loss on investments was due to the decrease in the market value of the remaining portfolio in the amount of $(0.1) million.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the net change in unrealized loss on investments was $(2.2) million. The net change in unrealized loss for year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the reversal of prior period unrealized gain in the amount of $(1.8) million as a result of the sale of the parent company of Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, Inc. and the negative credit related adjustment of three portfolio investments in the amount of $(5.3) million, offset by the increase in value of two portfolio investments in the amount of $6.1 million. The remaining net change in unrealized loss on investments was due to the reversal of prior period unrealized loss of $0.3 million and the decrease in the market value of the remaining portfolio in the amount of $(1.5) million.\nNet (Decrease) / Increase in Net Assets from Operations\nWe had a net asset value per common share outstanding on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 of $12.42, $13.98 and $15.58, respectively.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,149,866, the net decrease in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $(0.31). This decrease was primarily driven by net realized losses from investments incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,742,531, the net decrease in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $(0.22).\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,758,779, the net increase in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.82.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs a business development company, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and will have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We generate cash primarily from offerings of our equity securities and the issuance of debt securities including the 2016-2 Notes, as described below, Garrison SBIC Debentures and any repayments of portfolio investments. In addition, our cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less also provide liquidity.\nTable 282: <table><tr><td>68 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had cash of $10.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively. Also, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had restricted cash of $12.6 million and $11.8 million, respectively.\nIn addition to proceeds from public and private offerings of our debt and equity securities, we have identified three portfolio companies with a total par value of $10.0 million and a fair value of $9.9 million which we view as transitory investments. Transitory investments are generally those investments that we view as an additional source of liquidity that we are able to sell in order to fund investments that fit our core investment strategy. These transitory investments are generally at the lower end of our target portfolio yield range.\nOur primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of our common stock, payments of interest on our debt, and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings and our transitory portfolio as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to fund our anticipated funding requirements through at least December 31, 2017.\nTable 283: <table><tr><td>69 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables reflect the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common stock for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nTable 284: <table> <tr> <td>Record Dates ($ in thousands except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td>Board Approval Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution Declared </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution Declared per Share </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year Ended December 31, 2016 (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 9, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 1, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 23, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 9, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>August 2, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 23, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>June 10, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>May 2, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 24, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 8, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>February 24, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 28, 2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 285: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Does not include any return of capital for tax purposes. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table> <tr> <td>Record Dates ($ in thousands except per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td>Board Approval Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Payment Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution Declared </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution Declared per Share </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Year ended December 31, 2015 (1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 11, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>November 2, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 28, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>September 10, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>July 30, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 25, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>June 12, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>April 30, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 26, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>March 20, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 3, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 27, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Does not include any return of capital for tax purposes. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash decreased by $(14.6) million as a result of net cash provided by operating activities of $37.0 million offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $(51.6) million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities resulted mainly from net investment income in the amount of $19.1 million, repayments and sales of investments in the amount of $107.2 million and $34.1 million, respectively, offset by purchases of investments in the amount of $123.9 million, and net realized loss from investments in the amount of $30.6 million.

Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the DGCL.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. We have identified the following as critical accounting policies.\nBasis for Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Garrison Capital Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as us using consistent accounting policies. Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies, codified in ASC Topic 946, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company.\nWe generally consolidate any investment company when we own 100% of its partners' or members' capital or equity units or 100% of the economic equity interest. ASC Topic 946 provides for the consolidation of a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to the investment company or its consolidated subsidiaries.\nGarrison Funding 2013-2 Manager LLC owns a 100% economic interest in Garrison Funding 2013-2 Ltd., which was an investment company for accounting purposes, and also provided collateral management services solely to Garrison Funding 2013-2 Ltd.. As such, we consolidated the accounts of these entities into these consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, the amounts outstanding under the 2013-2 CLO are treated as our indebtedness.\nGarrison Capital Inc. owns a 100% economic interest in GF 2016-2, which was an investment company for accounting purposes, and also provides collateral management services solely to GF 2016-2. As such, hawse have consolidated the accounts of these entities into its consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, the amounts outstanding under the 2016-2 CLO are treated as our indebtedness.\nThe GARS Equity Holdings Entities, Walnut Hill II LLC, Forest Park II LLC, Garrison SBIC and GLC Trust 2013-2 are 100% owned investment companies for accounting purposes. As such, we have consolidated the accounts of these entities into these consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, indebtedness of Garrison SBIC and the amounts outstanding under the GLC Trust 2013-2 Notes are treated as our indebtedness.\nValuation of Portfolio Investments\nWe value our investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820's definition of fair value focuses on exit price in the principal, or most advantageous, market and prioritizes the use of market-based inputs over entity-specific inputs within a measurement of fair value. ASC Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\nTable 301: <table><tr><td>74 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 302: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 1 - </td> <td>quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 303: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 - </td> <td>other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayments, credit risk, etc.) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 - </td> <td>significant unobservable inputs (including the Investment Adviser's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair values of investments) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by the independent valuation firms each quarter.\nOur portfolio consists of primarily debt investments and unsecured consumer loans. The fair value of our investments is initially determined by investment professionals of our Investment Adviser and ultimately determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis.\nIn valuing our debt investments, the Investment Adviser generally uses various approaches, including proprietary models that consider the analyses of independent valuation agents as well as credit risk, liquidity, market credit spreads, other applicable factors for similar transactions and bid quotations obtained from other financial institutions that trade in similar investments or based on bid prices provided by independent third party pricing services.\nThe types of factors that the board of directors may take into account when reviewing the fair value initially derived by the Investment Adviser and determining the fair value of the our debt investments generally include, as appropriate, comparison to publicly traded securities, including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors.\nIn valuing our unsecured consumer loans, the Investment Adviser generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology based upon a set of assumptions. The primary assumptions used to value the unsecured consumer loans include prepayment and default rates derived from historical performance, actual performance as compared to historical projections and discount rates.\nThe types of factors that the board of directors may take into account when reviewing the fair value initially derived by the Investment Adviser and determining the fair value of our consumer loan investments generally include, as appropriate, prepayment and default rates derived from historical performance, actual performance as compared to historical projections and discount rates.\nOur board of directors has retained several independent valuation firms to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation at least once during each 12-month period. To the extent a security is reviewed in a particular quarter, it is reviewed and valued by only one service provider. However, our board of directors does not intend to have de minimis investments of less than 0.5% of our total assets (up to an aggregate of 10% of our total assets) independently reviewed. Our board of directors is responsible for determining the fair value of our assets in good faith using a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process.\nDue to the nature of our strategy, our portfolio includes relatively illiquid investments that are privately held. Inputs into the determination of fair value of our portfolio investments require significant management judgment or estimation. This means that our portfolio valuations are based on unobservable inputs and our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. Valuations of privately held investments are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates. The determination of fair value by our board of directors may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed. Our net asset value could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher or lower than the values that we ultimately realized upon the disposal of such investments.\nThe valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by the independent valuation firms each quarter. When an external event with respect to one of our portfolio companies, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we expect to use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation .\nTable 305: <table><tr><td>75 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors will undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nTable 306: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for credit monitoring. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and our Investment Adviser. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The valuation committee of the board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available quotation is reviewed by an independent valuation firm, subject to the de minimis exception above. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet assets could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of the investments were materially higher or lower than the values that are ultimately realized upon the disposal of such investments.\nInvestment Transactions and Related Investment Income and Expense\nWe record our investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when we have determined that all material terms have been defined for the transactions. These transactions could possibly settle on a subsequent date depending on the transaction type. All related revenue and expenses attributable to these transactions are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations commencing on the trade date unless otherwise specified by the transaction documents. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are recorded on the specific identification method.\nWe accrue interest income if we expect that ultimately we will be able to collect it. Generally, when an interest default occurs on a loan in our portfolio, or if our management otherwise believes that the issuer of the loan will not be able to service the loan and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, we remain contractually entitled to this interest. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. For consumer loans, any loan which is 120 days past due is considered defaulted and 100% of the principal is charged off with no expected recovery or sale of defaulted receivables. We had two investments placed on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2016 and four investments placed on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2015.\nAny original issue discounts, as well as any other purchase discounts or premiums on debt investments, are accreted or amortized and included in interest income over the maturity periods of the investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense is recorded on an accrual basis and is adjusted for amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.\nOther Expenses\nExpenses related to, but not limited to, ratings expenses, due diligence, valuation expenses and independent collateral appraisals may arise when we make certain investments. These expenses, as well as insurance expenses and trustee expenses are recognized as incurred in the consolidated statements of operations within other expenses.\nTable 311: <table><tr><td>76 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoan Origination, Facility, Commitment and Amendment Fees\nWe may receive loan origination fees when making a new investment, as well as prepayment, facility, commitment, forbearance, and amendment fees during the life of the investment.\nOrigination fees received by us are initially deferred and reduced from the cost basis of the investment and subsequently accreted into interest income over the remaining stated term of the loan.\nUpon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Facility fees, sometimes referred to as asset management fees, are accrued as a percentage periodic fee on the base amount (either the funded facility amount or the committed principal amount). Commitment fees are based upon the undrawn portion committed by us and are accrued over the life of the loan.\nAmendment and forbearance fees are paid in connection with loan amendments and waivers and are recognized upon completion of the amendments or waivers, generally when such fees are receivable. Any such fees are recorded and classified as other income and included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. As these fees are paid and recognized in connection with specific loan amendments or forbearance, they are typically non-recurring in nature.\nShare Repurchase\nShare repurchase transactions are recorded on a trade date basis, which is the date when management has determined that all material legal terms have been contractually defined for the transactions. The aggregate cost of common stock repurchased, including any direct transaction costs, will be recorded as a reduction of the par and paid-in-capital in excess of par value accounts, respectively.\nDistributions\nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.\nWe have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our board of directors declares a cash dividend or other distribution, then our stockholders who have not \u2018opted out' of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution.\nNo action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have their cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for distributions to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends or other distributions in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than 10 days prior to the record date, the plan administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant's account, issue a certificate registered in the participant's name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share. The plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission from the proceeds of the sale of any fractional share of common stock.\nThose stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends and other distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.\nIncome Tax\nAs a business development company, we elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and intend to qualify annually for such treatment.\nWe intend to comply with all RIC qualification provisions contained in the Code including certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements as well as the Annual Distribution Requirements. As a RIC, we do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders in a timely manner. However, we are subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate tax rates on any net ordinary income or net capital gain not distributed to our stockholders assuming we meet the Annual Distribution Requirement.\nTable 312: <table><tr><td>77 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We would then pay a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, was recorded for U.S. federal excise tax, respectively.", "item_7_truncated": "With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors will undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held investments in 58 portfolio companies with a fair value of $376.7 million.

Generally, when an interest default occurs on a loan in our portfolio, or if our management otherwise believes that the issuer of the loan will not be able to service the loan and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, we remain contractually entitled to this interest. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. For consumer loans, any loan which is 120 days past due is considered defaulted and 100% of the principal is charged off with no expected recovery or sale of defaulted receivables. We had two investments placed on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2016 and four investments placed on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td>

Net cash used in financing activities resulted from cash distributions in the amount of $21.5 million, repayment of the senior secured revolving notes of the CLOs in the amount of $35.0 million, repayment of the GLC Trust 2013-2 Class A notes in the amount of $10.9 million, repurchases of common stock in the amount of $5.0 million and debt issuance costs of $2.8 million, offset by proceeds from the Garrison SBIC borrowings in the amount of $17.7 million and net proceeds from the borrowing on senior secured term notes of the CLOs in the amount of $6.0 million.\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nThe valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by the independent valuation firms each quarter.\nInvestment Transactions and Related Investment Income and Expense\nNo action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have their cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for distributions to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends or other distributions in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than 10 days prior to the record date, the plan administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant's account, issue a certificate registered in the participant's name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share. The plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission from the proceeds of the sale of any fractional share of common stock.\nYou should understand that, under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to statements made in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\nExpenses\nDue to the nature of our strategy, our portfolio includes relatively illiquid investments that are privately held. Inputs into the determination of fair value of our portfolio investments require significant management judgment or estimation. This means that our portfolio valuations are based on unobservable inputs and our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. Valuations of privately held investments are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates. The determination of fair value by our board of directors may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed. Our net asset value could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher or lower than the values that we ultimately realized upon the disposal of such investments.\nIn valuing our unsecured consumer loans, the Investment Adviser generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology based upon a set of assumptions. The primary assumptions used to value the unsecured consumer loans include prepayment and default rates derived from historical performance, actual performance as compared to historical projections and discount rates.\n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \nThose stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends and other distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.\n \u2022 Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for credit monitoring. \nThe $3.4 million of non-recurring expenses related to the refinancing of the 2013-2 CLO was comprised of (i) a $1.8 million write-off of third party expenses associated with our 2013-2 CLO which had been previously deferred and were being amortized over the stated life of the 2013-2 CLO and (ii) the acceleration of $1.6 million of third party expenses associated with the execution of the 2016-2 CLO.\n \u2022 our organization; \n \u2022 the relative and absolute performance of our Investment Adviser, including in identifying suitable investments for us; \nShare Repurchase\nDistributions\nOur investment activities are managed by Garrison Capital Advisers LLC, our Investment Adviser.

The Administrator provides certain administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate, including office facilities and equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services, pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator oversees our financial reporting and prepares our reports to stockholders and reports required to be filed with the SEC.\n \u2022 fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Investment Adviser or payable to third parties in performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; \n \u2022 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, evaluating, making and disposing of investments; \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $4.8 million and $6.9 million of outstanding commitments to fund such investments, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $22.9 million and $36.8 million of cash and restricted cash, respectively.\n \u2022 our ability to make distributions to our stockholders; \nWe record our investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when we have determined that all material terms have been defined for the transactions. These transactions could possibly settle on a subsequent date depending on the transaction type. All related revenue and expenses attributable to these transactions are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations commencing on the trade date unless otherwise specified by the transaction documents. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are recorded on the specific identification method.\nLoan Origination, Facility, Commitment and Amendment Fees\nExpenses\n\n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, including audit and legal costs; \nAs a business development company, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and will have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We generate cash primarily from offerings of our equity securities and the issuance of debt securities including the 2016-2 Notes, as described below, Garrison SBIC Debentures and any repayments of portfolio investments. In addition, our cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less also provide liquidity.\nGarrison Funding 2013-2 Manager LLC owns a 100% economic interest in Garrison Funding 2013-2 Ltd., which was an investment company for accounting purposes, and also provided collateral management services solely to Garrison Funding 2013-2 Ltd.. As such, we consolidated the accounts of these entities into these consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, the amounts outstanding under the 2013-2 CLO are treated as our indebtedness.\nWe use words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d might,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d can,\u201d would,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d and similar words to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth as Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTotal investment income increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an increase in interest income in the amount of $1.5 million, offset by a decrease in dividend income in the amount of $(0.4) million and a decrease in net accretion from the amortization of discounts in the amount of $(0.2) million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash increased by $11.3 million as a result of net cash provided by operating activities of $49.5 million offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $(38.2) million.\n \u2022 the dependence of our future success on the general economy, including general economic trends, and its impact on the industries in which we invest; \nInflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented in our financial statements. However, from time to time, inflation may impact the operating results of our portfolio companies.\n______________\n \u2022 litigation, indemnification and other non-recurring or extraordinary expenses; \nIncome Tax\nThe following table summarizes our expenses, net of fee waivers and excluding the losses on the refinancing of the secured notes offered in the 2013-2 CLO and the $10.0 million revolving facility of GLC Trust 2013-2, or the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and the acceleration of deferred financing costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n \u2022 distributions on our shares; \nShare repurchase transactions are recorded on a trade date basis, which is the date when management has determined that all material legal terms have been contractually defined for the transactions. The aggregate cost of common stock repurchased, including any direct transaction costs, will be recorded as a reduction of the par and paid-in-capital in excess of par value accounts, respectively.\n \u2022 At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available quotation is reviewed by an independent valuation firm, subject to the de minimis exception above. \n Level 1 - quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we made investments of $101.3 million to 12 new portfolio companies and $14.0 million of add-on investments to existing portfolio companies resulting in aggregate $115.3 million of portfolio additions at a weighted average yield of 10.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, repayments in our portfolio consisted of 17 early full repayments and partial repayments and sales totaling an aggregate par of $139.1 million with a weighted average yield of 10.2%.\nInflation\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the net change in unrealized loss on investments was $(2.2) million. The net change in unrealized loss for year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the reversal of prior period unrealized gain in the amount of $(1.8) million as a result of the sale of the parent company of Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, Inc. and the negative credit related adjustment of three portfolio investments in the amount of $(5.3) million, offset by the increase in value of two portfolio investments in the amount of $6.1 million. The remaining net change in unrealized loss on investments was due to the reversal of prior period unrealized loss of $0.3 million and the decrease in the market value of the remaining portfolio in the amount of $(1.5) million.\n 70 \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities resulted mainly from net investment income in the amount of $29.9 million, repayments and sales of investments in the amount of $198.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, offset by purchases of investments in the amount of $181.0 million, and realized losses in the amount of $11.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities resulted from cash distributions in the amount of $23.4 million, repayment of the senior secured revolving notes in the amount of $15.0 million, repayment of the GLC Trust 2013-2 Class A notes in the amount of $14.9 million, repurchases of common stock in the amount of $3.3 million, and debt issuance costs of $0.8 million, offset by proceeds from the Garrison SBIC borrowings in the amount of $19.3 million.\nTotal investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $43.0 million, $51.3 million and $50.5 million, respectively.\n 75 \nThe GARS Equity Holdings Entities, Walnut Hill II LLC, Forest Park II LLC, Garrison SBIC and GLC Trust 2013-2 are 100% owned investment companies for accounting purposes. As such, we have consolidated the accounts of these entities into these consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, indebtedness of Garrison SBIC and the amounts outstanding under the GLC Trust 2013-2 Notes are treated as our indebtedness.\n\nInterest expense increased $0.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in the average effective interest rate on debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the weighted average effective interest rate for total outstanding debt was 3.20% and 3.04%, respectively.\nThe increase in interest income was largely driven by an increase in the weighted average yield of our debt investments to 10.8% in 2015 from 10.5% in 2014. The decrease in dividend income was primarily driven by decrease in dividend income from one portfolio investment that was sold in 2014.\n \u2022 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies; and \nTotal expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $23.9 million, $21.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively.\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of (1) the base management fee and incentive fee to the Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement; (2) the allocable portion of overhead to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement; (3) the interest expense on our outstanding debt, if any; and (4) our other operating costs, as detailed below. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized a net loss on investments of $(30.6) million. Net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily driven by a $(12.7) million loss in connection with the restructuring of our investment in Speed Commerce Inc., a $(11.1) million loss on BFN Operations LLC, a $(5.8) million loss on Forest Park Medical Center at Fort Worth, a $(1.3) million loss on SC Academy Holdings, Inc. and $(1.3) million of realized losses in the GLC Trust 2013-2's consumer loan portfolio. This was partially offset by a $0.3 million realized gain on Ellman International, Inc., a $0.3 million realized gain on Provo Craft Holdings, LLC and $1.0 million of gains from the partial and full repayments and sales of other portfolio investments.\nThe following tables reflect the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common stock for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nWe entered into the Administration Agreement on October 9, 2012 with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations.\n (1) Includes $7.0 million of interim financings which mature on March 29, 2017, upon which we expect them to be pooled in ten year, SBA-guaranteed debentures. \nNet Investment Income\nGarrison Capital Inc. owns a 100% economic interest in GF 2016-2, which was an investment company for accounting purposes, and also provides collateral management services solely to GF 2016-2. As such, hawse have consolidated the accounts of these entities into its consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, the amounts outstanding under the 2016-2 CLO are treated as our indebtedness.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,149,866, the net decrease in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $(0.31). This decrease was primarily driven by net realized losses from investments incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 our fidelity bond; \nWe invest primarily in (1) first lien senior secured loans, (2) second lien senior secured loans, (3) one-stop\u201d senior secured or unitranche\u201d loans, (4) subordinated or mezzanine loans, (5) unsecured consumer loans and (6) to a lesser extent, selected equity co-investments in middle-market companies. We use the term one-stop\u201d or unitranche\u201d to refer to a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans. We use the term mezzanine\u201d to refer to a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower's other indebtedness.\nManagement fees decreased $(0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the decrease in total assets.\n \u2022 calculating our net asset value and net asset value per share (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); \nValuation of Portfolio Investments\n 64 \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities resulted mainly from net investment income in the amount of $22.0 million, realized gains in the amount of $10.7 million, repayments and sales of investments in the amount of $293.8 million and $105.6 million, respectively, as well as a decrease in due from counterparties in the amount of $5.1 million, offset by purchases of investments in the amount of $427.1 million and a decrease in due to counterparties in the amount of $7.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities resulted from cash distributions in the amount of $23.5 million, repayment of the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver in the amount of $9.7 million and debt issuance costs of $0.5 million, offset by proceeds from the GLC Trust 2013-2 Notes in the amount of $30.4 million.\n \u2022 listing fees; \nWe intend to comply with all RIC qualification provisions contained in the Code including certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements as well as the Annual Distribution Requirements. As a RIC, we do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders in a timely manner. However, we are subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate tax rates on any net ordinary income or net capital gain not distributed to our stockholders assuming we meet the Annual Distribution Requirement.\n 65 \n \u2022 brokerage fees and commissions; \n \u2022 our expected financings and investments; \nAmendment and forbearance fees are paid in connection with loan amendments and waivers and are recognized upon completion of the amendments or waivers, generally when such fees are receivable. Any such fees are recorded and classified as other income and included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. As these fees are paid and recognized in connection with specific loan amendments or forbearance, they are typically non-recurring in nature.\nThe types of factors that the board of directors may take into account when reviewing the fair value initially derived by the Investment Adviser and determining the fair value of the our debt investments generally include, as appropriate, comparison to publicly traded securities, including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors.\nAdministrator expenses increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to higher overhead staffing costs. Administrator expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher allocation of overhead costs due to the hiring of additional personnel.\nWe had a net asset value per common share outstanding on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 of $12.42, $13.98 and $15.58, respectively.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Garrison Capital Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as us using consistent accounting policies. Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies, codified in ASC Topic 946, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company.\nAny original issue discounts, as well as any other purchase discounts or premiums on debt investments, are accreted or amortized and included in interest income over the maturity periods of the investments.\nWe believe that the middle market offers attractive risk-adjusted returns for debt investors. Historically, we believe there has been a persistent scarcity of available capital relative to demand, which, from a lender's perspective, has generally resulted in more favorable transaction structures, including enhanced covenant protection and increased pricing relative to larger companies. In addition, we believe that middle-market companies traditionally have exhibited lower default rates and improved recoveries compared to larger borrowers and typically offer greater access to key senior managers, which we believe further enhances the attractiveness of lending to this market segment and facilitates due diligence investigations and regular monitoring.\n 66 \n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our current and prospective portfolio companies; \nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had $4.8 million and $6.9 million of unfunded commitments, respectively, with a fair value of $(0.1) million and $(0.1) million, respectively. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement.\n \u2022 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; \nConsolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are as follows:\n 72 \nPortfolio Composition and Select Portfolio Information\nWe may receive loan origination fees when making a new investment, as well as prepayment, facility, commitment, forbearance, and amendment fees during the life of the investment.\n (1) Does not include any return of capital for tax purposes. \nAmendment and forbearance fees are paid in connection with loan amendments and waivers and are recognized upon completion of the amendments or waivers, generally when such fees are receivable. Any such fees are recorded and classified as other income and included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. As these fees are paid and recognized in connection with specific loan amendments or forbearance, they are typically non-recurring in nature.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held investments in 67 portfolio companies with a fair value of $415.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.8% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 44 months.\nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on information available to us on the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nTotal investment income decreased by $(8.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a decrease in interest income in the amount of $(6.9) million and a decrease in other income of $(1.5) million.\n \u2022 offerings of our common stock and other securities; \nInterest expense is recorded on an accrual basis and is adjusted for amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.\nSubject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $25.0 million available for additional borrowings under our senior secured revolving notes of the 2016-2 CLO, $33.0 million of available SBIC leverage and no available borrowings under the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $15.0 million available for additional borrowings under our senior secured revolving notes of the 2013-2 CLO, $15.7 million of available SBIC leverage and no available borrowings under the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver.\n \u2022 registration fees; \nWe generally consolidate any investment company when we own 100% of its partners' or members' capital or equity units or 100% of the economic equity interest. ASC Topic 946 provides for the consolidation of a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to the investment company or its consolidated subsidiaries.\n \u2022 The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. \nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We would then pay a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, was recorded for U.S. federal excise tax, respectively.\nThe net change in unrealized gain on investments of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by $16.9 million from the reversal of prior period net unrealized losses across 16 investments and positive fair value adjustments of $3.6 million, partially offset by $(10.2) million of negative credit-related adjustments across 6 portfolio investments and $(3.6) million of negative market-related adjustments across 4 portfolio investments. The $16.9 million of reversals of prior period net unrealized losses included $9.8 million from Speed Commerce, Inc., $5.3 million from BFN Operations LLC and $1.8 million from Forest Park Medical Center at Fort Worth. The $2.8 million of positive fair value adjustments were primarily driven by yield adjustments due to tightening credit spreads and higher bid quotations on our syndicated credits. The $(10.2) million of negative credit-related adjustments included unrealized losses from the Forest Park Medical Center at San Antonio, Badlands Production Company and Speed Commerce Investment Partners investments in the amounts of $(3.9) million, $(3.8) million and $(1.7) million, respectively. The $(3.6) million of market-related adjustments was comprised of $(2.2) million from our equity investment in Prosper Marketplace, $(0.8) million from Rooster Energy Inc., $(0.3) million from Confluence Outdoors, LLC and $(0.3) million from Profusion Industries, LLC.\n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs; \n 71 \nAs of December 31, 2016, we held investments in 58 portfolio companies with a fair value of $376.7 million, including investments in 41 portfolio companies held through the 2016-2 CLO. The investments held by the 2016-2 CLO as of December 31, 2016 consisted of senior secured loans fair valued at $260.2 million and related indebtedness of $164.3 million. As of that date, the loans held by the 2016-2 CLO (held at fair value), together with cash and other assets held by the 2016-2 CLO, equaled approximately $275.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.9% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 37 months.\n \u2022 Under the Staffing Agreement, Garrison Investment Group provides Garrison Capital Advisers with the resources necessary to fulfill these obligations. The Staffing Agreement provides that Garrison Investment Group will make available to Garrison Capital Advisers experienced investment professionals and access to the senior investment personnel of Garrison Investment Group for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of Garrison Capital Advisers' investment committee serve in such capacity. The Staffing Agreement remains in effect until terminated and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided to Garrison Capital Advisers on a direct cost reimbursement basis, and such fees are not our obligation. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized net gains on investments of $10.7 million. Net realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven primarily by $8.4 million of realized gains incurred from the sale of the parent company of one portfolio company, Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, Inc., resulting in the early full repayment of the debt and sale of the equity, with the remaining net realized gain of $2.3 million resulting from the sale of 15 portfolio investments, early full repayment of 33 portfolio investments and other partial repayments.\nThe valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by the independent valuation firms each quarter. When an external event with respect to one of our portfolio companies, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we expect to use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation .\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash decreased by $(14.6) million as a result of net cash provided by operating activities of $37.0 million offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $(51.6) million.\n (1) Does not include any return of capital for tax purposes. \nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $19.1 million, $29.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. Net investment income decreased by $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, as described below under Total Investment Income\u201d and Expenses.\u201d\nAs a business development company and a RIC, we are subject to certain constraints on our operations, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, cash remained unchanged as a result of net cash provided by operating activities of $3.3 million offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $3.3 million.\n Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Investment Adviser's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair values of investments) \n______________\n 73 \nOur portfolio consists of primarily debt investments and unsecured consumer loans. The fair value of our investments is initially determined by investment professionals of our Investment Adviser and ultimately determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis.\nUpon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Facility fees, sometimes referred to as asset management fees, are accrued as a percentage periodic fee on the base amount (either the funded facility amount or the committed principal amount). Commitment fees are based upon the undrawn portion committed by us and are accrued over the life of the loan.\n \u2022 our future operating results; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n 74 \n 68 \n \u2022 transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; \n \u2022 costs of holding stockholder meetings; \nUpon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Facility fees, sometimes referred to as asset management fees, are accrued as a percentage periodic fee on the base amount (either the funded facility amount or the committed principal amount). Commitment fees are based upon the undrawn portion committed by us and are accrued over the life of the loan.\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest earned on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains and distributions, if any, on the equity interests or warrants that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche or mezzanine loans, typically have a term of one to six years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest is generally payable quarterly or semiannually, and in some cases, loans may have a PIK feature. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of loan origination, prepayment, facility, commitment, forbearance and amendment fees. We also may receive structuring or diligence fees, consulting fees and possibly fees for providing managerial assistance. Origination fees received by us are initially deferred and reduced from the cost basis of the investment and subsequently accreted into interest income over the remaining stated term of the loan.\nWe value our investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820's definition of fair value focuses on exit price in the principal, or most advantageous, market and prioritizes the use of market-based inputs over entity-specific inputs within a measurement of fair value. ASC Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\n \u2022 the impact of investments that we expect to make; \nRevenues\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. We have identified the following as critical accounting policies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nManagement fees decreased $(0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was driven by a reduction in total assets and the irrevocable waiver of certain fees during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures around these fee waivers.\nRecent Developments\nIncentive fees decreased $(1.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. Incentive fees decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the reversal of Income-based incentive fees that were subject to the Incentive Fee Cap & Deferral Mechanism, as a result of realized and unrealized losses on investments. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our incentive fee.\nOrigination fees received by us are initially deferred and reduced from the cost basis of the investment and subsequently accreted into interest income over the remaining stated term of the loan.\n 69 \nBoth the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other.\n \u2022 We have entered into the License Agreement with Garrison Investment Group pursuant to which Garrison Investment Group has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Garrison.\u201d \u2022 GLC Trust 2013-2 entered into the GLC Trust 2013-2 Administration Agreement with the Administrator, fees incurred under this agreement are included in total administrator expenses presented on the consolidated statement of operations. \nOur primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of our common stock, payments of interest on our debt, and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings and our transitory portfolio as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to fund our anticipated funding requirements through at least December 31, 2017.\nIn addition to proceeds from public and private offerings of our debt and equity securities, we have identified three portfolio companies with a total par value of $10.0 million and a fair value of $9.9 million which we view as transitory investments. Transitory investments are generally those investments that we view as an additional source of liquidity that we are able to sell in order to fund investments that fit our core investment strategy. These transitory investments are generally at the lower end of our target portfolio yield range.\nInterest Expense\nIncentive fees decreased $(7.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. Incentive fees decreased in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the reversal of Capital Gains based incentive fees that were previously accrued under U.S. GAAP and the reversal of Income-based incentive fees that were subject to the Incentive Fee Cap & Deferral Mechanism. These reversals were driven by realized and unrealized losses on investments.\nBasis for Consolidation\nOn February 28, 2017 the Board approved a distribution in the amount of $4.5 million, or $0.28 a share, which will be paid on March 30, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March 23, 2017.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn valuing our debt investments, the Investment Adviser generally uses various approaches, including proprietary models that consider the analyses of independent valuation agents as well as credit risk, liquidity, market credit spreads, other applicable factors for similar transactions and bid quotations obtained from other financial institutions that trade in similar investments or based on bid prices provided by independent third party pricing services.\nSome of the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:\n 77 \nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016, we made investments of $15.7 million to two new portfolio companies and $2.9 million of add-on investments to existing portfolio companies resulting in aggregate $18.6 million of portfolio additions at a weighted average yield of 8.0%. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, repayments in our portfolio consisted of seven early full repayments and partial repayments and sales totaling an aggregate par of $42.8 million with a weighted average yield of 11.5%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 In connection with the 2016-2 CLO, we retained the Investment Adviser to furnish collateral management sub-management services to us pursuant to a sub-collateral management agreement. The Investment Adviser does not receive a fee for providing such services. \u2022 Effective as of October 1, 2016, the Investment Adviser, in consultation with our board of directors agreed to irrevocably waive any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement with respect to a calendar quarter in excess of the sum of (i) 0.375% per quarter (1.50% annualized) of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, calculated based on the average carrying value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, (ii) 20% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, in excess of a hurdle rate\u201d of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized) and (iii) in the case of the final calendar quarter of each year, the capital gains incentive fee. This waiver will be in effect until the earlier of (i) June 30, 2017 and (ii) approval by our stockholders of an amendment to the Investment Advisory Agreement to decrease the base management fee to an annual rate of 1.50% and to decrease the hurdle rate\u201d for the income-based portion of the Incentive Fee to 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). \nThe following table shows select information of our portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\n 67 \nWe have adopted a joint code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and our Investment Adviser's officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the DGCL.\n \u2022 the impact of increased competition; \n\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by making investments generally in the range of $5.0 million to $25.0 million primarily in debt securities and loans of U.S. based middle-market companies, which we define as those having EBITDA of between $5.0 million and $50.0 million. Our goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by assembling a broad portfolio of investments.\n \u2022 dues, fees and charges of any trade association of which we are a member; and \nAs a business development company, we elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and intend to qualify annually for such treatment.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the net change in unrealized loss on investments was $(21.9) million. The net change in unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by $(20.8) million of negative credit related adjustment of four portfolio investments, $(4.0) million of negative market-related adjustment on 20 portfolio investments, a net $(1.3) million reversal of prior period unrealized gains resulting from the full repayment of five portfolio investments and the partial sale of one portfolio investment and $(0.4) million negative adjustment related to the GLC Trust consumer loan portfolio. This was offset by $4.3 million from the reversal of prior period unrealized losses resulting from the significant restructuring of two portfolio investments, and an increase of $0.4 million in the value of two portfolio investment. The remaining net change in unrealized loss on investments was due to the decrease in the market value of the remaining portfolio in the amount of $(0.1) million.\n \u2022 Garrison Capital Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the increase in total expenses of $2.5 million was driven primarily by (i) non-recurring expenses in the amount of $3.4 million related to the refinancing of the 2013-2 CLO and (ii) higher interest expense on our debt outstanding offset by lower management and incentive fees recorded.\n \u2022 directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and our Investment Adviser. \n 62 \nAs of December 31, 2015, we held investments in 67 portfolio companies with a fair value of $415.0 million, including investments in 50 portfolio companies held through the 2013-2 CLO. The investments held by the 2013-2 CLO as of December 31, 2015 consisted of senior secured loans fair valued at $306.6 million and related indebtedness of $194.8 million. As of that date, the loans held by the 2013-2 CLO (held at fair value), together with cash and other assets held by the 2013-2 CLO, equaled approximately $323.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.8% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 44 months.\nExpenses related to, but not limited to, ratings expenses, due diligence, valuation expenses and independent collateral appraisals may arise when we make certain investments. These expenses, as well as insurance expenses and trustee expenses are recognized as incurred in the consolidated statements of operations within other expenses.\n\n \u2022 The valuation committee of the board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. \nThe types of factors that the board of directors may take into account when reviewing the fair value initially derived by the Investment Adviser and determining the fair value of our consumer loan investments generally include, as appropriate, prepayment and default rates derived from historical performance, actual performance as compared to historical projections and discount rates.\n \u2022 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, which could result in changes to the value of our assets; \nThe Administrator also manages the determination and publication of our net asset value, the preparation and filing of our tax returns and generally monitors the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. The Administrator may retain third parties to assist in providing administrative services to us. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any profit to the Administrator.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,758,779, the net increase in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.82.\nPortfolio Activity\n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs and expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs. \n 63 \n \u2022 the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures. \nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had cash of $10.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively. Also, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had restricted cash of $12.6 million and $11.8 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized a net loss on investments of $(11.7) million. Net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily driven by $(8.5) million of realized losses incurred from the significant restructurings of two portfolio investments, a realized loss of $(4.4) million from the early full repayment of one portfolio investment, and $(2.8) million of realized losses in GLC Trust 2013-2's consumer loan portfolio. This was offset by a $2.5 million realized gain incurred from the partial sale of one portfolio investment and net realized gains of $1.5 million incurred from the early full repayment of 17 portfolio investments, the sale of one portfolio investment and other partial repayments.\n 60 \nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the average adjusted value of our gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\n \u2022 independent director fees and expenses; \nThe decrease in interest income was largely driven by our non-performing assets and lower investment balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was primarily driven by lower prepayment and amendment fees recognized during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nOur board of directors has retained several independent valuation firms to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation at least once during each 12-month period. To the extent a security is reviewed in a particular quarter, it is reviewed and valued by only one service provider. However, our board of directors does not intend to have de minimis investments of less than 0.5% of our total assets (up to an aggregate of 10% of our total assets) independently reviewed. Our board of directors is responsible for determining the fair value of our assets in good faith using a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process.\nNet assets could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of the investments were materially higher or lower than the values that are ultimately realized upon the disposal of such investments.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,742,531, the net decrease in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $(0.22).\n 61 \nWe have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our board of directors declares a cash dividend or other distribution, then our stockholders who have not \u2018opted out' of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution.\nNet (Decrease) / Increase in Net Assets from Operations", "item_7_text": "With respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our board of directors will undertake a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\nAs of December 31, 2016, we held investments in 58 portfolio companies with a fair value of $376.7 million. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.9% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 37 months.\n 76 \nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n Level 2 - other significant observable inputs (including quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayments, credit risk, etc.) \nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end management investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the 1940 Act. In addition, for tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of Code and intend to qualify annually for such treatment. Our shares are currently listed on The NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol GARS\u201d.\nWe accrue interest income if we expect that ultimately we will be able to collect it. Generally, when an interest default occurs on a loan in our portfolio, or if our management otherwise believes that the issuer of the loan will not be able to service the loan and other obligations, we will place the loan on non-accrual status and will cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal and interest is current through payment or until a restructuring occurs, such that the interest income is deemed to be collectible. However, we remain contractually entitled to this interest. We may make exceptions to this policy if the loan has sufficient collateral value and is in the process of collection. Accrued interest is written off when it becomes probable that the interest will not be collected and the amount of uncollectible interest can be reasonably estimated. For consumer loans, any loan which is 120 days past due is considered defaulted and 100% of the principal is charged off with no expected recovery or sale of defaulted receivables. We had two investments placed on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2016 and four investments placed on non-accrual status as of December 31, 2015.\nDuring periods of asset growth, we expect our general and administrative expenses to be relatively stable or decline as a percentage of total assets and increase during periods of asset declines.\nTotal Investment Income\nRelated Party Transactions\nOther Expenses\n \u2022 taxes; \nInterest expense increased $0.9 million, for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase in the average effective interest rate on debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the weighted average effective interest rate for total outstanding debt was 3.88% and 3.20%, respectively.\n______________\n \u2022 the effects of applicable legislation and regulations and changes thereto; \n \u2022 We entered into the Investment Advisory Agreement with Garrison Capital Advisers LLC, under which our Investment Adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on prospective investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities resulted mainly from net investment income in the amount of $19.1 million, repayments and sales of investments in the amount of $107.2 million and $34.1 million, respectively, offset by purchases of investments in the amount of $123.9 million, and net realized loss from investments in the amount of $30.6 million. Net cash used in financing activities resulted from cash distributions in the amount of $21.5 million, repayment of the senior secured revolving notes of the CLOs in the amount of $35.0 million, repayment of the GLC Trust 2013-2 Class A notes in the amount of $10.9 million, repurchases of common stock in the amount of $5.0 million and debt issuance costs of $2.8 million, offset by proceeds from the Garrison SBIC borrowings in the amount of $17.7 million and net proceeds from the borrowing on senior secured term notes of the CLOs in the amount of $6.0 million.\nWe have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following:\nThe valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by the independent valuation firms each quarter.\nInvestment Transactions and Related Investment Income and Expense\nNo action is required on the part of a registered stockholder to have their cash dividend or other distribution reinvested in shares of our common stock. A registered stockholder may elect to receive an entire distribution in cash by notifying American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC, the plan administrator and our transfer agent and registrar, in writing so that such notice is received by the plan administrator no later than the record date for distributions to stockholders. The plan administrator will set up an account for shares acquired through the plan for each stockholder who has not elected to receive dividends or other distributions in cash and hold such shares in non-certificated form. Upon request by a stockholder participating in the plan, received in writing not less than 10 days prior to the record date, the plan administrator will, instead of crediting shares to the participant's account, issue a certificate registered in the participant's name for the number of whole shares of our common stock and a check for any fractional share. The plan administrator is authorized to deduct a $15.00 transaction fee plus a $0.10 per share brokerage commission from the proceeds of the sale of any fractional share of common stock.\nYou should understand that, under Section 27A(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Act and Section 21E(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, the safe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 do not apply to statements made in connection with this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any periodic reports we file under the Exchange Act.\nExpenses\nDue to the nature of our strategy, our portfolio includes relatively illiquid investments that are privately held. Inputs into the determination of fair value of our portfolio investments require significant management judgment or estimation. This means that our portfolio valuations are based on unobservable inputs and our own assumptions about how market participants would price the asset or liability in question. Valuations of privately held investments are inherently uncertain, may fluctuate over short periods of time and may be based on estimates. The determination of fair value by our board of directors may differ materially from the values that would have been used if a ready market for these investments existed. Our net asset value could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of our investments were materially higher or lower than the values that we ultimately realized upon the disposal of such investments.\nIn valuing our unsecured consumer loans, the Investment Adviser generally uses a discounted cash flow methodology based upon a set of assumptions. The primary assumptions used to value the unsecured consumer loans include prepayment and default rates derived from historical performance, actual performance as compared to historical projections and discount rates.\n \u2022 our contractual arrangements and relationships with third parties; \nThose stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends and other distributions in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.\n \u2022 Our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by investment professionals of our Investment Adviser responsible for credit monitoring. \nThe $3.4 million of non-recurring expenses related to the refinancing of the 2013-2 CLO was comprised of (i) a $1.8 million write-off of third party expenses associated with our 2013-2 CLO which had been previously deferred and were being amortized over the stated life of the 2013-2 CLO and (ii) the acceleration of $1.6 million of third party expenses associated with the execution of the 2016-2 CLO.\n \u2022 our organization; \n \u2022 the relative and absolute performance of our Investment Adviser, including in identifying suitable investments for us; \nShare Repurchase\nDistributions\nOur investment activities are managed by Garrison Capital Advisers LLC, our Investment Adviser. The six member investment committee of our Investment Adviser is comprised of Joseph Tansey, Brian Chase, Mitch Drucker, Susan George, Robert Chimenti and Joshua Brandt. Our Investment Adviser is responsible for sourcing potential investments, conducting research and diligence on prospective investments and equity sponsors, analyzing investment opportunities, structuring our investments and monitoring our investments and portfolio companies on an ongoing basis. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, we pay a base management fee and an incentive fee to our Investment Adviser for its services. The Administrator provides certain administrative services and facilities necessary for us to operate, including office facilities and equipment and clerical, bookkeeping and record-keeping services, pursuant to the Administration Agreement. The Administrator oversees our financial reporting and prepares our reports to stockholders and reports required to be filed with the SEC.\n \u2022 fees and expenses, including travel expenses, incurred by the Investment Adviser or payable to third parties in performing due diligence on prospective portfolio companies, monitoring our investments and, if necessary, enforcing our rights; \n \u2022 amounts payable to third parties relating to, or associated with, evaluating, making and disposing of investments; \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe may become a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of our business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. These instruments may include commitments to extend credit and involve, to varying degrees, elements of liquidity and credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $4.8 million and $6.9 million of outstanding commitments to fund such investments, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $22.9 million and $36.8 million of cash and restricted cash, respectively.\n \u2022 our ability to make distributions to our stockholders; \nWe record our investment transactions on a trade date basis, which is the date when we have determined that all material terms have been defined for the transactions. These transactions could possibly settle on a subsequent date depending on the transaction type. All related revenue and expenses attributable to these transactions are reflected on the consolidated statements of operations commencing on the trade date unless otherwise specified by the transaction documents. Realized gains and losses on investment transactions are recorded on the specific identification method.\nLoan Origination, Facility, Commitment and Amendment Fees\nExpenses\n\n \u2022 costs associated with our reporting and compliance obligations under the 1940 Act and applicable U.S. federal and state securities laws; \n \u2022 the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; \n \u2022 direct costs and expenses of administration and operation, including audit and legal costs; \nAs a business development company, we distribute substantially all of our net income to our stockholders and will have an ongoing need to raise additional capital for investment purposes. We generate cash primarily from offerings of our equity securities and the issuance of debt securities including the 2016-2 Notes, as described below, Garrison SBIC Debentures and any repayments of portfolio investments. In addition, our cash flows from operations, including interest earned from the temporary investment of cash in U.S. government securities and other high-quality debt investments that mature in one year or less also provide liquidity.\nGarrison Funding 2013-2 Manager LLC owns a 100% economic interest in Garrison Funding 2013-2 Ltd., which was an investment company for accounting purposes, and also provided collateral management services solely to Garrison Funding 2013-2 Ltd.. As such, we consolidated the accounts of these entities into these consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, the amounts outstanding under the 2013-2 CLO are treated as our indebtedness.\nWe use words such as anticipate,\u201d believe,\u201d expect,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d might,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d can,\u201d would,\u201d believe,\u201d estimate,\u201d anticipate,\u201d predict,\u201d potential\u201d and similar words to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth as Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTotal investment income increased by $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 due to an increase in interest income in the amount of $1.5 million, offset by a decrease in dividend income in the amount of $(0.4) million and a decrease in net accretion from the amortization of discounts in the amount of $(0.2) million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash increased by $11.3 million as a result of net cash provided by operating activities of $49.5 million offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $(38.2) million.\n \u2022 the dependence of our future success on the general economy, including general economic trends, and its impact on the industries in which we invest; \nInflation has not had a significant effect on our results of operations in any of the reporting periods presented in our financial statements. However, from time to time, inflation may impact the operating results of our portfolio companies.\n______________\n \u2022 litigation, indemnification and other non-recurring or extraordinary expenses; \nIncome Tax\nThe following table summarizes our expenses, net of fee waivers and excluding the losses on the refinancing of the secured notes offered in the 2013-2 CLO and the $10.0 million revolving facility of GLC Trust 2013-2, or the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2014, respectively, and the acceleration of deferred financing costs included in interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.\n\n \u2022 distributions on our shares; \nShare repurchase transactions are recorded on a trade date basis, which is the date when management has determined that all material legal terms have been contractually defined for the transactions. The aggregate cost of common stock repurchased, including any direct transaction costs, will be recorded as a reduction of the par and paid-in-capital in excess of par value accounts, respectively.\n \u2022 At least once annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available quotation is reviewed by an independent valuation firm, subject to the de minimis exception above. \n Level 1 - quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical investments as of the reporting date \nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we made investments of $101.3 million to 12 new portfolio companies and $14.0 million of add-on investments to existing portfolio companies resulting in aggregate $115.3 million of portfolio additions at a weighted average yield of 10.0%. For the year ended December 31, 2016, repayments in our portfolio consisted of 17 early full repayments and partial repayments and sales totaling an aggregate par of $139.1 million with a weighted average yield of 10.2%.\nInflation\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the net change in unrealized loss on investments was $(2.2) million. The net change in unrealized loss for year ended December 31, 2014 was driven primarily by the reversal of prior period unrealized gain in the amount of $(1.8) million as a result of the sale of the parent company of Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, Inc. and the negative credit related adjustment of three portfolio investments in the amount of $(5.3) million, offset by the increase in value of two portfolio investments in the amount of $6.1 million. The remaining net change in unrealized loss on investments was due to the reversal of prior period unrealized loss of $0.3 million and the decrease in the market value of the remaining portfolio in the amount of $(1.5) million.\n 70 \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities resulted mainly from net investment income in the amount of $29.9 million, repayments and sales of investments in the amount of $198.2 million and $6.1 million, respectively, offset by purchases of investments in the amount of $181.0 million, and realized losses in the amount of $11.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities resulted from cash distributions in the amount of $23.4 million, repayment of the senior secured revolving notes in the amount of $15.0 million, repayment of the GLC Trust 2013-2 Class A notes in the amount of $14.9 million, repurchases of common stock in the amount of $3.3 million, and debt issuance costs of $0.8 million, offset by proceeds from the Garrison SBIC borrowings in the amount of $19.3 million.\nTotal investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $43.0 million, $51.3 million and $50.5 million, respectively.\n 75 \nThe GARS Equity Holdings Entities, Walnut Hill II LLC, Forest Park II LLC, Garrison SBIC and GLC Trust 2013-2 are 100% owned investment companies for accounting purposes. As such, we have consolidated the accounts of these entities into these consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, indebtedness of Garrison SBIC and the amounts outstanding under the GLC Trust 2013-2 Notes are treated as our indebtedness.\n\nInterest expense increased $0.3 million, for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, due to an increase in the average effective interest rate on debt outstanding. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the weighted average effective interest rate for total outstanding debt was 3.20% and 3.04%, respectively.\nThe increase in interest income was largely driven by an increase in the weighted average yield of our debt investments to 10.8% in 2015 from 10.5% in 2014. The decrease in dividend income was primarily driven by decrease in dividend income from one portfolio investment that was sold in 2014.\n \u2022 the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our prospective portfolio companies; and \nTotal expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $23.9 million, $21.4 million and $28.5 million, respectively.\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of (1) the base management fee and incentive fee to the Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement; (2) the allocable portion of overhead to the Administrator under the Administration Agreement; (3) the interest expense on our outstanding debt, if any; and (4) our other operating costs, as detailed below. We bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, including:\nIf any of the contractual obligations discussed above are terminated, our costs under any new agreements that we enter into may increase. In addition, we would likely incur significant time and expense in locating alternative parties to provide the services we expect to receive under our Investment Advisory Agreement and our Administration Agreement. Any new investment advisory agreement would also be subject to approval by our stockholders.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2016, we realized a net loss on investments of $(30.6) million. Net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily driven by a $(12.7) million loss in connection with the restructuring of our investment in Speed Commerce Inc., a $(11.1) million loss on BFN Operations LLC, a $(5.8) million loss on Forest Park Medical Center at Fort Worth, a $(1.3) million loss on SC Academy Holdings, Inc. and $(1.3) million of realized losses in the GLC Trust 2013-2's consumer loan portfolio. This was partially offset by a $0.3 million realized gain on Ellman International, Inc., a $0.3 million realized gain on Provo Craft Holdings, LLC and $1.0 million of gains from the partial and full repayments and sales of other portfolio investments.\nThe following tables reflect the cash distributions per share that we have declared on our common stock for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\nWe entered into the Administration Agreement on October 9, 2012 with the Administrator. Under the Administration Agreement, the Administrator furnishes us with office facilities and equipment, provides us clerical, bookkeeping and record keeping services and provides us with other administrative services necessary to conduct our day-to-day operations.\n (1) Includes $7.0 million of interim financings which mature on March 29, 2017, upon which we expect them to be pooled in ten year, SBA-guaranteed debentures. \nNet Investment Income\nGarrison Capital Inc. owns a 100% economic interest in GF 2016-2, which was an investment company for accounting purposes, and also provides collateral management services solely to GF 2016-2. As such, hawse have consolidated the accounts of these entities into its consolidated financial statements. As a result of this consolidation, the amounts outstanding under the 2016-2 CLO are treated as our indebtedness.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,149,866, the net decrease in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $(0.31). This decrease was primarily driven by net realized losses from investments incurred during the year ended December 31, 2016.\n \u2022 our fidelity bond; \nWe invest primarily in (1) first lien senior secured loans, (2) second lien senior secured loans, (3) one-stop\u201d senior secured or unitranche\u201d loans, (4) subordinated or mezzanine loans, (5) unsecured consumer loans and (6) to a lesser extent, selected equity co-investments in middle-market companies. We use the term one-stop\u201d or unitranche\u201d to refer to a loan that combines characteristics of traditional first lien senior secured loans and second lien or subordinated loans. We use the term mezzanine\u201d to refer to a loan that ranks senior only to a borrower's equity securities and ranks junior in right of payment to all of such borrower's other indebtedness.\nManagement fees decreased $(0.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the decrease in total assets.\n \u2022 calculating our net asset value and net asset value per share (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firms); \nValuation of Portfolio Investments\n 64 \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities resulted mainly from net investment income in the amount of $22.0 million, realized gains in the amount of $10.7 million, repayments and sales of investments in the amount of $293.8 million and $105.6 million, respectively, as well as a decrease in due from counterparties in the amount of $5.1 million, offset by purchases of investments in the amount of $427.1 million and a decrease in due to counterparties in the amount of $7.7 million. Net cash used in financing activities resulted from cash distributions in the amount of $23.5 million, repayment of the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver in the amount of $9.7 million and debt issuance costs of $0.5 million, offset by proceeds from the GLC Trust 2013-2 Notes in the amount of $30.4 million.\n \u2022 listing fees; \nWe intend to comply with all RIC qualification provisions contained in the Code including certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements as well as the Annual Distribution Requirements. As a RIC, we do not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our stockholders in a timely manner. However, we are subject to U.S. federal income taxes at regular corporate tax rates on any net ordinary income or net capital gain not distributed to our stockholders assuming we meet the Annual Distribution Requirement.\n 65 \n \u2022 brokerage fees and commissions; \n \u2022 our expected financings and investments; \nAmendment and forbearance fees are paid in connection with loan amendments and waivers and are recognized upon completion of the amendments or waivers, generally when such fees are receivable. Any such fees are recorded and classified as other income and included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. As these fees are paid and recognized in connection with specific loan amendments or forbearance, they are typically non-recurring in nature.\nThe types of factors that the board of directors may take into account when reviewing the fair value initially derived by the Investment Adviser and determining the fair value of the our debt investments generally include, as appropriate, comparison to publicly traded securities, including such factors as yield, maturity and measures of credit quality, the enterprise value of a portfolio company, the nature and realizable value of any collateral, the portfolio company's ability to make payments and its earnings and discounted cash flow, the markets in which the portfolio company does business and other relevant factors.\nAdministrator expenses increased $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015 due primarily to higher overhead staffing costs. Administrator expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $0.3 million from the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily driven by higher allocation of overhead costs due to the hiring of additional personnel.\nWe had a net asset value per common share outstanding on December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 of $12.42, $13.98 and $15.58, respectively.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Garrison Capital Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accounts of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as us using consistent accounting policies. Under the investment company rules and regulations pursuant to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Audit and Accounting Guide for Investment Companies, codified in ASC Topic 946, we are precluded from consolidating any entity other than another investment company.\nAny original issue discounts, as well as any other purchase discounts or premiums on debt investments, are accreted or amortized and included in interest income over the maturity periods of the investments.\nWe believe that the middle market offers attractive risk-adjusted returns for debt investors. Historically, we believe there has been a persistent scarcity of available capital relative to demand, which, from a lender's perspective, has generally resulted in more favorable transaction structures, including enhanced covenant protection and increased pricing relative to larger companies. In addition, we believe that middle-market companies traditionally have exhibited lower default rates and improved recoveries compared to larger borrowers and typically offer greater access to key senior managers, which we believe further enhances the attractiveness of lending to this market segment and facilitates due diligence investigations and regular monitoring.\n 66 \n \u2022 our business prospects and the prospects of our current and prospective portfolio companies; \nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had $4.8 million and $6.9 million of unfunded commitments, respectively, with a fair value of $(0.1) million and $(0.1) million, respectively. These amounts may or may not be funded to the borrowing party now or in the future. The unfunded commitments relate to loans with various maturity dates, but the entire amount was eligible for funding to the borrowers as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, subject to the terms of each loan's respective credit agreement.\n \u2022 the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; \nConsolidated operating results for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 are as follows:\n 72 \nPortfolio Composition and Select Portfolio Information\nWe may receive loan origination fees when making a new investment, as well as prepayment, facility, commitment, forbearance, and amendment fees during the life of the investment.\n (1) Does not include any return of capital for tax purposes. \nAmendment and forbearance fees are paid in connection with loan amendments and waivers and are recognized upon completion of the amendments or waivers, generally when such fees are receivable. Any such fees are recorded and classified as other income and included in investment income on the consolidated statements of operations. As these fees are paid and recognized in connection with specific loan amendments or forbearance, they are typically non-recurring in nature.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held investments in 67 portfolio companies with a fair value of $415.0 million. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.8% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 44 months.\nWe have based the forward-looking statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K on information available to us on the date of this report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K.\nTotal investment income decreased by $(8.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015 due to a decrease in interest income in the amount of $(6.9) million and a decrease in other income of $(1.5) million.\n \u2022 offerings of our common stock and other securities; \nInterest expense is recorded on an accrual basis and is adjusted for amortization of deferred debt issuance costs.\nSubject to leverage and borrowing base restrictions, as of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $25.0 million available for additional borrowings under our senior secured revolving notes of the 2016-2 CLO, $33.0 million of available SBIC leverage and no available borrowings under the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $15.0 million available for additional borrowings under our senior secured revolving notes of the 2013-2 CLO, $15.7 million of available SBIC leverage and no available borrowings under the GLC Trust 2013-2 Revolver.\n \u2022 registration fees; \nWe generally consolidate any investment company when we own 100% of its partners' or members' capital or equity units or 100% of the economic equity interest. ASC Topic 946 provides for the consolidation of a controlled operating company that provides substantially all of its services to the investment company or its consolidated subsidiaries.\n \u2022 The board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith. \nDepending on the level of taxable income earned in a tax year, we may choose to retain taxable income in excess of current year dividend distributions, and would distribute such taxable income in the next tax year. We would then pay a 4% excise tax on such taxable income, as required. To the extent that we determine that its estimated current year annual taxable income, determined on a calendar basis, could exceed estimated current calendar year dividend distributions, we accrue excise tax, if any, on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned. For the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, $0.1 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively, was recorded for U.S. federal excise tax, respectively.\nThe net change in unrealized gain on investments of $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily driven by $16.9 million from the reversal of prior period net unrealized losses across 16 investments and positive fair value adjustments of $3.6 million, partially offset by $(10.2) million of negative credit-related adjustments across 6 portfolio investments and $(3.6) million of negative market-related adjustments across 4 portfolio investments. The $16.9 million of reversals of prior period net unrealized losses included $9.8 million from Speed Commerce, Inc., $5.3 million from BFN Operations LLC and $1.8 million from Forest Park Medical Center at Fort Worth. The $2.8 million of positive fair value adjustments were primarily driven by yield adjustments due to tightening credit spreads and higher bid quotations on our syndicated credits. The $(10.2) million of negative credit-related adjustments included unrealized losses from the Forest Park Medical Center at San Antonio, Badlands Production Company and Speed Commerce Investment Partners investments in the amounts of $(3.9) million, $(3.8) million and $(1.7) million, respectively. The $(3.6) million of market-related adjustments was comprised of $(2.2) million from our equity investment in Prosper Marketplace, $(0.8) million from Rooster Energy Inc., $(0.3) million from Confluence Outdoors, LLC and $(0.3) million from Profusion Industries, LLC.\n \u2022 the costs of any reports, proxy statements or other notices to our stockholders, including printing costs; \n 71 \nAs of December 31, 2016, we held investments in 58 portfolio companies with a fair value of $376.7 million, including investments in 41 portfolio companies held through the 2016-2 CLO. The investments held by the 2016-2 CLO as of December 31, 2016 consisted of senior secured loans fair valued at $260.2 million and related indebtedness of $164.3 million. As of that date, the loans held by the 2016-2 CLO (held at fair value), together with cash and other assets held by the 2016-2 CLO, equaled approximately $275.6 million. As of December 31, 2016, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.9% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 37 months.\n \u2022 Under the Staffing Agreement, Garrison Investment Group provides Garrison Capital Advisers with the resources necessary to fulfill these obligations. The Staffing Agreement provides that Garrison Investment Group will make available to Garrison Capital Advisers experienced investment professionals and access to the senior investment personnel of Garrison Investment Group for purposes of evaluating, negotiating, structuring, closing and monitoring our investments. The Staffing Agreement also includes a commitment that the members of Garrison Capital Advisers' investment committee serve in such capacity. The Staffing Agreement remains in effect until terminated and may be terminated by either party without penalty upon 60 days' written notice to the other party. Services under the Staffing Agreement are provided to Garrison Capital Advisers on a direct cost reimbursement basis, and such fees are not our obligation. \nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, we realized net gains on investments of $10.7 million. Net realized gains for the year ended December 31, 2014 were driven primarily by $8.4 million of realized gains incurred from the sale of the parent company of one portfolio company, Anchor Drilling Fluids USA, Inc., resulting in the early full repayment of the debt and sale of the equity, with the remaining net realized gain of $2.3 million resulting from the sale of 15 portfolio investments, early full repayment of 33 portfolio investments and other partial repayments.\nThe valuation process is conducted at the end of each fiscal quarter, with a portion of our valuations of portfolio companies without market quotations subject to review by the independent valuation firms each quarter. When an external event with respect to one of our portfolio companies, such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, we expect to use the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate our valuation .\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash decreased by $(14.6) million as a result of net cash provided by operating activities of $37.0 million offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $(51.6) million.\n (1) Does not include any return of capital for tax purposes. \nNet investment income for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was $19.1 million, $29.9 million and $22.0 million, respectively. Net investment income decreased by $10.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015, and increased $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014, as described below under Total Investment Income\u201d and Expenses.\u201d\nAs a business development company and a RIC, we are subject to certain constraints on our operations, including limitations imposed by the 1940 Act and the Code.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, cash remained unchanged as a result of net cash provided by operating activities of $3.3 million offset by cash used in financing activities in the amount of $3.3 million.\n Level 3 - significant unobservable inputs (including the Investment Adviser's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in determining the fair values of investments) \n______________\n 73 \nOur portfolio consists of primarily debt investments and unsecured consumer loans. The fair value of our investments is initially determined by investment professionals of our Investment Adviser and ultimately determined by our board of directors on a quarterly basis.\nUpon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Facility fees, sometimes referred to as asset management fees, are accrued as a percentage periodic fee on the base amount (either the funded facility amount or the committed principal amount). Commitment fees are based upon the undrawn portion committed by us and are accrued over the life of the loan.\n \u2022 our future operating results; \n \u2022 fees and expenses associated with marketing efforts; \n 74 \n 68 \n \u2022 transfer agent and custody fees and expenses; \n \u2022 costs of holding stockholder meetings; \nUpon the prepayment of a loan or debt security, any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income when we receive such amounts. Facility fees, sometimes referred to as asset management fees, are accrued as a percentage periodic fee on the base amount (either the funded facility amount or the committed principal amount). Commitment fees are based upon the undrawn portion committed by us and are accrued over the life of the loan.\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest earned on the debt investments that we hold and capital gains and distributions, if any, on the equity interests or warrants that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments, whether in the form of senior secured, unitranche or mezzanine loans, typically have a term of one to six years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest is generally payable quarterly or semiannually, and in some cases, loans may have a PIK feature. The principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of loan origination, prepayment, facility, commitment, forbearance and amendment fees. We also may receive structuring or diligence fees, consulting fees and possibly fees for providing managerial assistance. Origination fees received by us are initially deferred and reduced from the cost basis of the investment and subsequently accreted into interest income over the remaining stated term of the loan.\nWe value our investments in accordance with ASC Topic 820. ASC Topic 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value. ASC Topic 820's definition of fair value focuses on exit price in the principal, or most advantageous, market and prioritizes the use of market-based inputs over entity-specific inputs within a measurement of fair value. ASC Topic 820 classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy:\n \u2022 the impact of investments that we expect to make; \nRevenues\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic environment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. We have identified the following as critical accounting policies.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nManagement fees decreased $(0.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease was driven by a reduction in total assets and the irrevocable waiver of certain fees during the three months ended December 31, 2016. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures around these fee waivers.\nRecent Developments\nIncentive fees decreased $(1.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the year ended December 31, 2015. Incentive fees decreased in the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the reversal of Income-based incentive fees that were subject to the Incentive Fee Cap & Deferral Mechanism, as a result of realized and unrealized losses on investments. Refer to Note 8 of our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our incentive fee.\nOrigination fees received by us are initially deferred and reduced from the cost basis of the investment and subsequently accreted into interest income over the remaining stated term of the loan.\n 69 \nBoth the Investment Advisory Agreement and the Administration Agreement may be terminated by either party without penalty upon no fewer than 60 days' written notice to the other.\n \u2022 We have entered into the License Agreement with Garrison Investment Group pursuant to which Garrison Investment Group has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name Garrison.\u201d \u2022 GLC Trust 2013-2 entered into the GLC Trust 2013-2 Administration Agreement with the Administrator, fees incurred under this agreement are included in total administrator expenses presented on the consolidated statement of operations. \nOur primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies, cash distributions to holders of our common stock, payments of interest on our debt, and payments of fees and other operating expenses we incur. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, available borrowings and our transitory portfolio as of December 31, 2016 will be sufficient to fund our anticipated funding requirements through at least December 31, 2017.\nIn addition to proceeds from public and private offerings of our debt and equity securities, we have identified three portfolio companies with a total par value of $10.0 million and a fair value of $9.9 million which we view as transitory investments. Transitory investments are generally those investments that we view as an additional source of liquidity that we are able to sell in order to fund investments that fit our core investment strategy. These transitory investments are generally at the lower end of our target portfolio yield range.\nInterest Expense\nIncentive fees decreased $(7.3) million in the year ended December 31, 2015 from the year ended December 31, 2014. Incentive fees decreased in the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily driven by the reversal of Capital Gains based incentive fees that were previously accrued under U.S. GAAP and the reversal of Income-based incentive fees that were subject to the Incentive Fee Cap & Deferral Mechanism. These reversals were driven by realized and unrealized losses on investments.\nBasis for Consolidation\nOn February 28, 2017 the Board approved a distribution in the amount of $4.5 million, or $0.28 a share, which will be paid on March 30, 2017 to stockholders of record as of March 23, 2017.\nA summary of our significant contractual payment obligations as of December 31, 2016 is as follows:\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn valuing our debt investments, the Investment Adviser generally uses various approaches, including proprietary models that consider the analyses of independent valuation agents as well as credit risk, liquidity, market credit spreads, other applicable factors for similar transactions and bid quotations obtained from other financial institutions that trade in similar investments or based on bid prices provided by independent third party pricing services.\nSome of the statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K involve risks and uncertainties, including statements as to:\n 77 \nFor the three months ended December 31, 2016, we made investments of $15.7 million to two new portfolio companies and $2.9 million of add-on investments to existing portfolio companies resulting in aggregate $18.6 million of portfolio additions at a weighted average yield of 8.0%. For the three months ended December 31, 2016, repayments in our portfolio consisted of seven early full repayments and partial repayments and sales totaling an aggregate par of $42.8 million with a weighted average yield of 11.5%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n \u2022 In connection with the 2016-2 CLO, we retained the Investment Adviser to furnish collateral management sub-management services to us pursuant to a sub-collateral management agreement. The Investment Adviser does not receive a fee for providing such services. \u2022 Effective as of October 1, 2016, the Investment Adviser, in consultation with our board of directors agreed to irrevocably waive any fees payable to the Investment Adviser under the Investment Advisory Agreement with respect to a calendar quarter in excess of the sum of (i) 0.375% per quarter (1.50% annualized) of our gross assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed funds, calculated based on the average carrying value of our gross assets at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, (ii) 20% of Pre-Incentive Fee Net Investment Income, expressed as a rate of return on the value of our net assets at the end of the immediately preceding calendar quarter, in excess of a hurdle rate\u201d of 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized) and (iii) in the case of the final calendar quarter of each year, the capital gains incentive fee. This waiver will be in effect until the earlier of (i) June 30, 2017 and (ii) approval by our stockholders of an amendment to the Investment Advisory Agreement to decrease the base management fee to an annual rate of 1.50% and to decrease the hurdle rate\u201d for the income-based portion of the Incentive Fee to 1.75% per quarter (7.00% annualized). \nThe following table shows select information of our portfolio as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.\n 67 \nWe have adopted a joint code of ethics that governs the conduct of our and our Investment Adviser's officers, directors and employees. Our officers and directors also remain subject to the duties imposed by both the 1940 Act and the DGCL.\n \u2022 the impact of increased competition; \n\nNet Realized Gain (Loss) and Net Change in Unrealized Gain (Loss) on Investments\nOur investment objective is to generate current income and capital appreciation by making investments generally in the range of $5.0 million to $25.0 million primarily in debt securities and loans of U.S. based middle-market companies, which we define as those having EBITDA of between $5.0 million and $50.0 million. Our goal is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns by assembling a broad portfolio of investments.\n \u2022 dues, fees and charges of any trade association of which we are a member; and \nAs a business development company, we elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code, and intend to qualify annually for such treatment.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, the net change in unrealized loss on investments was $(21.9) million. The net change in unrealized loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by $(20.8) million of negative credit related adjustment of four portfolio investments, $(4.0) million of negative market-related adjustment on 20 portfolio investments, a net $(1.3) million reversal of prior period unrealized gains resulting from the full repayment of five portfolio investments and the partial sale of one portfolio investment and $(0.4) million negative adjustment related to the GLC Trust consumer loan portfolio. This was offset by $4.3 million from the reversal of prior period unrealized losses resulting from the significant restructuring of two portfolio investments, and an increase of $0.4 million in the value of two portfolio investment. The remaining net change in unrealized loss on investments was due to the decrease in the market value of the remaining portfolio in the amount of $(0.1) million.\n \u2022 Garrison Capital Administrator provides us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct day-to-day operations pursuant to our Administration Agreement. \nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, the increase in total expenses of $2.5 million was driven primarily by (i) non-recurring expenses in the amount of $3.4 million related to the refinancing of the 2013-2 CLO and (ii) higher interest expense on our debt outstanding offset by lower management and incentive fees recorded.\n \u2022 directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance and any other insurance premiums; \n \u2022 Preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and our Investment Adviser. \n 62 \nAs of December 31, 2015, we held investments in 67 portfolio companies with a fair value of $415.0 million, including investments in 50 portfolio companies held through the 2013-2 CLO. The investments held by the 2013-2 CLO as of December 31, 2015 consisted of senior secured loans fair valued at $306.6 million and related indebtedness of $194.8 million. As of that date, the loans held by the 2013-2 CLO (held at fair value), together with cash and other assets held by the 2013-2 CLO, equaled approximately $323.5 million. As of December 31, 2015, our portfolio had an average investment size of approximately $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.8% and a weighted average contractual maturity of 44 months.\nExpenses related to, but not limited to, ratings expenses, due diligence, valuation expenses and independent collateral appraisals may arise when we make certain investments. These expenses, as well as insurance expenses and trustee expenses are recognized as incurred in the consolidated statements of operations within other expenses.\n\n \u2022 The valuation committee of the board of directors reviews these preliminary valuations. \nThe types of factors that the board of directors may take into account when reviewing the fair value initially derived by the Investment Adviser and determining the fair value of our consumer loan investments generally include, as appropriate, prepayment and default rates derived from historical performance, actual performance as compared to historical projections and discount rates.\n \u2022 changes in political, economic or industry conditions, the interest rate environment or conditions affecting the financial and capital markets, which could result in changes to the value of our assets; \nThe Administrator also manages the determination and publication of our net asset value, the preparation and filing of our tax returns and generally monitors the payment of our expenses and the performance of administrative and professional services rendered to us by others. The Administrator may retain third parties to assist in providing administrative services to us. To the extent that the Administrator outsources any of its functions, we pay the fees associated with such functions on a direct basis without any profit to the Administrator.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,758,779, the net increase in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $1.82.\nPortfolio Activity\n \u2022 all other expenses reasonably incurred by us or the Administrator in connection with administering our business, including rent and our allocable portion of the costs and expenses of our chief compliance officer, chief financial officer and their respective staffs. \n 63 \n \u2022 the impact of future acquisitions and divestitures. \nAs of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had cash of $10.4 million and $25.0 million, respectively. Also, as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 we had restricted cash of $12.6 million and $11.8 million, respectively.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, we realized a net loss on investments of $(11.7) million. Net realized losses for the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily driven by $(8.5) million of realized losses incurred from the significant restructurings of two portfolio investments, a realized loss of $(4.4) million from the early full repayment of one portfolio investment, and $(2.8) million of realized losses in GLC Trust 2013-2's consumer loan portfolio. This was offset by a $2.5 million realized gain incurred from the partial sale of one portfolio investment and net realized gains of $1.5 million incurred from the early full repayment of 17 portfolio investments, the sale of one portfolio investment and other partial repayments.\n 60 \nDividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex-dividend date. The amount to be paid out as a distribution is determined by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon the earnings estimated by management. Net realized capital gains, if any, are distributed at least annually, although we may decide to retain such capital gains for investment.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have certain contracts under which we have material future commitments. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement, the Investment Adviser provides us with investment advisory and management services. We have agreed to pay for these services (1) a base management fee equal to a percentage of the average adjusted value of our gross assets and (2) an incentive fee based on our performance.\n \u2022 independent director fees and expenses; \nThe decrease in interest income was largely driven by our non-performing assets and lower investment balances during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in other income was primarily driven by lower prepayment and amendment fees recognized during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nOur board of directors has retained several independent valuation firms to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation at least once during each 12-month period. To the extent a security is reviewed in a particular quarter, it is reviewed and valued by only one service provider. However, our board of directors does not intend to have de minimis investments of less than 0.5% of our total assets (up to an aggregate of 10% of our total assets) independently reviewed. Our board of directors is responsible for determining the fair value of our assets in good faith using a documented valuation policy and consistently applied valuation process.\nNet assets could be materially affected if the determinations regarding the fair value of the investments were materially higher or lower than the values that are ultimately realized upon the disposal of such investments.\nBased on basic weighted average shares outstanding of 16,742,531, the net decrease in net assets from operations per share for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $(0.22).\n 61 \nWe have adopted a dividend reinvestment plan that provides for reinvestment of our dividends and other distributions on behalf of our stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash as provided below. As a result, if our board of directors declares a cash dividend or other distribution, then our stockholders who have not \u2018opted out' of our dividend reinvestment plan will have their cash distribution automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock, rather than receiving the cash distribution.\nNet (Decrease) / Increase in Net Assets from Operations", "item_7_tables":

As of December 31, 2016, the company held investments in 58 portfolio companies with a fair value of $376.7 million. The portfolio had an average investment size of $6.2 million, a weighted average yield on debt investments of 10.9%, and a weighted average maturity of 37 months.\n\n2. For 2016, the company had $43.0 million in total investment income, $23.9 million in total expenses, and $19.1 million in net investment income. This was a decrease from 2015, mainly driven by lower interest income.\n\n3. Net realized losses on investments in 2016 were $30.6 million, primarily driven by losses on several specific investments. Net unrealized gains were $6.7 million, mainly due to reversals of prior unrealized losses.  \n\n4. The net decrease in net assets from operations was $4.8 million in 2016 compared to $3.7 million in 2015. On a per share basis, the net decrease was $0.31 in 2016 versus $0.22 in 2015.\n\n5. As of December 31, 2016, the company had $25.0 million available for additional borrowings and $4.8 million of unfunded commitments to portfolio companies.\n\nIn summary, investment income decreased in 2016 but net asset value remained relatively steady. The company realized some losses but saw offsets from unrealized gains on prior investments. Liquidity remains available for additional investments in portfolio companies."}
