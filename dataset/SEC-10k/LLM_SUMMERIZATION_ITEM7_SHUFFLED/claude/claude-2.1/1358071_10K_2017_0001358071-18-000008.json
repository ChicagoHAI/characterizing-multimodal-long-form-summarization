Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report.\nCertain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further details about these statements.\nOverview\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Concho's legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends. We are actively developing our resource base by utilizing extended length lateral drilling, enhanced completion techniques, multi-well pad locations and large-scale development projects throughout our four core operating areas: the Northern Delaware Basin, the Southern Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin and the New Mexico Shelf. Oil comprised 60 percent of our 840 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 and 62 percent of our 70 MMBoe of production for 2017. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 92 percent of our proved developed producing reserves and 79 percent of our 8,152 gross wells at December 31, 2017. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used.\nFinancial and Operating Performance\nOur financial and operating performance for 2017 included the following highlights:\n\u00b7 Net income was $956 million ($6.41 per diluted share) as compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion ($(10.85) per diluted share) in 2016. The increase was primarily due to:\n\u2022 no recorded impairments of long-lived assets in 2017, as compared to $1.5 billion in non-cash impairment charges in 2016 primarily attributable to properties in our New Mexico Shelf area;\n\u2022 $951 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues as a result of a 28 percent increase in production and a 24 percent increase in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities);\n\u2022 $560 million increase in gain on disposition of assets, net due to a gain of approximately $678 million during 2017 primarily attributable to our disposition of ACC, as compared to a gain of approximately $118 million during 2016 primarily attributable to our Northern Delaware Basin divestiture in February 2016;\n\u2022 $243 million decrease in the loss on derivatives; and\n\u2022 $21 million decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to a decrease in the depletion rate per Boe, partially offset by an increase in production;\npartially offset by:\n\u2022 $801 million change in our income tax provision primarily due to favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA, resulting in a provisional discrete income tax benefit of approximately $398 million. This benefit more than offset the $308 million income tax expense on income before taxes during 2017 at the federal statutory rate;\n\u2022 $88 million increase in production expense, primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017 and (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017; and\n\u2022 $68 million increase in production and ad valorem tax expense, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased oil and natural gas sales.\n\u00b7 Average daily sales volumes increased by 28 percent from 150,511 Boe per day during 2016 to 192,658 Boe per day during 2017.\n\u00b7 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $311 million to $1,695 million for 2017, as compared to $1,384 million in 2016, primarily due to increased oil and natural gas revenues and decreased cash interest expense, partially offset by (i) decreased cash settlements on derivatives, (ii) increased production expense and (iii) increased production tax expense.\n\u00b7 Cash decreased by approximately $53 million during 2017 primarily as a result of cash paid to tender and extinguish the 5.5% Notes and cash paid for the Midland Basin and Northern Delaware Basin acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes and proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC.\nCommodity Prices\nOur results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a description of the factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\nAlthough we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Notes 8 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2017 and additional derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2017, respectively.\nOil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. The average oil and natural gas prices were higher during 2017 compared to 2016. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the high and low NYMEX prices for the same periods:\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average NYMEX prices:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil (Bbl)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.97\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.84\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Natural gas (MMBtu)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.63\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> High and Low NYMEX prices:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil (Bbl):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 60.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 54.06\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61.43\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 42.53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 26.21\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34.73\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Natural gas (MMBtu):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> High\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.72\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.23\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Low\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.64\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.76\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFurther, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $66.14 and $59.19 per Bbl and $3.63 and $2.55 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2018 to February 16, 2018. At February 16, 2018, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $61.68 per Bbl and $2.56 per MMBtu, respectively.\nHistorically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nPotential cost inflation. Oilfield service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. As companies have expanded their drilling and development activities during 2017, the demand for third-party oilfield services and suppliers has also increased. As such, if the commodity price environment continues to trend upward, we expect demand for oilfield services and supplies to continue to grow, and the costs of drilling, equipping and operating our wells and infrastructure could begin to rise.\nRecent Events\n2018 capital budget. In February 2018, we announced our 2018 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $2.0 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Approximately 93 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2018 capital program is expected to continue focusing on large-scale project development. Our 2018 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. Our budget could change depending on numerous factors, including commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions.\nTax reform. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States ( the President\u201d) signed into law the TCJA, significantly changing corporate income tax laws. According to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) section 740, Income Taxes,\u201d a company is required to record the effects of an enacted tax law or rate change in income from continuing operations in the period of enactment, which is the date the bill is signed by the President and becomes law. We note that certain aspects of these changes will impact our future after-tax earnings primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d ( SAB 118\u201d) to provide guidance for companies that have not completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment. SAB 118 allows companies to report provisional amounts when based on reasonable estimates and to adjust these amounts during a measurement period of up to one year.\nAlthough we have performed an initial assessment of the TCJA, we recognize that it is a comprehensive bill and the ultimate impacts may differ from our initial estimates due to changes in our interpretations as a result of additional regulatory guidance that may become available. As such, we have elected to apply SAB 118 and have recorded, based on reasonable estimates, provisional amounts of our income tax balances reported in our financial statements. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our income tax balances.\nAs we continue to refine our analysis of the tax law changes and monitor new tax law interpretation, any adjustments to our provisional amounts identified during the measurement period will be included as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the period these amounts are determined.\nSouthern Delaware Basin divestitures. In January 2018, we closed on two asset sales transactions of certain non-core assets in Reeves and Ward Counties with combined preliminary proceeds of approximately $280 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, we received cash deposits totaling approximately $29 million for the asset sales, which was included in the total cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding these divestitures.\nFebruary 2018 nonmonetary transaction. In February 2018, we closed on a strategic trade where we received approximately 21,000 net acres, primarily located in the Midland Basin, with current production of 5 MBoepd in exchange for 34,000 net acres, primarily comprised of approximately 32,000 net acres in the northern Delaware Basin, with current production of 3 MBoepd.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nDerivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net liability of $379 million. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls\u201d on our financial derivative instruments. The terms of our credit facility do not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. In September 2017, we elected to enter into an Investment Grade Period\u201d under our credit facility, which had the effect of releasing all collateral formerly securing the credit facility and derivative obligations. See Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nNew commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2017, we entered into the following oil price swaps, oil basis swaps and natural gas price swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production:\nTable 30: <table>

Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $2,586 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $951 million (58 percent) from $1,635 million for 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in realized oil and natural gas production as well as the increase in oil and natural gas prices (excluding the effects of derivative activities). Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following:\n\u00b7 total oil production was 43,472 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 9,632 MBbl (28 percent) from 33,840 MBbl for 2016;\n\u00b7 average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $48.13 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21 percent from $39.90 per Bbl during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(2.84) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 94 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2016. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.30 per Bbl and $0.15 per Bbl, respectively. Additionally, we incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. These fixed deductions were less per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to more production transported through pipelines and successful renegotiation of fixed deductions for trucked volumes;\n\u00b7 total natural gas production was 161,089 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 33,608 MMcf (26 percent) from 127,481 MMcf for 2016; and\n\u00b7 average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $3.07 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 38 percent from $2.23 per Mcf during 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we realized approximately 102 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. The increase in our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nOil and natural gas production expenses.

The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017, (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017, particularly our Reliance Acquisition and our Midland Basin acquisition, whose associated properties incur higher lease operating expense per Boe than our legacy assets and (iii) increased cost of services.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes.

Over the same period, our revenue per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 24 percent. The increase in production taxes per unit of production was directly related to the increase in oil and natural gas sales, partially offset by a $5 million tax credit received during 2017 related to certain wells in Texas qualifying for reduced severance tax rates, as compared to $4 million in tax credit received during 2016. Production taxes fluctuate with the market value of our production sold, while ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and natural gas properties at the beginning of the year, which vary across the different areas in which we operate.\nExploration and abandonments expense.

We did not recognize any exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded approximately $29 million and $60 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) acreage expiring in our Southern Delaware Basin core area and (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas in locations where we have no future plans to drill. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas that, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin areas.\nOur other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense.

The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) lower drilling and completion costs per Boe of proved developed reserves added, (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition as well as other acquisitions, and higher commodity prices, partially offset by decreased proved reserves caused by reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (iii) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016.\nImpairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nWe estimate undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management's assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2017, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2018 price of $59.55 per barrel of oil decreasing to a 2024 price of $51.82 per barrel of oil marginally recovering to a 2025 price of $51.83 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2018 price of $2.84 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2019 price of $2.81 per Mcf then rising to a 2025 price of $2.99 per Mcf of natural gas. Both oil and natural gas commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2025.\nWe estimate fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2023. We did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIt is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets.\nWe estimate that if the future oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis, and noted above, would have been approximately 10 percent lower at December 31, 2017 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve performance curves, no impairment would be indicated. Other assumptions such as operating costs, well and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes, and operating and development plans would likely change given a change in oil and natural gas prices. However, we did not estimate the correlation between these assumptions and any estimated commodity price change, and these and other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the effects of a reduction in commodity prices, including the ultimate impact and amount of any potential impairment charge. As a result, we are unable to predict with certainty whether or not a decline in commodity prices alone will or will not cause us to recognize an impairment charge in a particular field or the magnitude of any such impairment charge. We additionally note that there may be changes to both drilling and completion designs that affect the volume curves, capital costs estimates, and the amount of proved undeveloped locations that can be recorded, each of which will affect management's estimates of future cash flows.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.

The increase in cash general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased compensation expense. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to increased production, partially offset by the increase in cash general and administrative costs noted above.\nWe receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of approximately $16 million and $17 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nGain (loss) on derivatives.

We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This amount includes: (i) approximately $36 million associated with the premium paid for the Tender Offer, approximately $25 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 5.5% Notes, approximately $21 million of unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $2 million of additional interest on the 5.5% Notes to October 13, 2017, which was paid in September 2017, reduced by approximately $19 million of unamortized premium; and (ii) approximately $1 million representing the proportional amount of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with banks that are no longer in the credit facility syndicate as a result of the April 2017 credit facility amendment.\nWe recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes: (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs.\nIncome tax provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $75 million, which includes discrete provisional income tax benefits of approximately $398 million related to the enactment of the TCJA and $6 million related to stock-based awards recorded in the income tax provision pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09 adopted on January 1, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $876 million primarily due to having a loss before income taxes.\nThe change in our income tax provision in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA in December 2017 as the income tax benefit related to the federal statutory rate change more than offset our income tax expense of $308 million on income before income taxes during 2017. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (9) percent and 38 percent, respectively. The 2017 rate was negative due to recognizing an overall income tax benefit while having pre-tax income.\nAs we continue to implement and address the ongoing impacts of the TCJA, we may determine it necessary in the future to adjust our income tax calculations due to changes in our initial interpretations or assumptions. As we have elected to apply\nSAB 118, adjustments to provisional amounts included in the total income tax benefit are allowable during the one-year measurement period. We will continue to monitor new tax law interpretations.\nWe evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In February 2017, we sold our ownership interest in ACC, which consisted of property in both Texas and New Mexico, and in April 2017, we completed an acquisition of assets in the Northern Delaware Basin. We have considered these and other factors and did not identify a shift in our projected future apportionment between New Mexico and Texas for the year ended December 31, 2017. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\nOil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,635 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $169 million (9 percent) from $1,804 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in natural gas production. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following:\n\u00b7 total oil production was 33,840 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 617 MBbl (2 percent) from 34,457 MBbl for 2015;\n\u00b7 average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $39.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 11 percent from $44.69 per Bbl during 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(4.15) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2015. We incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. Additionally, the basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.15 per Bbl and $0.41 per Bbl, respectively;\n\u00b7 total natural gas production was 127,481 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 20,494 MMcf (19 percent) from 106,987 MMcf for 2015; and\n\u00b7 average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $2.23 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 9 percent from $2.46 per Mcf during 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we realized approximately 87 percent and 94 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Factors contributing to the decrease in our realized gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 were (i) a decrease in the posted regional natural gas prices on which we are paid while the NYMEX natural gas price decreased at a lesser rate and (ii) increased deductions and fees from the regional natural gas price, comparatively. Over the past three years, approximately half of our total natural gas revenues have been derived from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $18.08 per Bbl and $17.80 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOil and natural gas production expenses.

The decrease in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) implementation of operational cost efficiencies and (ii) an overall decrease in the cost of goods and services. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in lease operating expenses noted above coupled with a slight increase in production.\nWorkover expenses were approximately $19 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to less overall activity during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes.

Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to (i) an uneconomic well in our Southern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish production in an unconventional zone for the area and (ii) expensing an unsuccessful well, which we did not operate, that was located in our New Mexico Shelf core area.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $50 million primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas which, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin core areas.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $25 million primarily related to expired and abandoned acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin core area where we currently have no intent to drill.\nOur other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense.

The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition and reductions in future estimated lease operating expenses, partially offset by decreased proved\nreserves caused by (i) reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (ii) lower commodity prices.\nThe increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with additional other property and equipment related to buildings and other items.\nImpairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nWe calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management's assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2016, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2017 price of $56.19 per barrel of oil to a 2024 price of $57.41 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2017 price of $3.61 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2020 price of $2.88 per Mcf of natural gas partially recovering to a 2024 price of $3.38 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2024.\nWe calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2022 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2022.\nWe recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the carrying amount of certain of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets being less than their expected undiscounted future net cash flows, which was primarily attributable to properties in our eastern Midland Basin area.\nIt is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. If the oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis would have been approximately 10 percent lower as of December 31, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve volumes, no impairment would be indicated.\nGeneral and administrative expenses.

The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in forfeiture estimates. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in non-cash stock-based compensation costs noted above coupled with a slight increase in production.\nWe receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of $17 million and $19 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in reimbursements was primarily due to decreased drilling and completion activity during 2016 and a higher average working interest in our wells drilled in 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nGain (loss) on derivatives.

To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.\nGain (loss) on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $118 million and a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $54 million, respectively. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million. In December 2015, we completed an acreage exchange with Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. that consolidated acres into a concentrated, operated position in our Southern Delaware Basin core area. We recognized a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $50 million related to the acreage exchange.\nInterest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate - credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate - senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average credit facility balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average senior notes balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,350\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total weighted average debt balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,182\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,545\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in the weighted average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the repayment of our credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from our October 2015 equity offering and, to a lesser extent, the early redemption of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.0% Notes. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance, partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs.\nIncome tax provisions. We recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $876 million and income tax expense of approximately $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The shift in our income tax provision is primarily due to a significant pre-tax book loss in 2016 as compared to pre-tax book income in 2015. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38 percent and 32 percent, respectively.\nWe evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million and approximately $9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCapital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity\nCapital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in - Capital resources\u201d below.\nOil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to our increased drilling and completion activity level during 2017 as compared to 2016. Our intent is to manage our capital spending to be within our cash flow, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in costs incurred and cash flow expenditures was our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition and timing of payments. Total 2017 expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC and (iii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition.\n2018 capital budget. In February 2018, we announced our 2018 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $2.0 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our 2018 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows.\nOther than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise.\nAcquisitions. The following table reflects our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Property acquisition costs:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Proved\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Unproved\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total property acquisition costs (a)\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,208\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Included in the property acquisition costs above are budgeted unproved leasehold acreage acquisitions of approximately $52 million, $30 million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information regarding future interest payment obligations on our long-term debt. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only.\n(b) Cash interest expense on our senior notes is estimated assuming no principal repayment until their maturity dates. Also included in the Less than 1 year\u201d column is accrued interest at December 31, 2017 of approximately $36 million. During 2017, we decreased our annual interest expense and extended our average maturity from six to 16 years by issuing the 2017 Notes and completing the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes. At December 31, 2017, we had variable-rate debt outstanding under our credit facility of $322 million.\n(c) Derivative obligations represent commodity derivatives that were valued at December 31, 2017. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See", "item_7_truncated": "During the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2023. We did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCapital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in - Capital resources\u201d below.\n\u2022 $21 million decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to a decrease in the depletion rate per Boe, partially offset by an increase in production;\nWe estimate that if the future oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis, and noted above, would have been approximately 10 percent lower at December 31, 2017 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve performance curves, no impairment would be indicated. Other assumptions such as operating costs, well and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes, and operating and development plans would likely change given a change in oil and natural gas prices. However, we did not estimate the correlation between these assumptions and any estimated commodity price change, and these and other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the effects of a reduction in commodity prices, including the ultimate impact and amount of any potential impairment charge. As a result, we are unable to predict with certainty whether or not a decline in commodity prices alone will or will not cause us to recognize an impairment charge in a particular field or the magnitude of any such impairment charge. We additionally note that there may be changes to both drilling and completion designs that affect the volume curves, capital costs estimates, and the amount of proved undeveloped locations that can be recorded, each of which will affect management's estimates of future cash flows.\nTable 34: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Per\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Per\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions, except per unit amounts)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Boe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Boe\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Production taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.58\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.13\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ad valorem taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.25\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total production and ad valorem taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.82\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.38\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIt is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. If the oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis would have been approximately 10 percent lower as of December 31, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve volumes, no impairment would be indicated.\n\n\nOur exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. We did not recognize any exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to our increased drilling and completion activity level during 2017 as compared to 2016. Our intent is to manage our capital spending to be within our cash flow, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in costs incurred and cash flow expenditures was our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition and timing of payments. Total 2017 expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC and (iii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition.\nOil and natural gas production expenses.

which was an increase of $86 million (29 percent) from $301 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017, (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017, particularly our Reliance Acquisition and our Midland Basin acquisition, whose associated properties incur higher lease operating expense per Boe than our legacy assets and (iii) increased cost of services.\nWe receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of $17 million and $19 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in reimbursements was primarily due to decreased drilling and completion activity during 2016 and a higher average working interest in our wells drilled in 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nAmong the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices.\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Geological and geophysical\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Exploratory dry hole costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Leasehold abandonments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total exploration and abandonments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n\u2022 $88 million increase in production expense, primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017 and (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017; and\nTable 39: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, as reported\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Interest expense, excluding impact of capitalized interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate - credit facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate - senior notes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average credit facility balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average senior notes balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,182\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Total weighted average debt balance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,182\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant.

the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from the Reliance Acquisition for periods prior to October 2016. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities, fluctuations in commodity prices and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results.\nWe evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In February 2017, we sold our ownership interest in ACC, which consisted of property in both Texas and New Mexico, and in April 2017, we completed an acquisition of assets in the Northern Delaware Basin. We have considered these and other factors and did not identify a shift in our projected future apportionment between New Mexico and Texas for the year ended December 31, 2017. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States ( the President\u201d) signed into law the TCJA, significantly changing corporate income tax laws. According to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) section 740, Income Taxes,\u201d a company is required to record the effects of an enacted tax law or rate change in income from continuing operations in the period of enactment, which is the date the bill is signed by the President and becomes law. We note that certain aspects of these changes will impact our future after-tax earnings primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d ( SAB 118\u201d) to provide guidance for companies that have not completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment. SAB 118 allows companies to report provisional amounts when based on reasonable estimates and to adjust these amounts during a measurement period of up to one year.\n\nSAB 118, adjustments to provisional amounts included in the total income tax benefit are allowable during the one-year measurement period. We will continue to monitor new tax law interpretations.\n\u00b7 average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $3.07 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 38 percent from $2.23 per Mcf during 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we realized approximately 102 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. The increase in our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nImpairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes.

Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,635 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $169 million (9 percent) from $1,804 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in natural gas production. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following:\nTable 38: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on derivatives:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (172)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (337)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Natural gas derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (32)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (126)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (369)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The following table represents our net cash receipts from derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Years Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash receipts from derivatives:\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Oil derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Natural gas derivatives\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and administrative expenses.

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $118 million and a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $54 million, respectively. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million. In December 2015, we completed an acreage exchange with Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. that consolidated acres into a concentrated, operated position in our Southern Delaware Basin core area. We recognized a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $50 million related to the acreage exchange.\n\u2022 $68 million increase in production and ad valorem tax expense, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased oil and natural gas sales.\n\nOur financial and operating performance for 2017 included the following highlights:\n\u00b7 average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $39.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 11 percent from $44.69 per Bbl during 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(4.15) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2015. We incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. Additionally, the basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.15 per Bbl and $0.41 per Bbl, respectively;\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. The following table provides the components of our production and ad valorem tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nOur weighted average debt balance decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to (i) the satisfaction and discharge of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, (ii) the redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and (iii) the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes in September 2017, partially offset by (i) the issuance of the 4.375% Notes in December 2016, (ii) the issuance of the 2017 Notes in September 2017 and (iii) an increase in borrowings under our credit facility. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance and an increase in capitalized interest.\n\u00b7 Cash decreased by approximately $53 million during 2017 primarily as a result of cash paid to tender and extinguish the 5.5% Notes and cash paid for the Midland Basin and Northern Delaware Basin acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes and proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $226 million ($4.09 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $5 million (2 percent) from $231 million ($4.42 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in forfeiture estimates. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in non-cash stock-based compensation costs noted above coupled with a slight increase in production.\nWe recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes: (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs.\n\u00b7 Net income was $956 million ($6.41 per diluted share) as compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion ($(10.85) per diluted share) in 2016. The increase was primarily due to:\nAcquisitions. The following table reflects our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nWe evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million and approximately $9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\n\u00b7 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $311 million to $1,695 million for 2017, as compared to $1,384 million in 2016, primarily due to increased oil and natural gas revenues and decreased cash interest expense, partially offset by (i) decreased cash settlements on derivatives, (ii) increased production expense and (iii) increased production tax expense.\nWe estimate undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management's assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2017, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2018 price of $59.55 per barrel of oil decreasing to a 2024 price of $51.82 per barrel of oil marginally recovering to a 2025 price of $51.83 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2018 price of $2.84 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2019 price of $2.81 per Mcf then rising to a 2025 price of $2.99 per Mcf of natural gas. Both oil and natural gas commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2025.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $25 million primarily related to expired and abandoned acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin core area where we currently have no intent to drill.\nAs we continue to implement and address the ongoing impacts of the TCJA, we may determine it necessary in the future to adjust our income tax calculations due to changes in our initial interpretations or assumptions. As we have elected to apply\nOur other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals.\n\nreserves caused by (i) reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (ii) lower commodity prices.\nWe recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the carrying amount of certain of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets being less than their expected undiscounted future net cash flows, which was primarily attributable to properties in our eastern Midland Basin area.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nAlthough we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Notes 8 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2017 and additional derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2017, respectively.\nThe decrease in the weighted average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the repayment of our credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from our October 2015 equity offering and, to a lesser extent, the early redemption of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.0% Notes. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance, partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest.\n\u00b7 total natural gas production was 161,089 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 33,608 MMcf (26 percent) from 127,481 MMcf for 2016; and\n\nOur earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome tax provisions. We recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $876 million and income tax expense of approximately $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The shift in our income tax provision is primarily due to a significant pre-tax book loss in 2016 as compared to pre-tax book income in 2015. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38 percent and 32 percent, respectively.\n\nInterest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nProduction taxes per unit of production were $2.58 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21 percent from $2.13 per Boe during 2016. Over the same period, our revenue per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 24 percent. The increase in production taxes per unit of production was directly related to the increase in oil and natural gas sales, partially offset by a $5 million tax credit received during 2017 related to certain wells in Texas qualifying for reduced severance tax rates, as compared to $4 million in tax credit received during 2016. Production taxes fluctuate with the market value of our production sold, while ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and natural gas properties at the beginning of the year, which vary across the different areas in which we operate.\nExploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nThe following table presents selected production data for the fields which represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n\u2022 $243 million decrease in the loss on derivatives; and\nGain on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $678 million and $118 million, respectively. In February 2017, we closed on the\nOur geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis.\nDerivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net liability of $379 million. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls\u201d on our financial derivative instruments. The terms of our credit facility do not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. In September 2017, we elected to enter into an Investment Grade Period\u201d under our credit facility, which had the effect of releasing all collateral formerly securing the credit facility and derivative obligations. See Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $244 million ($3.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $18 million (8 percent) from $226 million ($4.09 per Boe) for 2016. The increase in cash general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased compensation expense. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to increased production, partially offset by the increase in cash general and administrative costs noted above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\u2022 $560 million increase in gain on disposition of assets, net due to a gain of approximately $678 million during 2017 primarily attributable to our disposition of ACC, as compared to a gain of approximately $118 million during 2016 primarily attributable to our Northern Delaware Basin divestiture in February 2016;\n(b) Cash interest expense on our senior notes is estimated assuming no principal repayment until their maturity dates. Also included in the Less than 1 year\u201d column is accrued interest at December 31, 2017 of approximately $36 million. During 2017, we decreased our annual interest expense and extended our average maturity from six to 16 years by issuing the 2017 Notes and completing the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes. At December 31, 2017, we had variable-rate debt outstanding under our credit facility of $322 million.\n\u00b7 total oil production was 43,472 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 9,632 MBbl (28 percent) from 33,840 MBbl for 2016;\nOther than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise.\n\nCertain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further details about these statements.\n\u00b7 total oil production was 33,840 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 617 MBbl (2 percent) from 34,457 MBbl for 2015;\n\u2022 $801 million change in our income tax provision primarily due to favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA, resulting in a provisional discrete income tax benefit of approximately $398 million. This benefit more than offset the $308 million income tax expense on income before taxes during 2017 at the federal statutory rate;\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded approximately $29 million and $60 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) acreage expiring in our Southern Delaware Basin core area and (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas in locations where we have no future plans to drill. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas that, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin areas.\nWe estimate fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value.\npartially offset by:\nFinancial and Operating Performance\nHistorically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\u00b7 average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $48.13 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21 percent from $39.90 per Bbl during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(2.84) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 94 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2016. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.30 per Bbl and $0.15 per Bbl, respectively. Additionally, we incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. These fixed deductions were less per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to more production transported through pipelines and successful renegotiation of fixed deductions for trucked volumes;\nOur results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a description of the factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\n\u2022 no recorded impairments of long-lived assets in 2017, as compared to $1.5 billion in non-cash impairment charges in 2016 primarily attributable to properties in our New Mexico Shelf area;\nImpairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAlthough we have performed an initial assessment of the TCJA, we recognize that it is a comprehensive bill and the ultimate impacts may differ from our initial estimates due to changes in our interpretations as a result of additional regulatory guidance that may become available. As such, we have elected to apply SAB 118 and have recorded, based on reasonable estimates, provisional amounts of our income tax balances reported in our financial statements. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our income tax balances.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2022 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2022.\n\nExploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n(c) Derivative obligations represent commodity derivatives that were valued at December 31, 2017. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See\n\u00b7 total natural gas production was 127,481 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 20,494 MMcf (19 percent) from 106,987 MMcf for 2015; and\nOur exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to (i) an uneconomic well in our Southern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish production in an unconventional zone for the area and (ii) expensing an unsuccessful well, which we did not operate, that was located in our New Mexico Shelf core area.\nInterest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nContractual obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:\nThe change in our income tax provision in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA in December 2017 as the income tax benefit related to the federal statutory rate change more than offset our income tax expense of $308 million on income before income taxes during 2017. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (9) percent and 38 percent, respectively. The 2017 rate was negative due to recognizing an overall income tax benefit while having pre-tax income.\nWe receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of approximately $16 million and $17 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome tax provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $75 million, which includes discrete provisional income tax benefits of approximately $398 million related to the enactment of the TCJA and $6 million related to stock-based awards recorded in the income tax provision pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09 adopted on January 1, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $876 million primarily due to having a loss before income taxes.\nDepletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,122 million ($15.95 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $23 million (2 percent) from $1,145 million ($20.79 per Boe) for 2016. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) lower drilling and completion costs per Boe of proved developed reserves added, (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition as well as other acquisitions, and higher commodity prices, partially offset by decreased proved reserves caused by reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (iii) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016.\nProduction taxes per unit of production were $2.13 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 13 percent from $2.46 per Boe during 2015. The decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices. Over the same period, our average realized prices per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 14 percent.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $50 million primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas which, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin core areas.\n\u00b7 average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $2.23 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 9 percent from $2.46 per Mcf during 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we realized approximately 87 percent and 94 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Factors contributing to the decrease in our realized gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 were (i) a decrease in the posted regional natural gas prices on which we are paid while the NYMEX natural gas price decreased at a lesser rate and (ii) increased deductions and fees from the regional natural gas price, comparatively. Over the past three years, approximately half of our total natural gas revenues have been derived from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $18.08 per Bbl and $17.80 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOverview\nLease operating expenses were $301 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of $61 million (17 percent) from $362 million ($6.93 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) implementation of operational cost efficiencies and (ii) an overall decrease in the cost of goods and services. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in lease operating expenses noted above coupled with a slight increase in production.\nWorkover expenses were approximately $19 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to less overall activity during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nDepletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,145 million ($20.79 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $58 million (5 percent) from $1,203 million ($23.02 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition and reductions in future estimated lease operating expenses, partially offset by decreased proved\nGain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nWe calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management's assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2016, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2017 price of $56.19 per barrel of oil to a 2024 price of $57.41 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2017 price of $3.61 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2020 price of $2.88 per Mcf of natural gas partially recovering to a 2024 price of $3.38 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2024.\nWe calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report.\nFurther, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $66.14 and $59.19 per Bbl and $3.63 and $2.55 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2018 to February 16, 2018. At February 16, 2018, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $61.68 per Bbl and $2.56 per MMBtu, respectively.\n\nPotential cost inflation. Oilfield service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. As companies have expanded their drilling and development activities during 2017, the demand for third-party oilfield services and suppliers has also increased. As such, if the commodity price environment continues to trend upward, we expect demand for oilfield services and supplies to continue to grow, and the costs of drilling, equipping and operating our wells and infrastructure could begin to rise.\n(a) See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information regarding future interest payment obligations on our long-term debt. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only.\nSouthern Delaware Basin divestitures. In January 2018, we closed on two asset sales transactions of certain non-core assets in Reeves and Ward Counties with combined preliminary proceeds of approximately $280 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, we received cash deposits totaling approximately $29 million for the asset sales, which was included in the total cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding these divestitures.\ndivestiture of our ownership interest in ACC. After adjustments for debt and working capital, we received cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $801 million. After direct transaction costs, we recorded a pre-tax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $655 million. Our net investment in ACC at the time of closing was approximately $129 million. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million.\nNew commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2017, we entered into the following oil price swaps, oil basis swaps and natural gas price swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production:\nOil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. The average oil and natural gas prices were higher during 2017 compared to 2016. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the high and low NYMEX prices for the same periods:\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Concho's legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends. We are actively developing our resource base by utilizing extended length lateral drilling, enhanced completion techniques, multi-well pad locations and large-scale development projects throughout our four core operating areas: the Northern Delaware Basin, the Southern Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin and the New Mexico Shelf. Oil comprised 60 percent of our 840 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 and 62 percent of our 70 MMBoe of production for 2017. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 92 percent of our proved developed producing reserves and 79 percent of our 8,152 gross wells at December 31, 2017. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used.", "item_7_text": "During the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2023 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2023. We did not recognize an impairment charge during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nCapital commitments. Our primary needs for cash are development, exploration and acquisition of oil and natural gas assets, payment of contractual obligations and working capital obligations. Funding for these cash needs may be provided by any combination of internally-generated cash flow, financing under our credit facility, proceeds from the disposition of assets or alternative financing sources, as discussed in - Capital resources\u201d below.\n\u2022 $21 million decrease in depreciation, depletion and amortization expense, primarily due to a decrease in the depletion rate per Boe, partially offset by an increase in production;\nWe estimate that if the future oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis, and noted above, would have been approximately 10 percent lower at December 31, 2017 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve performance curves, no impairment would be indicated. Other assumptions such as operating costs, well and reservoir performance, severance and ad valorem taxes, and operating and development plans would likely change given a change in oil and natural gas prices. However, we did not estimate the correlation between these assumptions and any estimated commodity price change, and these and other assumptions may worsen or partially mitigate some of the effects of a reduction in commodity prices, including the ultimate impact and amount of any potential impairment charge. As a result, we are unable to predict with certainty whether or not a decline in commodity prices alone will or will not cause us to recognize an impairment charge in a particular field or the magnitude of any such impairment charge. We additionally note that there may be changes to both drilling and completion designs that affect the volume curves, capital costs estimates, and the amount of proved undeveloped locations that can be recorded, each of which will affect management's estimates of future cash flows.\nIt is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. If the oil and natural gas prices used in this analysis would have been approximately 10 percent lower as of December 31, 2016 with no other changes in capital costs, operating costs, price differentials, or reserve volumes, no impairment would be indicated.\n\n\nOur exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. We did not recognize any exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2017.\nOil and natural gas properties. Our costs incurred on oil and natural gas properties, excluding acquisitions, during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled $1.7 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. The increase from 2016 to 2017 was primarily due to our increased drilling and completion activity level during 2017 as compared to 2016. Our intent is to manage our capital spending to be within our cash flow, excluding unbudgeted acquisitions. The primary reason for the differences in costs incurred and cash flow expenditures was our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition and timing of payments. Total 2017 expenditures were primarily funded in part from (i) cash flows from operations, (ii) proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC and (iii) our issuance of approximately 2.2 million shares of common stock related to our Northern Delaware Basin acquisition.\nOil and natural gas production expenses. The following table provides the components of our oil and natural gas production expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n2018 capital budget. In February 2018, we announced our 2018 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $2.0 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Our 2018 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows.\nIt is reasonably possible that the estimate of undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets may change in the future resulting in the need to impair carrying values. The primary factors that may affect estimates of future net cash flows are (i) commodity futures prices, (ii) increases or decreases in production and capital costs, (iii) future reserve volume adjustments, both positive and negative, to proved reserves and appropriate risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (iv) results of future drilling activities and (v) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets.\nFebruary 2018 nonmonetary transaction. In February 2018, we closed on a strategic trade where we received approximately 21,000 net acres, primarily located in the Midland Basin, with current production of 5 MBoepd in exchange for 34,000 net acres, primarily comprised of approximately 32,000 net acres in the northern Delaware Basin, with current production of 3 MBoepd.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n2018 capital budget. In February 2018, we announced our 2018 capital budget, excluding acquisitions, of approximately $2.0 billion with expected capital spending to range between $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. Approximately 93 percent of capital will be directed to drilling and completion activity. Our 2018 capital program is expected to continue focusing on large-scale project development. Our 2018 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be within our cash flows. Our budget could change depending on numerous factors, including commodity prices, leverage metrics and industry conditions.\n\nAs we continue to refine our analysis of the tax law changes and monitor new tax law interpretation, any adjustments to our provisional amounts identified during the measurement period will be included as an adjustment to tax expense or benefit from continuing operations in the period these amounts are determined.\n\nResults of Operations\nRecent Events\nLease operating expenses were $387 million ($5.50 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, which was an increase of $86 million (29 percent) from $301 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017, (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017, particularly our Reliance Acquisition and our Midland Basin acquisition, whose associated properties incur higher lease operating expense per Boe than our legacy assets and (iii) increased cost of services.\nWe receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of $17 million and $19 million during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in reimbursements was primarily due to decreased drilling and completion activity during 2016 and a higher average working interest in our wells drilled in 2016 as compared to 2015, partially offset by increased reimbursements attributable to more wells operated in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nAmong the cost components of production expenses, we have some control over lease operating expenses and workover costs on properties we operate, but production and ad valorem taxes are related to commodity prices.\n\u2022 $88 million increase in production expense, primarily due to (i) increased production associated with our wells successfully drilled and completed in 2016 and 2017 and (ii) our acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2016 and during 2017; and\nOur earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains; while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe following table sets forth summary information concerning our production and operating data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The actual historical data in this table excludes results from the Reliance Acquisition for periods prior to October 2016. Because of normal production declines, increased or decreased drilling activities, fluctuations in commodity prices and the effects of acquisitions or divestitures, the historical information presented below should not be interpreted as being indicative of future results.\nWe evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In February 2017, we sold our ownership interest in ACC, which consisted of property in both Texas and New Mexico, and in April 2017, we completed an acquisition of assets in the Northern Delaware Basin. We have considered these and other factors and did not identify a shift in our projected future apportionment between New Mexico and Texas for the year ended December 31, 2017. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nOur geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis.\nTax reform. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States ( the President\u201d) signed into law the TCJA, significantly changing corporate income tax laws. According to Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) section 740, Income Taxes,\u201d a company is required to record the effects of an enacted tax law or rate change in income from continuing operations in the period of enactment, which is the date the bill is signed by the President and becomes law. We note that certain aspects of these changes will impact our future after-tax earnings primarily due to the lower federal statutory tax rate. The SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\u201d ( SAB 118\u201d) to provide guidance for companies that have not completed the accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment. SAB 118 allows companies to report provisional amounts when based on reasonable estimates and to adjust these amounts during a measurement period of up to one year.\n\nSAB 118, adjustments to provisional amounts included in the total income tax benefit are allowable during the one-year measurement period. We will continue to monitor new tax law interpretations.\n\u00b7 average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $3.07 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 38 percent from $2.23 per Mcf during 2016. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we realized approximately 102 percent and 87 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. The increase in our realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to an increase in the average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids. Historically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nImpairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. The following table provides the components of our production and ad valorem tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $66 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This amount includes: (i) approximately $36 million associated with the premium paid for the Tender Offer, approximately $25 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 5.5% Notes, approximately $21 million of unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $2 million of additional interest on the 5.5% Notes to October 13, 2017, which was paid in September 2017, reduced by approximately $19 million of unamortized premium; and (ii) approximately $1 million representing the proportional amount of unamortized deferred loan costs associated with banks that are no longer in the credit facility syndicate as a result of the April 2017 credit facility amendment.\n\u00b7 Average daily sales volumes increased by 28 percent from 150,511 Boe per day during 2016 to 192,658 Boe per day during 2017.\nOil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $1,635 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $169 million (9 percent) from $1,804 million for 2015. This decrease was primarily due to the decrease in realized oil and natural gas prices partially offset by an increase in natural gas production. Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following:\nGeneral and administrative expenses. The following table provides components of our general and administrative expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nLoss on extinguishment of debt. We recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs.\nCapital Commitments, Capital Resources and Liquidity\n\u2022 $951 million increase in oil and natural gas revenues as a result of a 28 percent increase in production and a 24 percent increase in commodity price realizations per Boe (excluding the effects of derivative activities);\nOil and natural gas production expenses. The following table provides the components of our oil and natural gas production expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nOil and natural gas revenues. Revenue from oil and natural gas operations was $2,586 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $951 million (58 percent) from $1,635 million for 2016. This increase was primarily due to the increase in realized oil and natural gas production as well as the increase in oil and natural gas prices (excluding the effects of derivative activities). Specific factors affecting oil and natural gas revenues include the following:\nGain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nThe increase in depreciation expense was primarily associated with additional other property and equipment related to buildings and other items.\nCommodity Prices\n\nOur other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals.\nGain (loss) on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $118 million and a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $54 million, respectively. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million. In December 2015, we completed an acreage exchange with Clayton Williams Energy, Inc. that consolidated acres into a concentrated, operated position in our Southern Delaware Basin core area. We recognized a loss on disposition of assets of approximately $50 million related to the acreage exchange.\n\u2022 $68 million increase in production and ad valorem tax expense, primarily due to increased production taxes as a result of increased oil and natural gas sales.\n\nOur financial and operating performance for 2017 included the following highlights:\n\u00b7 average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $39.90 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 11 percent from $44.69 per Bbl during 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(4.15) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2015. We incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. Additionally, the basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.15 per Bbl and $0.41 per Bbl, respectively;\nProduction and ad valorem taxes. The following table provides the components of our production and ad valorem tax expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nOur weighted average debt balance decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to (i) the satisfaction and discharge of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, (ii) the redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and (iii) the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes in September 2017, partially offset by (i) the issuance of the 4.375% Notes in December 2016, (ii) the issuance of the 2017 Notes in September 2017 and (iii) an increase in borrowings under our credit facility. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance and an increase in capitalized interest.\n\u00b7 Cash decreased by approximately $53 million during 2017 primarily as a result of cash paid to tender and extinguish the 5.5% Notes and cash paid for the Midland Basin and Northern Delaware Basin acquisitions, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of the 2017 Notes and proceeds from our February 2017 divestiture of ACC.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $226 million ($4.09 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $5 million (2 percent) from $231 million ($4.42 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in non-cash stock-based compensation was primarily due to an increase in forfeiture estimates. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in non-cash stock-based compensation costs noted above coupled with a slight increase in production.\nWe recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This amount includes: (i) approximately $20 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early extinguishment of the 6.5% Notes in December 2016, approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs and approximately $1 million of additional interest on the 6.5% Notes through January 16, 2017, which was paid in December 2016; and (ii) $21 million associated with the make-whole premium paid for the early redemption of the 7.0% Notes in September 2016 and approximately $7 million of related unamortized deferred loan costs.\n\u00b7 Net income was $956 million ($6.41 per diluted share) as compared to a net loss of $1.5 billion ($(10.85) per diluted share) in 2016. The increase was primarily due to:\nAcquisitions. The following table reflects our expenditures for acquisitions of proved and unproved properties for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nYear Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\nWe evaluate changes to our industry, production, market conditions and changes in our forecasted drilling plan by tax jurisdiction. Our material state tax jurisdictions include Texas and New Mexico. In October 2016, we purchased Texas-based assets in the Reliance Acquisition for approximately $1.7 billion, which caused a shift in our projected future apportionment from New Mexico to Texas, which has a lower statutory state tax rate than New Mexico. As such, we recognized an overall state deferred tax benefit of approximately $21 million and approximately $9 million for 2016 and 2015, respectively.\n\n\u00b7 Net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately $311 million to $1,695 million for 2017, as compared to $1,384 million in 2016, primarily due to increased oil and natural gas revenues and decreased cash interest expense, partially offset by (i) decreased cash settlements on derivatives, (ii) increased production expense and (iii) increased production tax expense.\nWe estimate undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management's assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2017, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2018 price of $59.55 per barrel of oil decreasing to a 2024 price of $51.82 per barrel of oil marginally recovering to a 2025 price of $51.83 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2018 price of $2.84 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2019 price of $2.81 per Mcf then rising to a 2025 price of $2.99 per Mcf of natural gas. Both oil and natural gas commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2025.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $25 million primarily related to expired and abandoned acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin core area where we currently have no intent to drill.\nAs we continue to implement and address the ongoing impacts of the TCJA, we may determine it necessary in the future to adjust our income tax calculations due to changes in our initial interpretations or assumptions. As we have elected to apply\nOur other expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of surface and title costs on locations we no longer intend to drill, certain plugging costs and delay rentals.\n\nreserves caused by (i) reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (ii) lower commodity prices.\nWe recognized a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $61 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of the carrying amount of certain of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets being less than their expected undiscounted future net cash flows, which was primarily attributable to properties in our eastern Midland Basin area.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nAlthough we cannot predict the occurrence of events that may affect future commodity prices or the degree to which these prices will be affected, the prices for any commodity that we produce will generally approximate current market prices in the geographic region of the production. From time to time, we expect that we may economically hedge a portion of our commodity price risk to mitigate the impact of price volatility on our business. See Notes 8 and 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our commodity derivative positions at December 31, 2017 and additional derivative contracts entered into subsequent to December 31, 2017, respectively.\nThe decrease in the weighted average debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 was due to the repayment of our credit facility using a portion of the proceeds from our October 2015 equity offering and, to a lesser extent, the early redemption of the $600 million outstanding principal amount of the 7.0% Notes. The decrease in interest expense was due to the overall decrease in the weighted average debt balance, partially offset by a reduction in capitalized interest.\n\u00b7 total natural gas production was 161,089 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 33,608 MMcf (26 percent) from 127,481 MMcf for 2016; and\n\nOur earnings are affected by the changes in value of our derivatives portfolio between periods and the related cash settlements of those derivatives, which could be significant. To the extent the future commodity price outlook declines between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market gains, while to the extent future commodity price outlook increases between measurement periods, we will have mark-to-market losses. See Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding significant judgments made in classifying financial instruments in the fair value hierarchy.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome tax provisions. We recorded an income tax benefit of approximately $876 million and income tax expense of approximately $31 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The shift in our income tax provision is primarily due to a significant pre-tax book loss in 2016 as compared to pre-tax book income in 2015. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were 38 percent and 32 percent, respectively.\n\nInterest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nProduction taxes per unit of production were $2.58 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21 percent from $2.13 per Boe during 2016. Over the same period, our revenue per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) increased 24 percent. The increase in production taxes per unit of production was directly related to the increase in oil and natural gas sales, partially offset by a $5 million tax credit received during 2017 related to certain wells in Texas qualifying for reduced severance tax rates, as compared to $4 million in tax credit received during 2016. Production taxes fluctuate with the market value of our production sold, while ad valorem taxes are generally based on the valuation of our oil and natural gas properties at the beginning of the year, which vary across the different areas in which we operate.\nExploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\n\nThe following table presents selected production data for the fields which represent greater than 15 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\n\u2022 $243 million decrease in the loss on derivatives; and\nGain on disposition of assets, net. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recognized a gain on disposition of assets of approximately $678 million and $118 million, respectively. In February 2017, we closed on the\nOur geological and geophysical expense for the periods presented above primarily consists of the costs of acquiring and processing geophysical data and core analysis.\nDerivative financial instrument exposure. At December 31, 2017, the fair value of our financial derivatives was a net liability of $379 million. Under the terms of our financial derivative instruments, we do not have exposure to potential margin calls\u201d on our financial derivative instruments. The terms of our credit facility do not allow us to offset amounts we may owe a lender against amounts we may be owed related to our financial instruments with such party. In September 2017, we elected to enter into an Investment Grade Period\u201d under our credit facility, which had the effect of releasing all collateral formerly securing the credit facility and derivative obligations. See Notes 9 and 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information.\nGeneral and administrative expenses were approximately $244 million ($3.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $18 million (8 percent) from $226 million ($4.09 per Boe) for 2016. The increase in cash general and administrative expenses was primarily a result of increased compensation expense. The decrease in total general and administrative expenses per Boe was primarily due to increased production, partially offset by the increase in cash general and administrative costs noted above.\nYear Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n\u2022 $560 million increase in gain on disposition of assets, net due to a gain of approximately $678 million during 2017 primarily attributable to our disposition of ACC, as compared to a gain of approximately $118 million during 2016 primarily attributable to our Northern Delaware Basin divestiture in February 2016;\n(b) Cash interest expense on our senior notes is estimated assuming no principal repayment until their maturity dates. Also included in the Less than 1 year\u201d column is accrued interest at December 31, 2017 of approximately $36 million. During 2017, we decreased our annual interest expense and extended our average maturity from six to 16 years by issuing the 2017 Notes and completing the satisfaction and discharge of the 5.5% Notes. At December 31, 2017, we had variable-rate debt outstanding under our credit facility of $322 million.\n\u00b7 total oil production was 43,472 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 9,632 MBbl (28 percent) from 33,840 MBbl for 2016;\nOther than the customary purchase of leasehold acreage, our capital budgets are exclusive of acquisitions. We do not have a specific acquisition budget, since the timing and size of acquisitions are difficult to forecast. We evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times. We seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties that provide opportunities for the addition of reserves and production through a combination of development, high-potential exploration and control of operations that will allow us to apply our operating expertise.\n\nCertain statements in our discussion below are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. Please see Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for further details about these statements.\n\u00b7 total oil production was 33,840 MBbl for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 617 MBbl (2 percent) from 34,457 MBbl for 2015;\n\u2022 $801 million change in our income tax provision primarily due to favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA, resulting in a provisional discrete income tax benefit of approximately $398 million. This benefit more than offset the $308 million income tax expense on income before taxes during 2017 at the federal statutory rate;\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expense. The following table provides components of our depreciation, depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we recorded approximately $29 million and $60 million, respectively, of leasehold abandonments. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) acreage expiring in our Southern Delaware Basin core area and (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas in locations where we have no future plans to drill. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our abandonments were primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas that, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin areas.\nWe estimate fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value.\npartially offset by:\nFinancial and Operating Performance\nHistorically, and during the year ended December 31, 2017, we derived a significant portion of our total natural gas revenues from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $25.06 per Bbl and $18.08 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\u00b7 average realized oil price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $48.13 per Bbl during the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of 21 percent from $39.90 per Bbl during 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX was $(2.84) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 94 percent, as compared to a crude oil price differential relative to NYMEX of $(3.52) per Bbl, or a realization of approximately 92 percent, for 2016. The basis differential between the location of Midland, Texas and Cushing, Oklahoma (NYMEX pricing location) for our oil directly impacts our realized oil price. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the average market basis differential between WTI-Midland and WTI-Cushing was a price reduction of $0.30 per Bbl and $0.15 per Bbl, respectively. Additionally, we incur fixed deductions from the posted Midland oil price based on the location of our oil within the Permian Basin. These fixed deductions were less per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to 2016 primarily due to more production transported through pipelines and successful renegotiation of fixed deductions for trucked volumes;\nOur results of operations are heavily influenced by commodity prices. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for a description of the factors that may impact future commodity prices, including the price of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids.\n\u2022 no recorded impairments of long-lived assets in 2017, as compared to $1.5 billion in non-cash impairment charges in 2016 primarily attributable to properties in our New Mexico Shelf area;\nImpairments of long-lived assets. We periodically review our long-lived assets to be held and used, including proved oil and natural gas properties and their integrated assets, whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable, for instance when there are declines in commodity prices or well performance. We review our oil and natural gas properties by depletion base. An impairment loss is indicated if the sum of the expected undiscounted future net cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets. If the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of our assets, we recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset.\nAlthough we have performed an initial assessment of the TCJA, we recognize that it is a comprehensive bill and the ultimate impacts may differ from our initial estimates due to changes in our interpretations as a result of additional regulatory guidance that may become available. As such, we have elected to apply SAB 118 and have recorded, based on reasonable estimates, provisional amounts of our income tax balances reported in our financial statements. See Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding our income tax balances.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2016, NYMEX strip prices declined as compared to December 31, 2015, and as a result the carrying amount of our Yeso field in our New Mexico Shelf core area exceeded the expected undiscounted future net cash flows resulting in a non-cash charge against earnings of approximately $1.5 billion. The Yeso field, as compared to our other fields not previously impaired, had significant proved reserves upon acquisition, which required a higher valuation than a field more exploratory in nature that has a higher risk factor adjustment in the fair value estimate. Our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining the estimated fair value at March 31, 2016 ranged from a 2016 price of $41.26 per barrel of oil and $2.26 per Mcf of natural gas to a 2022 price of $66.33 per barrel of oil and $3.56 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2022.\n\nExploration and abandonments expense. The following table provides the components of our exploration and abandonments expense for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n(c) Derivative obligations represent commodity derivatives that were valued at December 31, 2017. The ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative obligations are unknown because they are subject to continuing market risk. See\n\u00b7 total natural gas production was 127,481 MMcf for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of 20,494 MMcf (19 percent) from 106,987 MMcf for 2015; and\nOur exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2016 were primarily related to an uneconomic well in our Northern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish commercial production through testing of multiple zones. Our exploratory dry hole costs during the year ended December 31, 2015 were primarily related to (i) an uneconomic well in our Southern Delaware Basin core area that was attempting to establish production in an unconventional zone for the area and (ii) expensing an unsuccessful well, which we did not operate, that was located in our New Mexico Shelf core area.\nInterest expense. The following table sets forth interest expense, weighted average interest rates and weighted average debt balances for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nContractual obligations. We had the following contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:\nThe change in our income tax provision in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the favorable impacts of the tax law changes enacted through the TCJA in December 2017 as the income tax benefit related to the federal statutory rate change more than offset our income tax expense of $308 million on income before income taxes during 2017. The effective income tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were (9) percent and 38 percent, respectively. The 2017 rate was negative due to recognizing an overall income tax benefit while having pre-tax income.\nWe receive fees for the operation of jointly-owned oil and natural gas properties during the drilling and production phases and record such reimbursements as reductions of general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations. We earned reimbursements of approximately $16 million and $17 million during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\nIncome tax provisions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an income tax benefit of $75 million, which includes discrete provisional income tax benefits of approximately $398 million related to the enactment of the TCJA and $6 million related to stock-based awards recorded in the income tax provision pursuant to ASU No. 2016-09 adopted on January 1, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded an income tax benefit of $876 million primarily due to having a loss before income taxes.\nDepletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,122 million ($15.95 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $23 million (2 percent) from $1,145 million ($20.79 per Boe) for 2016. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) lower drilling and completion costs per Boe of proved developed reserves added, (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition as well as other acquisitions, and higher commodity prices, partially offset by decreased proved reserves caused by reclassification of proved undeveloped reserves to unproved reserves because they are no longer expected to be developed within five years of the date of their initial recognition and (iii) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016.\nProduction taxes per unit of production were $2.13 per Boe during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 13 percent from $2.46 per Boe during 2015. The decrease was directly related to the decrease in oil and natural gas prices. Over the same period, our average realized prices per Boe (excluding the effects of derivatives) decreased 14 percent.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized leasehold abandonment expense of approximately $50 million primarily related to (i) drilling locations in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas which, based on multiple factors, are no longer likely to be drilled, (ii) acreage in our Northern Delaware Basin and New Mexico Shelf core areas where we have no future development plans and (iii) expiring acreage primarily located in our Northern Delaware Basin and Southern Delaware Basin core areas.\n\u00b7 average realized natural gas price (excluding the effects of derivative activities) was $2.23 per Mcf during the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of 9 percent from $2.46 per Mcf during 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we realized approximately 87 percent and 94 percent, respectively, of the average NYMEX natural gas prices for the respective periods. Factors contributing to the decrease in our realized gas price (excluding the effects of derivatives) as a percentage of NYMEX during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to 2015 were (i) a decrease in the posted regional natural gas prices on which we are paid while the NYMEX natural gas price decreased at a lesser rate and (ii) increased deductions and fees from the regional natural gas price, comparatively. Over the past three years, approximately half of our total natural gas revenues have been derived from the value of the natural gas liquids contained in our natural gas, with the remaining portion coming from the value of the dry natural gas residue. The average Mont Belvieu price for a blended barrel of natural gas liquids was $18.08 per Bbl and $17.80 per Bbl during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOverview\nLease operating expenses were $301 million ($5.46 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was a decrease of $61 million (17 percent) from $362 million ($6.93 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in lease operating expenses was primarily due to (i) implementation of operational cost efficiencies and (ii) an overall decrease in the cost of goods and services. The decrease in lease operating expenses per Boe was primarily due to the reduction in lease operating expenses noted above coupled with a slight increase in production.\nWorkover expenses were approximately $19 million and $28 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease was primarily related to less overall activity during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nDepletion of proved oil and natural gas properties was $1,145 million ($20.79 per Boe) for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $58 million (5 percent) from $1,203 million ($23.02 per Boe) for 2015. The decrease in depletion expense was primarily due to a lower depletion rate per Boe partially offset by an increase in production. The decrease in depletion expense per Boe was primarily due to (i) a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $1.5 billion recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and (ii) an overall increase in proved reserves primarily caused by our successful exploratory drilling program, the Reliance Acquisition and reductions in future estimated lease operating expenses, partially offset by decreased proved\nGain (loss) on derivatives. The following table sets forth the gain (loss) on derivatives for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nWe calculate the expected undiscounted future net cash flows of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using management's assumptions and expectations of (i) commodity prices, which are based on the NYMEX strip, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves and (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets. At December 31, 2016, our estimates of commodity prices for purposes of determining undiscounted future cash flows, which are based on the NYMEX strip, ranged from a 2017 price of $56.19 per barrel of oil to a 2024 price of $57.41 per barrel of oil. Similarly, natural gas prices ranged from a 2017 price of $3.61 per Mcf of natural gas decreasing to a 2020 price of $2.88 per Mcf of natural gas partially recovering to a 2024 price of $3.38 per Mcf of natural gas. Commodity prices for this purpose were held flat after 2024.\nWe calculate the estimated fair values of our long-lived assets and their integrated assets using a discounted future cash flow model. Fair value assumptions associated with the calculation of discounted future net cash flows include (i) market estimates of commodity prices, (ii) pricing adjustments for differentials, (iii) production costs, (iv) capital expenditures, (v) production volumes, (vi) estimated proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, (vii) prevailing market rates of income and expenses from integrated assets and (viii) discount rate. The expected future net cash flows were discounted using an annual rate of 10 percent to determine fair value.\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes, as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data included elsewhere in this report.\nFurther, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price reached highs and lows of $66.14 and $59.19 per Bbl and $3.63 and $2.55 per MMBtu, respectively, during the period from January 1, 2018 to February 16, 2018. At February 16, 2018, the NYMEX oil price and NYMEX natural gas price were $61.68 per Bbl and $2.56 per MMBtu, respectively.\n\nPotential cost inflation. Oilfield service and supply costs are also subject to supply and demand dynamics. As companies have expanded their drilling and development activities during 2017, the demand for third-party oilfield services and suppliers has also increased. As such, if the commodity price environment continues to trend upward, we expect demand for oilfield services and supplies to continue to grow, and the costs of drilling, equipping and operating our wells and infrastructure could begin to rise.\n(a) See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for information regarding future interest payment obligations on our long-term debt. The amounts included in the table above represent principal maturities only.\nSouthern Delaware Basin divestitures. In January 2018, we closed on two asset sales transactions of certain non-core assets in Reeves and Ward Counties with combined preliminary proceeds of approximately $280 million, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. As of December 31, 2017, we received cash deposits totaling approximately $29 million for the asset sales, which was included in the total cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d for additional information regarding these divestitures.\ndivestiture of our ownership interest in ACC. After adjustments for debt and working capital, we received cash proceeds from the sale of approximately $801 million. After direct transaction costs, we recorded a pre-tax gain on disposition of assets of approximately $655 million. Our net investment in ACC at the time of closing was approximately $129 million. In February 2016, we sold certain assets in our Northern Delaware Basin core area for proceeds of approximately $292 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of approximately $110 million.\nNew commodity derivative contracts. After December 31, 2017, we entered into the following oil price swaps, oil basis swaps and natural gas price swaps to hedge additional amounts of our estimated future production:\nOil and natural gas prices have been subject to significant fluctuations during the past several years. The average oil and natural gas prices were higher during 2017 compared to 2016. The following table sets forth the average NYMEX oil and natural gas prices for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the high and low NYMEX prices for the same periods:\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the acquisition, development, exploration and production of oil and natural gas properties. Our core operations are primarily focused in the Permian Basin of southeast New Mexico and west Texas. Concho's legacy in the Permian Basin provides us a deep understanding of operating and geological trends. We are actively developing our resource base by utilizing extended length lateral drilling, enhanced completion techniques, multi-well pad locations and large-scale development projects throughout our four core operating areas: the Northern Delaware Basin, the Southern Delaware Basin, the Midland Basin and the New Mexico Shelf. Oil comprised 60 percent of our 840 MMBoe of estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2017 and 62 percent of our 70 MMBoe of production for 2017. We seek to operate the wells in which we own an interest, and we operated wells that accounted for 92 percent of our proved developed producing reserves and 79 percent of our 8,152 gross wells at December 31, 2017. By controlling operations, we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties, including the drilling and stimulation methods used.",

Oil makes up 60% of estimated proved reserves and 62% of 2017 production. They seek to operate the wells they own - 92% of proved developed producing reserves are operated.\n\n2017 Financial and Operating Highlights\n- Net income was $956 million compared to a $1.5 billion net loss in 2016, largely due to higher revenues, lower impairment charges, and tax benefits. \n- Oil and gas revenues increased 58% to $2.6 billion due to 28% higher production volumes and 24% higher realized commodity prices.\n- Total proved reserves were 840 MMBoe. \n\nCommodity Prices \n- Average NYMEX oil and gas prices were higher in 2017 than 2016. Oil ranged from $42.53-$60.42 per barrel and gas ranged from $2.56-$3.72 per MMBtu.\n\nCapital Commitments\n- 2018 capital budget is $2.0 billion, focused 93% on drilling and completions. Expected to be funded through operating cash flows.\n\nIncome Taxes\n- Recorded $75 million tax benefit in 2017 vs $876 million in 2016. Includes $398 million benefit from Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.\n\nImpairments\n- No impairments in 2017 compared to $1.5 billion charge in 2016 primarily on New Mexico Shelf assets.\n\nThat covers the key financial performance, reserves, commodity pricing, capital spending, tax, and impairment details. Let me know if you need any part summarized further."}
