Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRecent Developments - On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.95% Senior Notes due 2028 initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries. We used $239 million of the net proceeds from the sale to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nOn October 11, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of MS Directional. The aggregate consideration paid by us consisted of $69.8 million in cash and approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock. Based on the closing price of our common stock on the closing date of the transaction, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of MS Directional was approximately $257 million.\nMS Directional is a leading directional drilling services company in the United States, with operations in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins. MS Directional provides a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, downhole performance motors, directional surveying, measurement while drilling, and wireline steering tools. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the MS Directional business since October 11, 2017.\nOn December 12, 2016, we entered into the merger agreement with SSE. On April 20, 2017, pursuant to the merger agreement, a subsidiary of ours was merged with and into SSE, with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of SSE, in exchange for approximately 46.3 million shares of our common stock. Concurrent with the closing of the merger, we repaid all of the outstanding debt of SSE totaling $472 million. Based on the closing price of our common stock on April 20, 2017, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of SSE was approximately $1.5 billion. On April 20, 2017, following the SSE merger, SSE was merged with and into our newly-formed subsidiary SSE LLC, with SSE LLC continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nThrough the SSE merger, we acquired a fleet of 91 drilling rigs, 36 of which we consider to be APEX\u00ae rigs. Additionally, through the SSE merger, we acquired approximately 500,000 horsepower of modern, efficient fracturing equipment located in Oklahoma and Texas. The oilfield rentals business acquired through the SSE merger has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium oilfield rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the SSE businesses since April 20, 2017.\nQuarterly average oil prices and our quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2015, 2016 and 2017 are as follows:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1st\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2nd\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3rd\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4th\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2015:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average oil price per Bbl (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average rigs operating per day - U.S. (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average oil price per Bbl (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average rigs operating per day - U.S. (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2017:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average oil price per Bbl (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 51.77\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.24\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.16\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 55.37\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average rigs operating per day - U.S. (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014. Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016. Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016. Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nOur rig count in the United States declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014, but has improved since the second quarter of 2016. Our average rig count in the United States was 159 rigs for both the third and fourth quarter of 2017, with the third quarter of 2017 being the first quarter with a full quarter contribution from the rigs acquired in the SSE merger. Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2017 was 163 rigs. Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years. Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 96 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2018 and an average of 67 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2018.\nActivity levels in our pressure pumping business also improved during 2017, especially in the Permian Basin. We reactivated two frac spreads during the third quarter, and one additional frac spread during the fourth quarter. With the addition of these three frac spreads, we exited 2017 with 23 active frac spreads or approximately 1.25 million active fracturing horsepower.\nManagement Overview - We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment. Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America. Our pressure pumping business operates primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions. We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States, and we also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors in North America and other select markets. In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.\nWe have addressed our customers' needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years. As of December 31, 2017, our rig fleet included 199 APEX\u00ae rigs.\nIn connection with the development of horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, in the last five years we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1.6 million horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet. In recent years, the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace and lower oil and natural gas prices have led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.\nWe maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more. Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $544 million and $417 million, respectively. Approximately 19% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2017 is reasonably expected to remain after 2018. We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract. The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract. In addition, our term drilling contracts are generally subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer. For contracts that we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.\u201d\nOur revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services. Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens, and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services. We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Please see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Report.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,040,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 543,663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,153,892\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pressure pumping\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,200,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 354,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 712,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 37.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directional drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 70,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,356,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 915,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,891,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGenerally, the revenues in our contract drilling segment are most impacted by two primary factors: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day. During 2017, our average number of rigs operating was 136 in the United States and two in Canada, compared to 63 in the United States and two in Canada in 2016, and 120 in the United States and four in Canada in 2015. Our average rig revenue per operating day was $20,620 in 2017, compared to $23,040 in 2016 and $25,560 in 2015.\nGenerally, the revenues in our pressure pumping segment are most impacted by our number of fracturing jobs and the size (including whether or not we provide proppant and other materials) of those jobs, which is reflected in our average revenue per fracturing job. We completed 622 fracturing jobs during 2017 compared to 352 fracturing jobs in 2016 and 610 fracturing jobs in 2015. Our average revenue per fracturing job was $1.894 million in 2017 compared to $982,560 in 2016 and $1.118 million in 2015.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, our operating income (loss) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (171,897\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (235,858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (78,970\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pressure pumping\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (176,628\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (254,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directional drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,813\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,391\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,269\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (120,835\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40,349\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58,735\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (292,538\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (456,226\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (406,972\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDiscussion of our operating income (loss) follows in the Results of Operations\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nOn December 22, 2017, significant U.S. tax law changes were enacted ( tax reform\u201d). Tax reform reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax reform, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 of approximately $219 million of tax benefit as a result of tax reform, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.

Operating days and average rigs operating increased due to a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry and the rigs acquired in the SSE merger. Depreciation, amortization and impairment increased due to the additional SSE assets and due to a $29.0 million impairment from the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability. There was no similar charge in 2016. Average revenue per operating day decreased during 2017 due to a reduction in early termination revenue and the expiration of higher day rate, legacy long-term rig contracts. Early termination revenue in 2017 was $4.9 million, compared to $24.6 million in 2016. Average direct operating costs per operating day increased as a result of a reduction in the proportion of rigs on standby and an increase in rig reactivation expenses. Capital expenditures increased due to upgrading rigs to super-spec capability, building a new rig, higher maintenance capital expenditures and other general property and equipment upgrades.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pressure Pumping\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,200,311\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 354,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 239.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 966,835\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 334,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 189.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 233,476\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,098.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, amortization and impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 198,006\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (176,628\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fracturing jobs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other jobs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total jobs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per fracturing job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,894.40\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 982.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 92.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per other job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per total job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 637.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 307.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 107.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average direct operating costs per total job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 513.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 290.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average margin per total job (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 123.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 632.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin as a percentage of revenues (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 254.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 171,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 333.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.

Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million. Early termination revenues were approximately $24.6 million in 2016. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 included a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components. There were no similar charges in 2016. Capital expenditures were significantly lower as no new rigs were added to the fleet in 2016 and drilling activity was lower, which required less maintenance capital.\nTable 138: <table></table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pressure Pumping\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 354,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 712,454\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (50.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 334,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 612,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (45.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100,433\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (31.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, amortization and impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 184,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 214,552\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13.8\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (176,628\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (254,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (30.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fracturing jobs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (42.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other jobs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61.6\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total jobs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (57.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per fracturing job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 982.56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,117.95\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per other job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10.28\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14.66\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29.9\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per total job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 307.62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 264.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average direct operating costs per total job\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 290.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 227.52\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average margin per total job (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16.93\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37.34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (54.7\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin as a percentage of revenues (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures and acquisitions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 39,584\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 197,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80.0\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses.

The total number of jobs decreased as a result of the downturn in the oil and natural gas industry. Lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $22.0 million related to the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities.

As a result, we expensed $1.4 million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs in 2016 related to these bank term loans.\nIncome Taxes\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (327,801\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (496,196\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (442,449\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (333,711\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (177,562\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (147,963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State income taxes - net of the federal income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent differences\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> One-time tax effects of tax reform\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share-based payments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisition related differences\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other differences, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate increased by approximately 66.0% to 101.8% for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a 66.7% increase related to the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and a 3.6% increase for excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation deductions. These increases were partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in the effective tax rate for acquisitions that resulted in the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new state tax rates at which they are expected to reverse. The lower 2015 effective rate is primarily related to the impact of goodwill impairment charges in 2015 along with an adjustment to our deferred tax liability associated with the 2010 conversion of our Canadian operations to a controlled foreign corporation.\nTax reform reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a new limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes. Based on a reduced US federal corporate tax rate of 21% from tax reform, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. Due to the limited time to consider tax reform and its various interpretations, we are still analyzing and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, of approximately $219 million of tax benefit, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations resulting in the above impact to our 2017 effective tax rate. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report for additional information related to the impact of tax reform.\nPrior to tax reform, we had elected to permanently reinvest unremitted earnings in Canada effective January 1, 2010, and we intended to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result, no deferred U.S. federal or state income taxes had been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings. With the enactment of tax reform, there is a new territorial tax system that provides for a 100% dividends received deduction on future earnings, if remitted. However, we will need to continue to evaluate our reinvestment intentions on future earnings and any other residual basis differences in order to determine whether we can continue to assert indefinite reinvestment or whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes that would be due on future earnings if remitted, such as foreign withholding taxes or state and local taxes. We will also need to determine whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes on any other outside basis differences in our foreign operations. Due to the limited time to consider these provisions, we are still evaluating how tax reform will affect our existing accounting position to indefinitely reinvest unremitted foreign earnings. We will continue to assert permanent reinvestment with respect to future unremitted earnings and have not recorded any deferred federal or state income taxes that would be provided on future unremitted earnings. We will finalize our intentions on whether we will permanently reinvest our foreign unremitted earnings within the measurement period provided under SAB 118.\nWe record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled. As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized. We recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $330 million in 2017, $152 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2015.\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation\u201d (ASU 2016-09). The new standard was effective for us on January 1, 2017. Among other provisions, the new standard requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as income tax benefits and expenses in the income statement. Previously, such amounts were recorded to additional paid-in-capital. This aspect of the new guidance was required to be adopted prospectively. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $12 million of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the period.\nDuring 2017, we had significant merger and acquisition activity. Based on this activity, we evaluated our overall state deferred tax rate, resulting in a slightly increased rate. We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and recorded additional taxes of approximately $11 million, resulting in the above impact to the 2017 effective tax rate.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity as of December 31, 2017 included approximately $201 million in working capital, including $42.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $227 million available under our revolving credit facility.\nWe believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations in 2018, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash flows from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $201 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.8 million, compared to negative working capital of $17.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, at December 31, 2016.\nDuring 2017, our sources of cash flow included:\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $301 million from operating activities,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $60.9 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $268 million in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $472 million from net proceeds from common stock issuance.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2017, we used $502 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of SSE and MS Directional, $16.3 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $6.8 million to acquire shares of our common stock and $567 million:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> to make capital expenditures for the acquisition, betterment and refurbishment of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> to acquire and procure equipment and facilities to support our drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rental and manufacturing operations, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Per Share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paid on March 22, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paid on June 22, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paid on September 21, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,271\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Paid on December 21, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.02\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash dividends\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.08\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.02 per share to be paid on March 22, 2018 to holders of record as of March 8, 2018. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.\nOn September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. All purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions. Purchases under the program are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be made at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock purchased under the plan are held as treasury shares. There is no expiration date associated with the buyback program. As of December 31, 2017, we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2013 stock buyback program.\nWe acquired shares of stock from directors in 2017 and 2016 and from employees during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that are accounted for as treasury stock. Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options. The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll withholding obligations upon the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock. These shares were acquired at fair market value. These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.\nTreasury stock acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Shares\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury shares at beginning of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,392,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 911,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,207,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 907,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42,818,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 899,035\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases pursuant to 2013 stock buyback program\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,503\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Acquisitions pursuant to long-term incentive plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 404,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,508\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 176,889\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 380,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Treasury shares at end of period\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,802,611\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 918,711\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,392,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 911,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,207,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 907,045\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2012 Credit Agreement - On September 27, 2012, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( Base Credit Agreement\u201d). The Base Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d) is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.\nOn July 8, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 2\u201d), which amended the Base Credit Agreement to, among other things, make borrowings under the revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to our and certain of our subsidiaries' eligible equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and unencumbered cash as described in Amendment No. 2. The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $50 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $20 million, in each case outstanding at any time. The maturity date under the Base Credit Agreement was September 27, 2017 for the revolving credit facility; however, Amendment No. 2 extended the maturity date of $357.9 million in revolving credit commitments of certain lenders to March 27, 2019. On January 17, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement, which amended the Credit Agreement by restating the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for the add-back of transaction expenses related to the SSE merger. On January 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with certain lenders under our revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility to approximately $595.8 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The aggregate commitment increase became effective on April 20, 2017 upon the consummation of the SSE merger and the repayment and termination of the SSE credit facility. On April 20, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement which permitted outstanding letters of credit under the SSE credit facility to be deemed to be incurred under our credit facility and increased the amount of the accordion feature of our revolving credit facility to permit aggregate commitments to be increased to an amount not to exceed $700 million (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders). On April 20, 2017, we also entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to both commitment increases) increased to $632 million through September 2017 and to $490 million through March 2019. On October 27, 2017, we entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility increased to $500 million through March 27, 2019.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate. Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varied from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varied from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio. Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 3.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 2.50%. A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit. The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is 0.50%.\nEach of our domestic subsidiaries unconditionally guarantees all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and ours arising under the Credit Agreement, other than (a) Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, (b) domestic subsidiaries that directly or indirectly have no material assets other than equity interests in, or capitalization indebtedness owed by, foreign subsidiaries, and (c) any subsidiary having total assets of less than $1 million. Such guarantees also cover our or any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants. We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 40%. The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.\nThe Credit Agreement limits our ability to make investments in foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures such that, if the book value of all such investments since September 27, 2012 is above 20% of our total consolidated book value of the assets on a pro forma basis, we will not be able to make such investment. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to pay dividends and make equity repurchases, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception allowing such restricted payments if before and immediately after giving effect to such restricted payment, the Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is at least 1.50 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, if our consolidated cash balance, subject to certain exclusions, is more than $100 million at the end of the day on which a borrowing is made, we can only use the proceeds from such borrowing to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and the repurchase of indebtedness, and if such proceeds are not used in such manner within three business days, we must repay such unused proceeds on the fourth business day following such borrowings.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.\nEvents of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to (i) terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii) accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to our insolvency and bankruptcy, such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $268 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 5.71%. We had $4.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 and, as a result, had available borrowing capacity of $227 million at that date. As of February 16, 2018, we had repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, had approximately $118,000 of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and had borrowing capacity of $499.9 million.\n2015 Reimbursement Agreement - On March 16, 2015, we entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the Reimbursement Agreement\u201d) with The Bank of Nova Scotia ( Scotiabank\u201d), pursuant to which we may from time to time request that Scotiabank issue an unspecified amount of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017, we had $54.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Reimbursement Agreement.\nUnder the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit. Fees, charges and other reasonable expenses for the issuance of letters of credit are payable by us at the time of issuance at such rates and amounts as are in accordance with Scotiabank's prevailing practice. We are obligated to pay to Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum, calculated daily and payable monthly, in arrears, on the basis of a calendar year for the actual number of days elapsed, with interest on overdue interest at the same rate as on the reimbursement amounts.\nWe have also agreed that if obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on any of our subsidiaries' property, then our reimbursement obligations and (to the extent similar obligations would be secured under the Credit Agreement) other obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement and any letters of credit will be equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such liens securing the Credit Agreement.\nPursuant to a Continuing Guaranty dated as of March 16, 2015 (the Continuing Guaranty\u201d), our payment obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed as to payment and not as to collection by our subsidiaries that from time to time guarantee payment under the Credit Agreement.\nSeries A & B Senior Notes - On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the Series A Notes\u201d) in a private placement. The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum. We pay interest on the Series A Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year. The Series A Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.\nOn June 14, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amounts of our 4.27% Series B Senior Notes due June 14, 2022 (the Series B Notes\u201d) in a private placement. The Series B Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.27% per annum. We pay interest on the Series B Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year. The Series B Notes will mature on June 14, 2022.\nThe Series A Notes and Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness. The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that are not required to be guarantors under the Credit Agreement.\nThe Series A Notes and Series B Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a make-whole\u201d premium as specified in the note purchase agreements. We must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of any change of control. In addition, we must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets. If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.\nThe respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants. We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time. The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00. The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017. We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.\nEvents of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if we default in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.\n2028 Senior Notes - On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries. The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $521 million of which we used $239 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nWe pay interest on the 2028 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 2028 Notes will mature on February 1, 2028. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.95% per annum.\nThe 2028 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our other future subordinated debt. The 2028 Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the 2028 Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2028 Notes. The guarantors' guarantees of the 2028 Notes (the Guarantees\u201d) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors' future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the guarantors' future subordinated debt. The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the guarantors' future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In the future, the Guarantees may be released and terminated under certain circumstances.\nWe, at our option, may redeem the Notes in whole or part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium. Additionally, commencing on November 1, 2027, we, at our option, may redeem the 2028 Notes in whole or part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date.\nThe indenture pursuant to which the 2028 Notes were issued includes covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens, engage in sale and lease-back transactions or consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to important qualifications and limitations set forth in the indenture.\nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, each holder of the 2028 Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder's 2028 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\nThe indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the 2028 Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.\nCommon Stock Offering - On January 27, 2017, we completed an offering of 18.2 million shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of $472 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay of SSE's outstanding indebtedness of approximately $472 million.\nCommitments and Contingencies - As of December 31, 2017, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $59.5 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts. These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to purchase approximately $172 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.\nOur pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $140 million, of which materials with a total purchase price of approximately $35.9 million were required to be purchased during 2018. In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.\nTrading and Investing - We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts. We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table presents information with respect

EBITDA\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense (including impairment of goodwill). We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and a comparison of the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss). Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as other similarly titled measures of other companies. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of net income (loss).\nTable 166: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (318,634\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (294,486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (333,711\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (177,562\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (147,963\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40,039\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 783,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 668,434\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 864,759\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 124,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 491,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 212,277\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 582,382\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.\nProperty and equipment - Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis. No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.\nOn a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs). The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment. The remaining components of these rigs will be retired. In 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability. In 2016, we retired 19 mechanical rigs but recorded no impairment charge as we had written down mechanical rigs that were still marketed in 2015. In 2015, we identified 24 mechanical rigs and nine non-APEX\u00ae electric rigs that would no longer be marketed. Also, we had 15 additional mechanical rigs that continued to be marketed but were not operating and which we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs. In 2015, we recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remained marketed but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.\nWe also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, we recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities. There were no similar charges in 2017 or 2016.\nWe review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives ( triggering events\u201d). In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings. The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time. Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate. We estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment. These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management's expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future. Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset's net book value. Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.\nBased on current commodity prices, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and management's expectations of operating results in future periods, we concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to our reporting segments. Our expectations of future operating results were based on the assumption that activity levels in all segments and our other operations will remain relatively stable or improve in response to relatively stable or increasing oil prices.\nWe concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, with respect to our reporting segments, based on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, our expectations of operating results in future periods and the prevailing commodity prices at the time.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015. In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses. As a result of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we concluded a triggering event had occurred and deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping. We performed a Step 1 analysis to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments. With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 60%, respectively.\nDue to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to once again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping. We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments. With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.\nFor both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Rigs not under term contracts would be subject to pricing in the spot market. Utilization and rates for rigs in the spot market and for the pressure pumping segment were estimated based upon our historical experience in prior downturns. Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in response to improved oil prices.\nGoodwill - Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be our operating segments. We determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if this is the case, any necessary goodwill impairment is determined using a quantitative impairment test. From time to time, we may perform quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment. If the resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the shortfall.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity will now perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We adopted this update in 2017. Prior to adoption we first determined whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if so, the resulting goodwill impairment was determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step of the quantitative testing was to compare the fair value of an entity's reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing was performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill. If this resulting fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss was recognized in the amount of such shortfall.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount. In making this determination, we considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in our reporting units, as well as our operating results for 2017 and 2016 and forecasted operating results for the respective succeeding year. Management also considered our overall market capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015. In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses. As a result of our revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for our contract drilling and pressure pumping services, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2015. In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods. The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling and pressure pumping reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.\nBased on the results of the Step 1 goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping reporting unit. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our pressure pumping reporting unit.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of the goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit. In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods. The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums. Based on the results of the quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill, as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit.\nRevenue recognition - Revenues from our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rental and pipe handling components and related technology activities are recognized as services are performed. All of the wells we drilled in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were drilled under daywork contracts. Revenues from sales of products are recognized upon customer acceptance. Revenues are presented net of any sales tax charged to the customer that we are required to remit to local or state governmental taxing authorities.\nReimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services, shipping and other services that are provided at the request of our customers are recorded as revenue when incurred. The related costs are recorded as operating expense when incurred.\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nKey estimates used by management include:\nTable 167: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> allowance for doubtful accounts,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> depreciation, depletion and amortization,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions,\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.\nVolatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition\nOur revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices. For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control. Please see Risk Factors - We are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers' Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results\u201d in Item 1A of this Report. The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014. Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016. Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016. Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017. In response to improved prices, U.S. rig counts have increased, and we believe they will continue to increase throughout 2018 if prices for these commodities remain at or above current levels.\nWe expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers' expectations of future oil and natural gas prices. A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.\nImpact of Inflation\nInflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2017. We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.", "item_7_truncated": "Revenue recognition - Revenues from our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rental and pipe handling components and related technology activities are recognized as services are performed. All of the wells we drilled in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were drilled under daywork contracts. Revenues from sales of products are recognized upon customer acceptance. Revenues are presented net of any sales tax charged to the customer that we are required to remit to local or state governmental taxing authorities.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Notes - On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the Series A Notes\u201d) in a private placement. The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum. We pay interest on the Series A Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year. The Series A Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation\u201d (ASU 2016-09). The new standard was effective for us on January 1, 2017. Among other provisions, the new standard requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as income tax benefits and expenses in the income statement. Previously, such amounts were recorded to additional paid-in-capital. This aspect of the new guidance was required to be adopted prospectively. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $12 million of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the period.\n\n \u2022 $301 million from operating activities, \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity will now perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We adopted this update in 2017. Prior to adoption we first determined whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if so, the resulting goodwill impairment was determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step of the quantitative testing was to compare the fair value of an entity's reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing was performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill. If this resulting fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss was recognized in the amount of such shortfall.\nDuring 2017, we had significant merger and acquisition activity. Based on this activity, we evaluated our overall state deferred tax rate, resulting in a slightly increased rate. We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and recorded additional taxes of approximately $11 million, resulting in the above impact to the 2017 effective tax rate.\nInflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2017. We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense (including impairment of goodwill). We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and a comparison of the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss). Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as other similarly titled measures of other companies. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of net income (loss).\nThe following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nWe have addressed our customers' needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years. As of December 31, 2017, our rig fleet included 199 APEX\u00ae rigs.\nIn connection with the development of horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, in the last five years we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1.6 million horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet. In recent years, the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace and lower oil and natural gas prices have led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.\nThe Credit Agreement limits our ability to make investments in foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures such that, if the book value of all such investments since September 27, 2012 is above 20% of our total consolidated book value of the assets on a pro forma basis, we will not be able to make such investment. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to pay dividends and make equity repurchases, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception allowing such restricted payments if before and immediately after giving effect to such restricted payment, the Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is at least 1.50 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, if our consolidated cash balance, subject to certain exclusions, is more than $100 million at the end of the day on which a borrowing is made, we can only use the proceeds from such borrowing to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and the repurchase of indebtedness, and if such proceeds are not used in such manner within three business days, we must repay such unused proceeds on the fourth business day following such borrowings.\n\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Operations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,931\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.3\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Direct operating costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,384\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.1\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Margin (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,431\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (27.4\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,026\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 116.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion and impairment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,301\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (61.5\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3,391\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,269\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (76.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,116\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,625\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (63.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommitments and Contingencies - As of December 31, 2017, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $59.5 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts.

Declines in Customers' Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results\u201d in Item 1A of this Report. The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014. Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016. Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016. Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017. In response to improved prices, U.S. rig counts have increased, and we believe they will continue to increase throughout 2018 if prices for these commodities remain at or above current levels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (Dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,646\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49,198\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Merger and integration expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 74,451\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> NA\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,695\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 40.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net gain on asset disposals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (33,510\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,771\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 126.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, including legal settlements, net of insurance reimbursements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,553\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 246.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating income, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (31,957\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (14,323\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,866\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 470.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,472\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 40,366\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 397.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital expenditures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenues from other operations decreased as a result of lower production and lower oil prices which resulted in lower revenues from our oil and natural gas working interests.

Depreciation, depletion and impairment expense in 2016 includes approximately $2.8 million of oil and natural gas property impairments as compared to approximately $10.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2015.\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1st\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2nd\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3rd\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4th\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Quarter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2016:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average oil price per Bbl (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 33.18\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 45.41\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 49.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 43.15\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average natural gas price per Mcf (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.00\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.88\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3.04\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.51\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average oil price per Bbl (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.54\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 57.85\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46.42\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 41.96\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 48.69\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average natural gas price per Mcf (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.90\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.75\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.76\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.63\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTax reform reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a new limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes. Based on a reduced US federal corporate tax rate of 21% from tax reform, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. Due to the limited time to consider tax reform and its various interpretations, we are still analyzing and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, of approximately $219 million of tax benefit, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations resulting in the above impact to our 2017 effective tax rate.

Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers' expectations of future oil and natural gas prices. A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.\n (3) Interest to be paid on the Series A Notes using 4.97% coupon rate. \n\nThe improvement in demand for our services and the income tax rate change resulted in consolidated net income of $5.9 million for 2017 compared to a consolidated net loss of $319 million for 2016 and a consolidated net loss of $294 million for 2015.\n\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (171,897\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (235,858\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (78,970\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pressure pumping\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.2\n</td> <td> )%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (176,628\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 38.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (254,998\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 62.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Directional drilling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (21\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (20,813\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3,391\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14,269\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (120,835\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (40,349\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (58,735\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (292,538\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (456,226\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (406,972\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, we recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities.

The related costs are recorded as operating expense when incurred.\nEvents of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if we default in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.\n\nThe Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants. We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 40%. The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.\nUnder the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit. Fees, charges and other reasonable expenses for the issuance of letters of credit are payable by us at the time of issuance at such rates and amounts as are in accordance with Scotiabank's prevailing practice. We are obligated to pay to Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum, calculated daily and payable monthly, in arrears, on the basis of a calendar year for the actual number of days elapsed, with interest on overdue interest at the same rate as on the reimbursement amounts.\n2015 Reimbursement Agreement - On March 16, 2015, we entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the Reimbursement Agreement\u201d) with The Bank of Nova Scotia ( Scotiabank\u201d), pursuant to which we may from time to time request that Scotiabank issue an unspecified amount of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017, we had $54.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Reimbursement Agreement.\nDuring 2017, our sources of cash flow included:\nWe acquired shares of stock from directors in 2017 and 2016 and from employees during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that are accounted for as treasury stock. Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options. The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll withholding obligations upon the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock. These shares were acquired at fair market value. These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.\nThe 2028 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our other future subordinated debt. The 2028 Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the 2028 Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2028 Notes. The guarantors' guarantees of the 2028 Notes (the Guarantees\u201d) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors' future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the guarantors' future subordinated debt. The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the guarantors' future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In the future, the Guarantees may be released and terminated under certain circumstances.\nOur directional drilling segment originated with the October 11, 2017 acquisition of MS Directional, and consequently we have no results for the prior year in this segment.\nPrior to tax reform, we had elected to permanently reinvest unremitted earnings in Canada effective January 1, 2010, and we intended to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result, no deferred U.S. federal or state income taxes had been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings. With the enactment of tax reform, there is a new territorial tax system that provides for a 100% dividends received deduction on future earnings, if remitted. However, we will need to continue to evaluate our reinvestment intentions on future earnings and any other residual basis differences in order to determine whether we can continue to assert indefinite reinvestment or whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes that would be due on future earnings if remitted, such as foreign withholding taxes or state and local taxes. We will also need to determine whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes on any other outside basis differences in our foreign operations. Due to the limited time to consider these provisions, we are still evaluating how tax reform will affect our existing accounting position to indefinitely reinvest unremitted foreign earnings. We will continue to assert permanent reinvestment with respect to future unremitted earnings and have not recorded any deferred federal or state income taxes that would be provided on future unremitted earnings. We will finalize our intentions on whether we will permanently reinvest our foreign unremitted earnings within the measurement period provided under SAB 118.\nQuarterly average oil prices and our quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2015, 2016 and 2017 are as follows:\n (2) The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \nWe maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more. Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $544 million and $417 million, respectively. Approximately 19% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2017 is reasonably expected to remain after 2018. We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract. The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract. In addition, our term drilling contracts are generally subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer. For contracts that we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.\u201d\nRevenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2016 as a result of declines in both activity and pricing. Average revenue per fracturing job and average revenue per other job decreased due to market-related pricing constraints. Average revenue per total job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of a shift in the job mix toward fracturing jobs. The total number of jobs decreased as a result of the downturn in the oil and natural gas industry. Lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $22.0 million related to the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities. There were no similar charges in 2016. In addition, all of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2015.\nOur liquidity as of December 31, 2017 included approximately $201 million in working capital, including $42.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $227 million available under our revolving credit facility.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u2022 $472 million from net proceeds from common stock issuance. \nRevenues, direct operating costs, selling, general and administrative expense and depreciation expense from other operations increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of our oilfield rental business acquired in the SSE merger on April 20, 2017 and our pipe handling components and related technology business acquired in September 2016. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to investments in the oilfield rental business and in oil and natural gas working interests.\nEach of our domestic subsidiaries unconditionally guarantees all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and ours arising under the Credit Agreement, other than (a) Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, (b) domestic subsidiaries that directly or indirectly have no material assets other than equity interests in, or capitalization indebtedness owed by, foreign subsidiaries, and (c) any subsidiary having total assets of less than $1 million. Such guarantees also cover our or any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.\n (7) Represents commitments to purchase major equipment to be delivered in 2018 based on expected delivery dates. \nIn addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.\nSelling, general and administration expense increased in 2017 primarily due to the personnel added as a result of the SSE merger. The merger and integration expenses incurred in 2017 are related to the SSE merger and MS Directional acquisition. Other operating income includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets. Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments. The 2017 period includes a gain of $11.2 million related to the sale of real estate and $8.4 million from the sale of certain oil and gas properties. Interest income increased due to our investment of the proceeds from our stock offering in the first quarter of 2017 prior to utilizing those proceeds to repay SSE indebtedness. Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt outstanding during 2017 compared to 2016.\n\nGenerally, the revenues in our pressure pumping segment are most impacted by our number of fracturing jobs and the size (including whether or not we provide proppant and other materials) of those jobs, which is reflected in our average revenue per fracturing job. We completed 622 fracturing jobs during 2017 compared to 352 fracturing jobs in 2016 and 610 fracturing jobs in 2015. Our average revenue per fracturing job was $1.894 million in 2017 compared to $982,560 in 2016 and $1.118 million in 2015.\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs. Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues. \nOur pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $140 million, of which materials with a total purchase price of approximately $35.9 million were required to be purchased during 2018. In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.\nFor additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.\n (2) A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day. \nManagement Overview - We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment. Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America. Our pressure pumping business operates primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions. We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States, and we also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors in North America and other select markets. In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.\n \u2022 to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis. \nWe review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives ( triggering events\u201d). In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings. The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time. Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate. We estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment. These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management's expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future. Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset's net book value. Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.\nWe concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, with respect to our reporting segments, based on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, our expectations of operating results in future periods and the prevailing commodity prices at the time.\nOn December 12, 2016, we entered into the merger agreement with SSE. On April 20, 2017, pursuant to the merger agreement, a subsidiary of ours was merged with and into SSE, with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of SSE, in exchange for approximately 46.3 million shares of our common stock. Concurrent with the closing of the merger, we repaid all of the outstanding debt of SSE totaling $472 million. Based on the closing price of our common stock on April 20, 2017, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of SSE was approximately $1.5 billion. On April 20, 2017, following the SSE merger, SSE was merged with and into our newly-formed subsidiary SSE LLC, with SSE LLC continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs). The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment. The remaining components of these rigs will be retired. In 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability. In 2016, we retired 19 mechanical rigs but recorded no impairment charge as we had written down mechanical rigs that were still marketed in 2015. In 2015, we identified 24 mechanical rigs and nine non-APEX\u00ae electric rigs that would no longer be marketed. Also, we had 15 additional mechanical rigs that continued to be marketed but were not operating and which we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs. In 2015, we recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remained marketed but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate. Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varied from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varied from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio. Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 3.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 2.50%. A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit. The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is 0.50%.\n\n\nTreasury stock acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nWe pay interest on the 2028 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 2028 Notes will mature on February 1, 2028.

We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.\nThe demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas. The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2017 and 2016 follows:\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. \n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\nProperty and equipment - Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis. No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.\nMS Directional is a leading directional drilling services company in the United States, with operations in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins. MS Directional provides a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, downhole performance motors, directional surveying, measurement while drilling, and wireline steering tools. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the MS Directional business since October 11, 2017.\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days. \n\n\nThe effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:\nDiscussion of our operating income (loss) follows in the Results of Operations\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThrough the SSE merger, we acquired a fleet of 91 drilling rigs, 36 of which we consider to be APEX\u00ae rigs. Additionally, through the SSE merger, we acquired approximately 500,000 horsepower of modern, efficient fracturing equipment located in Oklahoma and Texas. The oilfield rentals business acquired through the SSE merger has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium oilfield rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the SSE businesses since April 20, 2017.\n \u2022 to make capital expenditures for the acquisition, betterment and refurbishment of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, \nDuring the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015. In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses. As a result of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we concluded a triggering event had occurred and deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping. We performed a Step 1 analysis to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments. With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 60%, respectively.\nGenerally, the revenues in our contract drilling segment are most impacted by two primary factors: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day. During 2017, our average number of rigs operating was 136 in the United States and two in Canada, compared to 63 in the United States and two in Canada in 2016, and 120 in the United States and four in Canada in 2015. Our average rig revenue per operating day was $20,620 in 2017, compared to $23,040 in 2016 and $25,560 in 2015.\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nThe decreases in revenues and direct operating costs primarily result from the decrease in the number of rigs operating. Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million. Early termination revenues were approximately $24.6 million in 2016. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 included a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components. There were no similar charges in 2016. Capital expenditures were significantly lower as no new rigs were added to the fleet in 2016 and drilling activity was lower, which required less maintenance capital.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount. In making this determination, we considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in our reporting units, as well as our operating results for 2017 and 2016 and forecasted operating results for the respective succeeding year. Management also considered our overall market capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to purchase approximately $172 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.\nWe, at our option, may redeem the Notes in whole or part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium. Additionally, commencing on November 1, 2027, we, at our option, may redeem the 2028 Notes in whole or part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date.\nWe have also agreed that if obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on any of our subsidiaries' property, then our reimbursement obligations and (to the extent similar obligations would be secured under the Credit Agreement) other obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement and any letters of credit will be equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such liens securing the Credit Agreement.\n (6) See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOn December 22, 2017, significant U.S. tax law changes were enacted ( tax reform\u201d). Tax reform reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax reform, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 of approximately $219 million of tax benefit as a result of tax reform, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report for additional information related to the impact of tax reform.\n \u2022 depreciation, depletion and amortization, \n (1) Revolving credit facility matures on March 27, 2019. \nOur revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services. Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens, and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services. We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Please see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Report.\n2028 Senior Notes - On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries. The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $521 million of which we used $239 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nBased on the results of the Step 1 goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping reporting unit. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our pressure pumping reporting unit.\n2012 Credit Agreement - On September 27, 2012, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( Base Credit Agreement\u201d). The Base Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d) is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.\n (1) The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \n \u2022 to acquire and procure equipment and facilities to support our drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rental and manufacturing operations, and \nThe indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the 2028 Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.\n (5) Interest to be paid on the Series B Notes using 4.27% coupon rate. \nThe effective tax rate increased by approximately 66.0% to 101.8% for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a 66.7% increase related to the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and a 3.6% increase for excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation deductions. These increases were partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in the effective tax rate for acquisitions that resulted in the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new state tax rates at which they are expected to reverse. The lower 2015 effective rate is primarily related to the impact of goodwill impairment charges in 2015 along with an adjustment to our deferred tax liability associated with the 2010 conversion of our Canadian operations to a controlled foreign corporation.\n (9) Excludes $525 million principal repayment of, and interest to be paid on, the 2028 Notes. \nThe respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants. We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time. The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00. The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017. We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.\nRevenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in operating days. Operating days and average rigs operating increased due to a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry and the rigs acquired in the SSE merger. Depreciation, amortization and impairment increased due to the additional SSE assets and due to a $29.0 million impairment from the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability. There was no similar charge in 2016. Average revenue per operating day decreased during 2017 due to a reduction in early termination revenue and the expiration of higher day rate, legacy long-term rig contracts. Early termination revenue in 2017 was $4.9 million, compared to $24.6 million in 2016. Average direct operating costs per operating day increased as a result of a reduction in the proportion of rigs on standby and an increase in rig reactivation expenses. Capital expenditures increased due to upgrading rigs to super-spec capability, building a new rig, higher maintenance capital expenditures and other general property and equipment upgrades.\n \u2022 allowance for doubtful accounts, \nEvents of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to (i) terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii) accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to our insolvency and bankruptcy, such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit.\n (2) Principal repayment of the Series A Notes is required at maturity on October 5, 2020. \nGoodwill - Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be our operating segments. We determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if this is the case, any necessary goodwill impairment is determined using a quantitative impairment test. From time to time, we may perform quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment. If the resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the shortfall.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of the goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit. In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods. The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums. Based on the results of the quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill, as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit.\n \u2022 $60.9 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment, \n (2) The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \n (1) The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $201 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.8 million, compared to negative working capital of $17.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, at December 31, 2016.\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses. \nIncome Taxes\nFor both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Rigs not under term contracts would be subject to pricing in the spot market. Utilization and rates for rigs in the spot market and for the pressure pumping segment were estimated based upon our historical experience in prior downturns. Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in response to improved oil prices.\nDue to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to once again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping. We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments. With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.\n (8) Represents commitments to purchase proppants and chemicals for our pressure pumping business. \nThe demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas. The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand. Customer demand shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs. The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2016 and 2015 follows:\nThe following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nOn July 8, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 2\u201d), which amended the Base Credit Agreement to, among other things, make borrowings under the revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to our and certain of our subsidiaries' eligible equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and unencumbered cash as described in Amendment No. 2. The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $50 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $20 million, in each case outstanding at any time. The maturity date under the Base Credit Agreement was September 27, 2017 for the revolving credit facility; however, Amendment No. 2 extended the maturity date of $357.9 million in revolving credit commitments of certain lenders to March 27, 2019. On January 17, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement, which amended the Credit Agreement by restating the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for the add-back of transaction expenses related to the SSE merger. On January 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with certain lenders under our revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility to approximately $595.8 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The aggregate commitment increase became effective on April 20, 2017 upon the consummation of the SSE merger and the repayment and termination of the SSE credit facility. On April 20, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement which permitted outstanding letters of credit under the SSE credit facility to be deemed to be incurred under our credit facility and increased the amount of the accordion feature of our revolving credit facility to permit aggregate commitments to be increased to an amount not to exceed $700 million (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders). On April 20, 2017, we also entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to both commitment increases) increased to $632 million through September 2017 and to $490 million through March 2019. On October 27, 2017, we entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility increased to $500 million through March 27, 2019.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, our operating income (loss) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nBased on current commodity prices, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and management's expectations of operating results in future periods, we concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to our reporting segments. Our expectations of future operating results were based on the assumption that activity levels in all segments and our other operations will remain relatively stable or improve in response to relatively stable or increasing oil prices.\n \n\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days. \nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, each holder of the 2028 Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder's 2028 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\n\n (1) The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \nThe Series A Notes and Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness. The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that are not required to be guarantors under the Credit Agreement.\n \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015. In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses. As a result of our revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for our contract drilling and pressure pumping services, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2015. In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods. The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling and pressure pumping reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.\nRevenues and direct operating costs increased in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the number and size of fracturing jobs. The total number of jobs increased as a result of the SSE merger and a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry. Average revenue per job increased due to improved pricing and an increase in the size of the jobs. Average direct operating costs per total job increased primarily due to the increase in the size of the jobs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the increase in organizational size and activity as a result of the SSE merger. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to higher maintenance capital expenditures as a result of higher activity and investments to reactivate frac spreads.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.\nOn February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.02 per share to be paid on March 22, 2018 to holders of record as of March 8, 2018. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.\nOn October 11, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of MS Directional. The aggregate consideration paid by us consisted of $69.8 million in cash and approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock. Based on the closing price of our common stock on the closing date of the transaction, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of MS Directional was approximately $257 million.\nWe believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations in 2018, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash flows from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, \nThe indenture pursuant to which the 2028 Notes were issued includes covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens, engage in sale and lease-back transactions or consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of their assets. These covenants are subject to important qualifications and limitations set forth in the indenture.", "item_7_text": "Revenue recognition - Revenues from our contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rental and pipe handling components and related technology activities are recognized as services are performed. All of the wells we drilled in 2017, 2016 and 2015 were drilled under daywork contracts. Revenues from sales of products are recognized upon customer acceptance. Revenues are presented net of any sales tax charged to the customer that we are required to remit to local or state governmental taxing authorities.\nThe following table presents information with respect to our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \u2022 $268 million in net borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and \nImpact of Inflation\nSeries A & B Senior Notes - On October 5, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4.97% Series A Senior Notes due October 5, 2020 (the Series A Notes\u201d) in a private placement. The Series A Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.97% per annum. We pay interest on the Series A Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year. The Series A Notes will mature on October 5, 2020.\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-09, Compensation-Stock Compensation\u201d (ASU 2016-09). The new standard was effective for us on January 1, 2017. Among other provisions, the new standard requires that excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies that arise upon vesting or exercise of share-based payments be recognized as income tax benefits and expenses in the income statement. Previously, such amounts were recorded to additional paid-in-capital. This aspect of the new guidance was required to be adopted prospectively. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 includes approximately $12 million of excess tax benefits from share-based compensation awards that vested or were exercised during the period.\n\n \u2022 $301 million from operating activities, \nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an accounting standards update to eliminate Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. An entity will now perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, but the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We adopted this update in 2017. Prior to adoption we first determined whether it was more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit was less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if so, the resulting goodwill impairment was determined using a two-step quantitative impairment test. The first step of the quantitative testing was to compare the fair value of an entity's reporting units to the respective carrying value of those reporting units. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, the second step of the quantitative testing was performed whereby the fair value of the reporting unit was allocated to its identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities, with any remaining fair value representing the fair value of goodwill. If this resulting fair value of goodwill was less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss was recognized in the amount of such shortfall.\nDuring 2017, we had significant merger and acquisition activity. Based on this activity, we evaluated our overall state deferred tax rate, resulting in a slightly increased rate. We remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future and recorded additional taxes of approximately $11 million, resulting in the above impact to the 2017 effective tax rate.\nInflation has not had a significant impact on our operations during the three years ended December 31, 2017. We believe that inflation will not have a significant near-term impact on our financial position.\nAdjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) is not defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) plus net interest expense, income tax expense (benefit) and depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense (including impairment of goodwill). We present Adjusted EBITDA because we believe it provides to both management and investors additional information with respect to the performance of our fundamental business activities and a comparison of the results of our operations from period to period and against our peers without regard to our financing methods or capital structure. We exclude the items listed above from net income (loss) in arriving at Adjusted EBITDA because these amounts can vary substantially from company to company within our industry depending upon accounting methods and book values of assets, capital structures and the method by which the assets were acquired. Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an alternative to the U.S. GAAP measure of net income (loss). Our computations of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as other similarly titled measures of other companies. Set forth below is a reconciliation of the non-U.S. GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA to the U.S. GAAP financial measure of net income (loss).\nThe following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:\nWe have addressed our customers' needs for drilling horizontal wells in shale and other unconventional resource plays by expanding our areas of operation and improving the capabilities of our drilling fleet during the last several years. As of December 31, 2017, our rig fleet included 199 APEX\u00ae rigs.\nIn connection with the development of horizontal shale and other unconventional resource plays, in the last five years we have added equipment to perform service intensive fracturing jobs. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1.6 million horsepower in our pressure pumping fleet. In recent years, the industry-wide addition of new pressure pumping equipment to the marketplace and lower oil and natural gas prices have led to an excess supply of pressure pumping equipment in North America.\nThe Credit Agreement limits our ability to make investments in foreign subsidiaries or joint ventures such that, if the book value of all such investments since September 27, 2012 is above 20% of our total consolidated book value of the assets on a pro forma basis, we will not be able to make such investment. The Credit Agreement also restricts our ability to pay dividends and make equity repurchases, subject to certain exceptions, including an exception allowing such restricted payments if before and immediately after giving effect to such restricted payment, the Pro Forma Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) is at least 1.50 to 1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement requires that, if our consolidated cash balance, subject to certain exclusions, is more than $100 million at the end of the day on which a borrowing is made, we can only use the proceeds from such borrowing to fund acquisitions, capital expenditures and the repurchase of indebtedness, and if such proceeds are not used in such manner within three business days, we must repay such unused proceeds on the fourth business day following such borrowings.\n\nCommitments and Contingencies - As of December 31, 2017, we maintained letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $59.5 million for the benefit of various insurance companies as collateral for retrospective premiums and retained losses which could become payable under the terms of the underlying insurance contracts. These letters of credit expire annually at various times during the year and are typically renewed. As of December 31, 2017, no amounts had been drawn under the letters of credit.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nOur revenue, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas and expectations about future prices. For many years, oil and natural gas prices and markets have been extremely volatile. Prices are affected by many factors beyond our control. Please see Risk Factors - We are Dependent on the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Market Prices for Oil and Natural Gas. Declines in Customers' Operating and Capital Expenditures and in Oil and Natural Gas Prices May Adversely Affect Our Operating Results\u201d in Item 1A of this Report. The closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014. Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016. Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016. Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017. In response to improved prices, U.S. rig counts have increased, and we believe they will continue to increase throughout 2018 if prices for these commodities remain at or above current levels.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFor a discussion of recently issued accounting standards, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.\nRevenues from other operations decreased as a result of lower production and lower oil prices which resulted in lower revenues from our oil and natural gas working interests. Direct operating costs include a reduction in production taxes due to lower revenues. Selling, general and administrative expense increased from 2015 as the 2016 results include costs related to our drilling technology service business which was acquired in September 2016. Depreciation, depletion and impairment expense in 2016 includes approximately $2.8 million of oil and natural gas property impairments as compared to approximately $10.7 million of oil and natural gas property impairments in 2015.\nTax reform reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a new limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes. Based on a reduced US federal corporate tax rate of 21% from tax reform, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities at the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future. Due to the limited time to consider tax reform and its various interpretations, we are still analyzing and refining our calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances or give rise to new deferred tax amounts, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount, in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118, of approximately $219 million of tax benefit, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations resulting in the above impact to our 2017 effective tax rate. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report for additional information related to the impact of tax reform.\n\nThe Series A Notes and Series B Notes are prepayable at our option, in whole or in part, provided that in the case of a partial prepayment, prepayment must be in an amount not less than 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding, at any time and from time to time at 100% of the principal amount prepaid, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the prepayment date, plus a make-whole\u201d premium as specified in the note purchase agreements. We must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of any change of control. In addition, we must offer to prepay the notes upon the occurrence of certain asset dispositions if the proceeds therefrom are not timely reinvested in productive assets. If any offer to prepay is accepted, the purchase price of each prepaid note is 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the prepayment date.\nOur rig count in the United States declined significantly during the industry downturn that began in late 2014, but has improved since the second quarter of 2016. Our average rig count in the United States was 159 rigs for both the third and fourth quarter of 2017, with the third quarter of 2017 being the first quarter with a full quarter contribution from the rigs acquired in the SSE merger. Our rig count in the United States at December 31, 2017 was 163 rigs. Term contracts have supported our operating rig count during the last three years. Based on contracts currently in place, we expect an average of 96 rigs operating under term contracts during the first quarter of 2018 and an average of 67 rigs operating under term contracts throughout 2018.\nCommon Stock Offering - On January 27, 2017, we completed an offering of 18.2 million shares of our common stock and raised net proceeds of $472 million. We used the net proceeds of the offering to repay of SSE's outstanding indebtedness of approximately $472 million.\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs. Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues. \nWe paid cash dividends during the year ended December 31, 2017 as follows:\nWe expect oil and natural gas prices to continue to be volatile and to affect our financial condition, operations and ability to access sources of capital. Higher oil and natural gas prices do not necessarily result in increased activity because demand for our services is generally driven by our customers' expectations of future oil and natural gas prices. A decline in demand for oil and natural gas, prolonged low oil or natural gas prices or expectations of decreases in oil and natural gas prices, would likely result in reduced capital expenditures by our customers and decreased demand for our services, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and cash flows. Even during periods of high prices for oil and natural gas, companies exploring for oil and natural gas may cancel or curtail programs, or reduce their levels of capital expenditures for exploration and production for a variety of reasons, which could reduce demand for our services.\n (3) Interest to be paid on the Series A Notes using 4.97% coupon rate. \n\nThe improvement in demand for our services and the income tax rate change resulted in consolidated net income of $5.9 million for 2017 compared to a consolidated net loss of $319 million for 2016 and a consolidated net loss of $294 million for 2015.\n\nWe also periodically evaluate our pressure pumping assets, and in 2015, we recorded a charge of $22.0 million for the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and certain closed facilities. There were no similar charges in 2017 or 2016.\nContractual Obligations\nResults of Operations\n\nOn June 14, 2012, we completed the issuance and sale of $300 million in aggregate principal amounts of our 4.27% Series B Senior Notes due June 14, 2022 (the Series B Notes\u201d) in a private placement. The Series B Notes bear interest at a rate of 4.27% per annum. We pay interest on the Series B Notes on April 5 and October 5 of each year. The Series B Notes will mature on June 14, 2022.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had $268 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 5.71%. We had $4.6 million in letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility at December 31, 2017 and, as a result, had available borrowing capacity of $227 million at that date. As of February 16, 2018, we had repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, had approximately $118,000 of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility, and had borrowing capacity of $499.9 million.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, our operating revenues consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\n\nThe closing price of oil was as high as $107.95 per barrel in June 2014. Prices began to fall in the third quarter of 2014 and reached a twelve-year low of $26.19 in February 2016. Oil and natural gas prices have modestly recovered from the lows experienced in the first quarter of 2016. Oil prices averaged $55.37 per barrel in the fourth quarter of 2017.\nDuring 2017, we used $502 million, net of cash acquired, for the acquisitions of SSE and MS Directional, $16.3 million to pay dividends on our common stock, $6.8 million to acquire shares of our common stock and $567 million:\nWe record deferred federal income taxes based primarily on the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be settled. As a result of fully recognizing the benefit of our deferred income taxes, we incur deferred income tax expense as these benefits are utilized. We recognized a deferred tax benefit of approximately $330 million in 2017, $152 million in 2016 and $100 million in 2015.\n\n\nLower selling, general and administrative expense reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions. Other operating (income) expense, net includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets related to corporate strategy decisions of the executive management group. Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments. Interest expense increased primarily due to lower capitalized interest, as we reduced our level of capital expenditures in 2016. In addition, we repaid the entire outstanding principal amount of our bank term loans. As a result, we expensed $1.4 million of previously unamortized debt issuance costs in 2016 related to these bank term loans.\nVolatility of Oil and Natural Gas Prices and its Impact on Operations and Financial Condition\nOn September 6, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a stock buyback program that authorizes purchase of up to $200 million of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. All purchases executed to date have been through open market transactions. Purchases under the program are made at management's discretion, at prevailing prices, subject to market conditions and other factors. Purchases may be made at any time without prior notice. Shares of stock purchased under the plan are held as treasury shares. There is no expiration date associated with the buyback program. As of December 31, 2017, we had remaining authorization to purchase approximately $187 million of our outstanding common stock under the 2013 stock buyback program.\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements at December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 goodwill and long-lived asset impairments, and \nRecent Developments - On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 3.95% Senior Notes due 2028 initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries. We used $239 million of the net proceeds from the sale to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nKey estimates used by management include:\nAdjusted EBITDA\nActivity levels in our pressure pumping business also improved during 2017, especially in the Permian Basin. We reactivated two frac spreads during the third quarter, and one additional frac spread during the fourth quarter. With the addition of these three frac spreads, we exited 2017 with 23 active frac spreads or approximately 1.25 million active fracturing horsepower.\n (4) Principal repayment of the Series B Notes is required at maturity on June 14, 2022. \n\nPursuant to a Continuing Guaranty dated as of March 16, 2015 (the Continuing Guaranty\u201d), our payment obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement are jointly and severally guaranteed as to payment and not as to collection by our subsidiaries that from time to time guarantee payment under the Credit Agreement.\nReimbursements for the purchase of supplies, equipment, personnel services, shipping and other services that are provided at the request of our customers are recorded as revenue when incurred. The related costs are recorded as operating expense when incurred.\nEvents of default under the note purchase agreements include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, a cross default event, a judgment in excess of a threshold event, the guaranty agreement ceasing to be enforceable, the occurrence of certain ERISA events, a change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default under the note purchase agreements occurs and is continuing, then holders of a majority in principal amount of the respective notes have the right to declare all the notes then-outstanding to be immediately due and payable. In addition, if we default in payments on any note, then until such defaults are cured, the holder thereof may declare all the notes held by it pursuant to the note purchase agreement to be immediately due and payable.\n\nThe Credit Agreement requires compliance with two financial covenants. We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 40%. The Credit Agreement generally defines the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 3.00 to 1.00. The Credit Agreement generally defines the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA\u201d) of the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017.\nUnder the terms of the Reimbursement Agreement, we will reimburse Scotiabank on demand for any amounts that Scotiabank has disbursed under any letters of credit. Fees, charges and other reasonable expenses for the issuance of letters of credit are payable by us at the time of issuance at such rates and amounts as are in accordance with Scotiabank's prevailing practice. We are obligated to pay to Scotiabank interest on all amounts not paid on the date of demand or when otherwise due at the LIBOR rate plus 2.25% per annum, calculated daily and payable monthly, in arrears, on the basis of a calendar year for the actual number of days elapsed, with interest on overdue interest at the same rate as on the reimbursement amounts.\n2015 Reimbursement Agreement - On March 16, 2015, we entered into a Reimbursement Agreement (the Reimbursement Agreement\u201d) with The Bank of Nova Scotia ( Scotiabank\u201d), pursuant to which we may from time to time request that Scotiabank issue an unspecified amount of letters of credit. As of December 31, 2017, we had $54.9 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Reimbursement Agreement.\nDuring 2017, our sources of cash flow included:\nWe acquired shares of stock from directors in 2017 and 2016 and from employees during 2017, 2016 and 2015 that are accounted for as treasury stock. Certain of these shares were acquired to satisfy the exercise price in connection with the exercise of stock options. The remainder of these shares was acquired to satisfy payroll withholding obligations upon the settlement of performance unit awards and the vesting of restricted stock. These shares were acquired at fair market value. These acquisitions were made pursuant to the terms of the Patterson-UTI Energy, Inc. 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan and not pursuant to the stock buyback program.\nThe 2028 Notes are our senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally with all of our other existing and future senior unsecured debt and will rank senior in right of payment to all of our other future subordinated debt. The 2028 Notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In addition, the 2028 Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities (including trade payables) of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 2028 Notes. The guarantors' guarantees of the 2028 Notes (the Guarantees\u201d) will rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors' future unsecured senior debt and senior in right of payment to all of the guarantors' future subordinated debt. The Guarantees will be effectively subordinated to any of the guarantors' future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt. In the future, the Guarantees may be released and terminated under certain circumstances.\nOur directional drilling segment originated with the October 11, 2017 acquisition of MS Directional, and consequently we have no results for the prior year in this segment.\nPrior to tax reform, we had elected to permanently reinvest unremitted earnings in Canada effective January 1, 2010, and we intended to do so for the foreseeable future. As a result, no deferred U.S. federal or state income taxes had been provided on such unremitted foreign earnings. With the enactment of tax reform, there is a new territorial tax system that provides for a 100% dividends received deduction on future earnings, if remitted. However, we will need to continue to evaluate our reinvestment intentions on future earnings and any other residual basis differences in order to determine whether we can continue to assert indefinite reinvestment or whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes that would be due on future earnings if remitted, such as foreign withholding taxes or state and local taxes. We will also need to determine whether we will be required to provide for additional taxes on any other outside basis differences in our foreign operations. Due to the limited time to consider these provisions, we are still evaluating how tax reform will affect our existing accounting position to indefinitely reinvest unremitted foreign earnings. We will continue to assert permanent reinvestment with respect to future unremitted earnings and have not recorded any deferred federal or state income taxes that would be provided on future unremitted earnings. We will finalize our intentions on whether we will permanently reinvest our foreign unremitted earnings within the measurement period provided under SAB 118.\nQuarterly average oil prices and our quarterly average number of rigs operating in the United States for 2015, 2016 and 2017 are as follows:\n (2) The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \nWe maintain a backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which we define as contracts with a fixed term of six months or more. Our contract drilling backlog as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $544 million and $417 million, respectively. Approximately 19% of the total contract drilling backlog at December 31, 2017 is reasonably expected to remain after 2018. We generally calculate our backlog by multiplying the dayrate under our term drilling contracts by the number of days remaining under the contract. The calculation does not include any revenues related to other fees such as for mobilization, demobilization and customer reimbursables, nor does it include potential reductions in rates for unscheduled standby or during periods in which the rig is moving or incurring maintenance and repair time in excess of what is permitted under the drilling contract. In addition, our term drilling contracts are generally subject to termination by the customer on short notice and provide for an early termination payment to us in the event that the contract is terminated by the customer. For contracts that we have received an early termination notice, our backlog calculation includes the early termination rate, instead of the dayrate, for the period we expect to receive the lower rate. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - Our Current Backlog of Contract Drilling Revenue May Continue to Decline and May Not Ultimately Be Realized, as Fixed-Term Contracts May in Certain Instances Be Terminated Without an Early Termination Payment.\u201d\nRevenues and direct operating costs decreased in 2016 as a result of declines in both activity and pricing. Average revenue per fracturing job and average revenue per other job decreased due to market-related pricing constraints. Average revenue per total job and average direct operating costs per total job increased as a result of a shift in the job mix toward fracturing jobs. The total number of jobs decreased as a result of the downturn in the oil and natural gas industry. Lower selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 reflects lower personnel costs due to headcount reductions. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 includes a charge of $22.0 million related to the write-down of pressure pumping equipment and closed facilities. There were no similar charges in 2016. In addition, all of the goodwill associated with our pressure pumping business was impaired during 2015.\nOur liquidity as of December 31, 2017 included approximately $201 million in working capital, including $42.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $227 million available under our revolving credit facility.\nCritical Accounting Policies\n \u2022 $472 million from net proceeds from common stock issuance. \nRevenues, direct operating costs, selling, general and administrative expense and depreciation expense from other operations increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of our oilfield rental business acquired in the SSE merger on April 20, 2017 and our pipe handling components and related technology business acquired in September 2016. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to investments in the oilfield rental business and in oil and natural gas working interests.\nEach of our domestic subsidiaries unconditionally guarantees all existing and future indebtedness and liabilities of the other guarantors and ours arising under the Credit Agreement, other than (a) Ambar Lone Star Fluid Services LLC, (b) domestic subsidiaries that directly or indirectly have no material assets other than equity interests in, or capitalization indebtedness owed by, foreign subsidiaries, and (c) any subsidiary having total assets of less than $1 million. Such guarantees also cover our or any of our subsidiaries arising under any interest rate swap contract with any person while such person is a lender or an affiliate of a lender under the Credit Agreement.\n (7) Represents commitments to purchase major equipment to be delivered in 2018 based on expected delivery dates. \nIn addition to established accounting policies, our consolidated financial statements are impacted by certain estimates and assumptions made by management. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies pertaining to property and equipment, goodwill, revenue recognition, the use of estimates and oil and natural gas properties.\nSelling, general and administration expense increased in 2017 primarily due to the personnel added as a result of the SSE merger. The merger and integration expenses incurred in 2017 are related to the SSE merger and MS Directional acquisition. Other operating income includes net gains associated with the disposal of assets. Accordingly, the related gains or losses have been excluded from the results of specific segments. The 2017 period includes a gain of $11.2 million related to the sale of real estate and $8.4 million from the sale of certain oil and gas properties. Interest income increased due to our investment of the proceeds from our stock offering in the first quarter of 2017 prior to utilizing those proceeds to repay SSE indebtedness. Interest expense decreased primarily due to lower debt outstanding during 2017 compared to 2016.\n\nGenerally, the revenues in our pressure pumping segment are most impacted by our number of fracturing jobs and the size (including whether or not we provide proppant and other materials) of those jobs, which is reflected in our average revenue per fracturing job. We completed 622 fracturing jobs during 2017 compared to 352 fracturing jobs in 2016 and 610 fracturing jobs in 2015. Our average revenue per fracturing job was $1.894 million in 2017 compared to $982,560 in 2016 and $1.118 million in 2015.\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per total job is defined as margin divided by total jobs. Margin as a percentage of revenues is defined as margin divided by revenues. \nOur pressure pumping business has entered into agreements to purchase minimum quantities of proppants and chemicals from certain vendors. As of December 31, 2017, the remaining obligation under these agreements was approximately $140 million, of which materials with a total purchase price of approximately $35.9 million were required to be purchased during 2018. In the event that the required minimum quantities are not purchased during any contract year, we could be required to make a liquidated damages payment to the respective vendor for any shortfall.\nFor additional information on our accounting policies, see Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included as a part of Item 8 of this Report.\n (2) A rig is considered to be operating if it is earning revenue pursuant to a contract on a given day. \nManagement Overview - We are a Houston, Texas-based oilfield services company that primarily owns and operates in the United States one of the largest fleets of land-based drilling rigs and a large fleet of pressure pumping equipment. Our contract drilling business operates in the continental United States and western Canada, and we are pursuing contract drilling opportunities outside of North America. Our pressure pumping business operates primarily in Texas and the Mid-Continent and Appalachian regions. We also provide a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins in the United States. We have other operations through which we provide oilfield rental tools in select markets in the United States, and we also manufacture and sell pipe handling components and related technology to drilling contractors in North America and other select markets. In addition, we own and invest, as a non-operating working interest owner, in oil and natural gas assets that are primarily located in Texas and New Mexico.\n \u2022 to fund investments in oil and natural gas properties on a non-operating working interest basis. \nWe review our long-lived assets, including property and equipment, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of certain assets may not be recovered over their estimated remaining useful lives ( triggering events\u201d). In connection with this review, assets are grouped at the lowest level at which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of other asset groupings. The cyclical nature of our industry has resulted in fluctuations in rig utilization over periods of time. Management believes that the contract drilling industry will continue to be cyclical and rig utilization will continue to fluctuate. We estimate future cash flows over the life of the respective assets or asset groupings in our assessment of impairment. These estimates of cash flows are based on historical cyclical trends in the industry as well as management's expectations regarding the continuation of these trends in the future. Provisions for asset impairment are charged against income when estimated future cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, are less than the asset's net book value. Any provision for impairment is measured at fair value.\nWe concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2016, with respect to our reporting segments, based on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, our expectations of operating results in future periods and the prevailing commodity prices at the time.\nOn December 12, 2016, we entered into the merger agreement with SSE. On April 20, 2017, pursuant to the merger agreement, a subsidiary of ours was merged with and into SSE, with SSE continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries. Pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of SSE, in exchange for approximately 46.3 million shares of our common stock. Concurrent with the closing of the merger, we repaid all of the outstanding debt of SSE totaling $472 million. Based on the closing price of our common stock on April 20, 2017, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of SSE was approximately $1.5 billion. On April 20, 2017, following the SSE merger, SSE was merged with and into our newly-formed subsidiary SSE LLC, with SSE LLC continuing as the surviving entity and one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.\nOn a periodic basis, we evaluate our fleet of drilling rigs for marketability based on the condition of inactive rigs, expenditures that would be necessary to bring them to working condition and the expected demand for drilling services by rig type (such as drilling conventional, vertical wells versus drilling longer, horizontal wells using higher specification rigs). The components comprising rigs that will no longer be marketed are evaluated, and those components with continuing utility to our other marketed rigs are transferred to other rigs or to our yards to be used as spare equipment. The remaining components of these rigs will be retired. In 2017, we recorded an impairment charge of $29.0 million for the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability. In 2016, we retired 19 mechanical rigs but recorded no impairment charge as we had written down mechanical rigs that were still marketed in 2015. In 2015, we identified 24 mechanical rigs and nine non-APEX\u00ae electric rigs that would no longer be marketed. Also, we had 15 additional mechanical rigs that continued to be marketed but were not operating and which we had lower expectations with respect to utilization of these rigs due to the industry shift to higher specification drilling rigs. In 2015, we recorded a charge of $131 million related to the retirement of the 33 rigs, the 15 mechanical rigs that remained marketed but were not operating, and the write-down of excess spare rig components to their realizable values.\nLoans under the Credit Agreement bear interest by reference, at our election, to the LIBOR rate or base rate, provided, that swing line loans bear interest by reference only to the base rate. Until September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varied from 2.75% to 3.25% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varied from 1.75% to 2.25%, in each case determined based upon our debt to capitalization ratio. Beginning September 27, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans varies from 3.25% to 3.75% and the applicable margin on base rate loans varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case determined based on our excess availability under the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017, the applicable margin on LIBOR rate loans was 3.50% and the applicable margin on base rate loans was 2.50%. A letter of credit fee is payable by us equal to the applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans times the daily amount available to be drawn under outstanding letters of credit. The commitment fee rate payable to the lenders for the unused portion of the revolving credit facility is 0.50%.\n\n\nTreasury stock acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nWe pay interest on the 2028 Notes on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 2028 Notes will mature on February 1, 2028. The 2028 Notes bear interest at a rate of 3.95% per annum.\n \u2022 reserves for self-insured levels of insurance coverage. \nTrading and Investing - We have not engaged in trading activities that include high-risk securities, such as derivatives and non-exchange traded contracts. We invest cash primarily in highly liquid, short-term investments such as overnight deposits and money market accounts.\nThe demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas. The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2017 and 2016 follows:\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. \n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, depletion and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. \n\nProperty and equipment - Property and equipment, including betterments which extend the useful life of the asset, are stated at cost. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when incurred. We provide for the depreciation of our property and equipment using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives. Our method of depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle; we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight-line basis. No provision for salvage value is considered in determining depreciation of our property and equipment.\nMS Directional is a leading directional drilling services company in the United States, with operations in most major producing onshore oil and gas basins. MS Directional provides a comprehensive suite of directional drilling services, including directional drilling, downhole performance motors, directional surveying, measurement while drilling, and wireline steering tools. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the MS Directional business since October 11, 2017.\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days. \n\n\nThe effective tax rate is a result of a federal rate of 35.0% adjusted as follows:\nDiscussion of our operating income (loss) follows in the Results of Operations\u201d section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThrough the SSE merger, we acquired a fleet of 91 drilling rigs, 36 of which we consider to be APEX\u00ae rigs. Additionally, through the SSE merger, we acquired approximately 500,000 horsepower of modern, efficient fracturing equipment located in Oklahoma and Texas. The oilfield rentals business acquired through the SSE merger has a modern, well-maintained fleet of premium oilfield rental tools, and provides specialized services for land-based oil and natural gas drilling, completion and workover activities. Operational and financial data in the discussion and analysis below includes the results of operations of the SSE businesses since April 20, 2017.\n \u2022 to make capital expenditures for the acquisition, betterment and refurbishment of drilling rigs and pressure pumping equipment, \nDuring the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015. In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses. As a result of these revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for contract drilling and pressure pumping services during the third quarter of 2015, we concluded a triggering event had occurred and deemed it necessary to assess the recoverability of long-lived asset groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping. We performed a Step 1 analysis to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments. With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 60%, respectively.\nGenerally, the revenues in our contract drilling segment are most impacted by two primary factors: our average number of rigs operating and our average revenue per operating day. During 2017, our average number of rigs operating was 136 in the United States and two in Canada, compared to 63 in the United States and two in Canada in 2016, and 120 in the United States and four in Canada in 2015. Our average rig revenue per operating day was $20,620 in 2017, compared to $23,040 in 2016 and $25,560 in 2015.\nUse of estimates - The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from such estimates.\nThe decreases in revenues and direct operating costs primarily result from the decrease in the number of rigs operating. Average revenue per operating day and average margin per operating day were higher in 2015 primarily due to higher average dayrates and early termination revenues of approximately $69.4 million. Early termination revenues were approximately $24.6 million in 2016. Depreciation, amortization and impairment expense for 2015 included a charge of $131 million related to the write-down of drilling equipment primarily related to mechanical rigs and spare mechanical rig components. There were no similar charges in 2016. Capital expenditures were significantly lower as no new rigs were added to the fleet in 2016 and drilling activity was lower, which required less maintenance capital.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we determined based on an assessment of qualitative factors that it was more likely than not that the fair values of our reporting units were greater than the respective carrying amount. In making this determination, we considered the current and expected levels of commodity prices for oil and natural gas, which influence the overall level of business activity in our reporting units, as well as our operating results for 2017 and 2016 and forecasted operating results for the respective succeeding year. Management also considered our overall market capitalization at December 31, 2017 and 2016.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had commitments to purchase approximately $172 million of major equipment for our drilling and pressure pumping businesses.\nWe, at our option, may redeem the Notes in whole or part, at any time or from time to time at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of such 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date, plus a make-whole premium. Additionally, commencing on November 1, 2027, we, at our option, may redeem the 2028 Notes in whole or part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2028 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on those 2028 Notes to the redemption date.\nWe have also agreed that if obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by liens on any of our subsidiaries' property, then our reimbursement obligations and (to the extent similar obligations would be secured under the Credit Agreement) other obligations under the Reimbursement Agreement and any letters of credit will be equally and ratably secured by all property subject to such liens securing the Credit Agreement.\n (6) See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. \nOn December 22, 2017, significant U.S. tax law changes were enacted ( tax reform\u201d). Tax reform reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on foreign earnings that were previously tax deferred, creates new taxes on future foreign earnings, places a limitation on the tax deductibility of interest expense, accelerates the expensing of certain business assets, and reduces the amount of executive pay that will be tax deductible, among other changes. At December 31, 2017, we had not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the tax reform, however, in certain cases, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. For the items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate, we recognized a provisional amount in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 118 of approximately $219 million of tax benefit as a result of tax reform, which is included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations. See Note 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this Report for additional information related to the impact of tax reform.\n \u2022 depreciation, depletion and amortization, \n (1) Revolving credit facility matures on March 27, 2019. \nOur revenues, profitability and cash flows are highly dependent upon prevailing prices for oil and natural gas. During periods of improved commodity prices, the capital spending budgets of oil and natural gas operators tend to expand, which generally results in increased demand for our services. Conversely, in periods when these commodity prices deteriorate, the demand for our services generally weakens, and we experience downward pressure on pricing for our services. We are also highly impacted by operational risks, competition, the availability of excess equipment, labor issues, weather and various other factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Please see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A of this Report.\n2028 Senior Notes - On January 19, 2018, we completed an offering of $525 million aggregate principal amount of our 2028 Notes initially guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by certain of our subsidiaries. The net proceeds before offering expenses were approximately $521 million of which we used $239 million to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes.\nBased on the results of the Step 1 goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2015, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 15%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit; however, impairment was indicated in our pressure pumping reporting unit. In the third quarter of 2015, we recognized an impairment charge of $125 million associated with the impairment of all of the goodwill in our pressure pumping reporting unit.\n2012 Credit Agreement - On September 27, 2012, we entered into a Credit Agreement ( Base Credit Agreement\u201d). The Base Credit Agreement (as amended, the Credit Agreement\u201d) is a committed senior unsecured credit facility that includes a revolving credit facility.\n (1) The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \n \u2022 to acquire and procure equipment and facilities to support our drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rental and manufacturing operations, and \nThe indenture also provides for events of default which, if any of them occurs, would permit or require the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued interest, if any, on the 2028 Notes to become or to be declared due and payable.\n (5) Interest to be paid on the Series B Notes using 4.27% coupon rate. \nThe effective tax rate increased by approximately 66.0% to 101.8% for 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to a 66.7% increase related to the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017 and a 3.6% increase for excess tax benefits from employee stock compensation deductions. These increases were partially offset by a 3.3% decrease in the effective tax rate for acquisitions that resulted in the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new state tax rates at which they are expected to reverse. The lower 2015 effective rate is primarily related to the impact of goodwill impairment charges in 2015 along with an adjustment to our deferred tax liability associated with the 2010 conversion of our Canadian operations to a controlled foreign corporation.\n (9) Excludes $525 million principal repayment of, and interest to be paid on, the 2028 Notes. \nThe respective note purchase agreements require compliance with two financial covenants. We must not permit our debt to capitalization ratio to exceed 50% at any time. The note purchase agreements generally define the debt to capitalization ratio as the ratio of (a) total borrowed money indebtedness to (b) the sum of such indebtedness plus consolidated net worth, with consolidated net worth determined as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter. We also must not permit our interest coverage ratio as of the last day of a fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.00. The note purchase agreements generally define the interest coverage ratio as the ratio of EBITDA for the four prior fiscal quarters to interest charges for the same period. We were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2017. We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.\nRevenues and direct operating costs increased primarily due to an increase in operating days. Operating days and average rigs operating increased due to a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry and the rigs acquired in the SSE merger. Depreciation, amortization and impairment increased due to the additional SSE assets and due to a $29.0 million impairment from the write-down of drilling equipment with no continuing utility as a result of the upgrade of certain rigs to super-spec capability. There was no similar charge in 2016. Average revenue per operating day decreased during 2017 due to a reduction in early termination revenue and the expiration of higher day rate, legacy long-term rig contracts. Early termination revenue in 2017 was $4.9 million, compared to $24.6 million in 2016. Average direct operating costs per operating day increased as a result of a reduction in the proportion of rigs on standby and an increase in rig reactivation expenses. Capital expenditures increased due to upgrading rigs to super-spec capability, building a new rig, higher maintenance capital expenditures and other general property and equipment upgrades.\n \u2022 allowance for doubtful accounts, \nEvents of default under the Credit Agreement include failure to pay principal or interest when due, failure to comply with the financial and operational covenants, as well as a cross default event, loan document enforceability event, change of control event and bankruptcy and other insolvency events. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, then a majority of the lenders have the right, among others, to (i) terminate the commitments under the Credit Agreement, (ii) accelerate and require us to repay all the outstanding amounts owed under any loan document (provided that in limited circumstances with respect to our insolvency and bankruptcy, such acceleration is automatic), and (iii) require us to cash collateralize any outstanding letters of credit.\n (2) Principal repayment of the Series A Notes is required at maturity on October 5, 2020. \nGoodwill - Goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful economic life and is not amortized. Goodwill is evaluated at least annually as of December 31, or when circumstances require, to determine if the fair value of recorded goodwill has decreased below its carrying value. For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level. Our reporting units for impairment testing have been determined to be our operating segments. We determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value after considering qualitative, market and other factors, and if this is the case, any necessary goodwill impairment is determined using a quantitative impairment test. From time to time, we may perform quantitative testing for goodwill impairment in lieu of performing the qualitative assessment. If the resulting fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount of the shortfall.\nIn connection with our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of December 31, 2015, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of the goodwill in our contract drilling reporting unit. In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of the contract drilling reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods. The estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling reporting unit, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums. Based on the results of the quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill, as of December 31, 2015, the fair value of our contract drilling reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 16%, and we concluded that no impairment was indicated in our contract drilling reporting unit.\n \u2022 $60.9 million in proceeds from the disposal of property and equipment, \n (2) The average natural gas price represents the average monthly Henry Hub Spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \n (1) The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \nAs of December 31, 2017, we had working capital of $201 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $42.8 million, compared to negative working capital of $17.9 million, including cash and cash equivalents of $35.2 million, at December 31, 2016.\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation and amortization and selling, general and administrative expenses. \nIncome Taxes\nFor both of the assessments performed in 2015, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling segment included the backlog of commitments for contract drilling revenues under term contracts, which was approximately $801 million and $710 million at September 30, 2015 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Rigs not under term contracts would be subject to pricing in the spot market. Utilization and rates for rigs in the spot market and for the pressure pumping segment were estimated based upon our historical experience in prior downturns. Also, the expected cash flows for the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments were based on the assumption that activity levels in both segments would begin to recover in the first quarter of 2017 in response to improved oil prices.\nDue to the continued deterioration of crude oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2015, we deemed it necessary to once again assess the recoverability of long-lived assets groups for both contract drilling and pressure pumping. We performed a Step 1 analysis as required by ASC 360-10-35 to assess the recoverability of long-lived assets within our contract drilling and pressure pumping segments. With respect to these assets, future cash flows were estimated over the expected remaining life of the assets, and we determined that, on an undiscounted basis, expected cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the long-lived assets, and no impairment was indicated. Expected cash flows, on an undiscounted basis, exceeded the carrying values of the long-lived assets within the contract drilling and pressure pumping segments by approximately 120% and 100%, respectively.\n (8) Represents commitments to purchase proppants and chemicals for our pressure pumping business. \nThe demand for our contract drilling services is impacted by the market price of oil and natural gas. The reactivation and construction of new land drilling rigs in the United States in recent years contributed to an excess capacity of land drilling rigs compared to demand. Customer demand shifted away from mechanically powered drilling rigs to electric powered drilling rigs, reducing the utilization rates of our mechanically powered drilling rigs. The average market price of oil and natural gas for each of the fiscal quarters and full year in 2016 and 2015 follows:\nThe following tables summarize results of operations by business segment for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:\nOn July 8, 2016, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Credit Agreement ( Amendment No. 2\u201d), which amended the Base Credit Agreement to, among other things, make borrowings under the revolving credit facility subject to a borrowing base calculated by reference to our and certain of our subsidiaries' eligible equipment, inventory, accounts receivable and unencumbered cash as described in Amendment No. 2. The revolving credit facility contains a letter of credit facility that is limited to $50 million and a swing line facility that is limited to $20 million, in each case outstanding at any time. The maturity date under the Base Credit Agreement was September 27, 2017 for the revolving credit facility; however, Amendment No. 2 extended the maturity date of $357.9 million in revolving credit commitments of certain lenders to March 27, 2019. On January 17, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 3 to Credit Agreement, which amended the Credit Agreement by restating the definition of Consolidated EBITDA to provide for the add-back of transaction expenses related to the SSE merger. On January 24, 2017, we entered into an agreement with certain lenders under our revolving credit facility to increase the aggregate commitments under our revolving credit facility to approximately $595.8 million, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions. The aggregate commitment increase became effective on April 20, 2017 upon the consummation of the SSE merger and the repayment and termination of the SSE credit facility. On April 20, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 4 to Credit Agreement which permitted outstanding letters of credit under the SSE credit facility to be deemed to be incurred under our credit facility and increased the amount of the accordion feature of our revolving credit facility to permit aggregate commitments to be increased to an amount not to exceed $700 million (subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the procurement of additional commitments from new or existing lenders). On April 20, 2017, we also entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility (after giving effect to both commitment increases) increased to $632 million through September 2017 and to $490 million through March 2019. On October 27, 2017, we entered into an additional commitment increase agreement with certain of our lenders pursuant to which total commitments available under our revolving credit facility increased to $500 million through March 27, 2019.\nFor the three years ended December 31, 2017, our operating income (loss) consisted of the following (dollars in thousands):\nBased on current commodity prices, our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 and management's expectations of operating results in future periods, we concluded that no triggering events occurred during the year ended December 31, 2017 with respect to our reporting segments. Our expectations of future operating results were based on the assumption that activity levels in all segments and our other operations will remain relatively stable or improve in response to relatively stable or increasing oil prices.\n \n\n (1) Margin is defined as revenues less direct operating costs and excludes depreciation, amortization and impairment and selling, general and administrative expenses. Average margin per operating day is defined as margin divided by operating days. \nUpon the occurrence of a change of control, as defined in the indenture, each holder of the 2028 Notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of such holder's 2028 Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the repurchase date.\n\n (1) The average oil price represents the average monthly WTI spot price as reported by the United States Energy Information Administration. \nThe Series A Notes and Series B Notes are senior unsecured obligations, which rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsubordinated indebtedness. The Series A Notes and Series B Notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by each of our domestic subsidiaries other than subsidiaries that are not required to be guarantors under the Credit Agreement.\n \n\nDuring the third quarter of 2015, oil prices declined and averaged $46.42 per barrel, reaching a new low for 2015 of $38.22 per barrel in August 2015. In light of these lower oil prices in August, we lowered our expectations with respect to future activity levels in both the contract drilling and pressure pumping businesses. As a result of our revised expectations of the duration of the lower oil and natural gas commodity price environment and the related deterioration of the markets for our contract drilling and pressure pumping services, we performed a quantitative Step 1 impairment assessment of our goodwill as of September 30, 2015. In completing the Step 1 assessment, the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated using both the income and market valuation methods. The estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit required the use of significant unobservable inputs, representative of a Level 3 fair value measurement. The inputs included assumptions related to the future performance of our contract drilling and pressure pumping reporting units, such as future oil and natural gas prices and projected demand for our services, and assumptions related to discount rates, long-term growth rates and control premiums.\nRevenues and direct operating costs increased in 2017 primarily due to an increase in the number and size of fracturing jobs. The total number of jobs increased as a result of the SSE merger and a recovery in the oil and natural gas industry. Average revenue per job increased due to improved pricing and an increase in the size of the jobs. Average direct operating costs per total job increased primarily due to the increase in the size of the jobs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased due to the increase in organizational size and activity as a result of the SSE merger. The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to higher maintenance capital expenditures as a result of higher activity and investments to reactivate frac spreads.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants. We do not expect that the restrictions and covenants will impair, in any material respect, our ability to operate or react to opportunities that might arise.\nOn February 7, 2018, our Board of Directors approved a cash dividend on our common stock in the amount of $0.02 per share to be paid on March 22, 2018 to holders of record as of March 8, 2018. The amount and timing of all future dividend payments, if any, are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, results of operations, financial condition, terms of our debt agreements and other factors.\nOn October 11, 2017, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding limited liability company interests of MS Directional. The aggregate consideration paid by us consisted of $69.8 million in cash and approximately 8.8 million shares of our common stock. Based on the closing price of our common stock on the closing date of the transaction, the total fair value of the consideration transferred to effect the acquisition of MS Directional was approximately $257 million.\nWe believe our current liquidity, together with cash expected to be generated from operations in 2018, should provide us with sufficient ability to fund our current plans to maintain and make improvements to our existing equipment, service our debt and pay cash dividends for at least the next 12 months. If we pursue opportunities for growth that require capital, we believe we would be able to satisfy these needs through a combination of working capital, cash flows from operating activities, borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility or additional debt or equity financing. However, there can be no assurance that such capital will be available on reasonable terms, if at all.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n \u2022 fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in acquisitions, \nThe indenture pursuant to which the 2028 Notes were issued includes covenants that, among other things, limit our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur certain liens, engage in sale and lease-back transactions or consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of their assets.

report:\n\nRevenue Recognition\n- Revenues from contract drilling, pressure pumping, directional drilling, oilfield rentals, and related activities are recognized as services are performed.\n\nResults by Segment\n- Pressure pumping revenues increased 239% in 2017 compared to 2016, with improved pricing and more jobs. Operating income was $21 million in 2017 versus a $(177) million loss in 2016.\n\n- Contract drilling revenues increased 91.3% with the recovery in drilling activity and acquisition of SSE rigs. But operating loss increased to $(172) million in 2017 from $(236) million in 2016 due to impairment charges. \n\n- Directional drilling is a new segment from the October 2017 acquisition of MS Directional. Had minimal impact on 2017 results.\n\n2017 Developments\n- Completed merger with Sidewinder Drilling to add 91 drilling rigs and 500,000 horsepower of pressure pumping equipment. \n- Acquired MS Directional directional drilling company in October 2017.\n- Completed $472 million common stock offering and used proceeds to repay SSE debt.\n\nOutlook \n- Continued recovery in oil prices and rig counts should drive improved activity levels and financial performance in 2018. Term contracts provide support for 96 rigs operating in Q1 2018.\n\nLiquidity\n- Had working capital of $201 million and $227 million available borrowing capacity at year end 2017. Expects to fund operations, dividends and moderate growth opportunities in 2018 from operating cash flows.\n\nHope this helps summarize the key items from the long MD&A report! Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."}
