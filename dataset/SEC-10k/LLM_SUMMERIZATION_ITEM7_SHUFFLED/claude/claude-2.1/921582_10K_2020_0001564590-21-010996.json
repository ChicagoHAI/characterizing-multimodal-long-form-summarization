Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOVERVIEW\nIMAX is one of the world's leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in technological innovations powering the presentation of some of today's most immersive entertainment experiences. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution to create the highest quality, most immersive motion picture and other entertainment event experiences for which the IMAX\u00ae brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and movie studios utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and, as a result, IMAX's network is among the most important and successful distribution platforms for major films and other events around the world.\nThe Company leverages its innovative technology and engineering in all aspects of its core business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other presentations into the IMAX format ( IMAX DMR\u201d) and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems ( IMAX Theater Systems\u201d).\nIMAX Theater Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company's 53-year history. The Company's customers are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the theaters in the IMAX network, but sells or leases the IMAX Theater System along with a license to use its trademarks.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 1,650 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 84 countries and territories, including 1,562 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 76 institutional locations. This compares to 1,624 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 81 countries and territories as of December 31, 2019 including 1,529 commercial multiplexes, 14 commercial destinations, and 81 institutional locations. (See the table below under IMAX Network and Backlog\u201d for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.)\nThe IMAX Theater System provides the Company's exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the ability to exhibit content that has undergone the IMAX DMR\u00ae conversion process, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer's peripheral vision and creates more realistic images;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition, certain movies shown in IMAX theaters are filmed using proprietary IMAX film and IMAX certified digital cameras, which offer filmmakers customized guidance and a workflow process to provide further enhanced and differentiated image quality and a film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen.\nTogether these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive and exciting experience than a traditional theater.\nAs a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience\u00ae, the Company's exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box office for the Company's exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films.\nAs one of the world's leaders in entertainment technology, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. In 2018, the Company introduced IMAX with Laser, a laser projection system designed for IMAX theaters in commercial multiplexes, which represents a further evolution of IMAX's proprietary technology. The Company believes that IMAX with Laser delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that IMAX with Laser is helping facilitate the next major lease renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network.\nThe Company is also experimenting with new technologies and new content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, which includes curating unique, differentiated alternative content to be exhibited in IMAX theaters, particularly during those periods when Hollywood blockbuster film content is not available.\nIMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nIn late January 2020, in response to the public health risks associated with COVID-19, the Chinese government directed exhibitors in China to temporarily close more than 70,000 movie theaters, including all of the approximately 700 IMAX theaters in mainland China. On March 11, 2020, due to the worsening public health crisis associated with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and in the following weeks, local, state and national governments instituted stay-at-home orders and restrictions on large public gatherings which caused movie theaters in countries around the world to temporarily close, including substantially all of the IMAX theaters in those countries. As a result of the theater closures, movie studios postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films were released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. More recently, stay-at-home orders have been lifted in many countries and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened in the third quarter of 2020 with reduced capacities, physical distancing requirements, and other safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, 71% of the theaters in the IMAX commercial multiplex network were open, spanning 41 countries. This included 44% of the theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) locations, 97% of the theaters in Greater China and 53% of the theaters in Rest of World markets. In many parts of Asia, audiences have returned to theaters, particularly IMAX theaters, in numbers consistent with pre-pandemic attendance levels despite the continued delay of Hollywood theatrical releases, which typically account for 70% of box office ticket sales in those regions. Management believes this indicates that moviegoers are eager to return to cinemas where and when theaters are open and moviegoers feel safe. However, ticket sales have been significantly lower than normal levels in theaters outside of Asia as Hollywood movie studios have further delayed the theatrical release dates for a number of films. As a result, certain theater chains have remained closed or have reduced their operating hours. In addition, theaters in major markets remain temporarily closed.\nThe repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the Company's revenues, earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 as gross box office ( GBO\u201d) results from the Company's theater customers declined significantly, the installation of certain theater systems was delayed, and maintenance services were generally suspended for theaters that were closed. While there continues to be a lack of new films released by movie studios and a significant number of theaters in the IMAX network are closed, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in earnings and operating cash flows as it is generating significantly lower than normal levels of GBO-based revenue from its joint revenue sharing arrangements and digital remastering services, it is unable to provide normal maintenance services to any of the theaters that remain closed, and while some installation activity is continuing, certain theater system installations have, and may continue to be delayed. In addition, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor customers who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the theater closures. In response, the Company has provided temporary relief to exhibitor customers by waiving or reducing maintenance fees during periods when theaters are closed or operating with reduced capacities and, in certain situations, by providing extended payment terms on annual minimum payment obligations in exchange for a corresponding or longer extension of the term of the underlying sale or lease arrangement. In 2020, the Company increased its provision for current expected credit losses by $18.6 million, in part reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater related accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, which management believes is primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and adequately addresses the risk of not collecting these receivables in full.\nManagement is encouraged by recent box office results in markets like China, Japan and South Korea where the virus is under control and audiences have demonstrated a willingness to return to cinema. However, the Company may continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic even after a significant portion or all theaters are reopened. The global economic impact of COVID-19 has led to record levels of unemployment in certain countries, which has led to, and may continue to result in lower consumer spending. The timing and extent of a recovery of consumer behavior and willingness to spend discretionary income on movie-going may delay the Company's ability to generate significant GBO-based revenue until consumer behavior normalizes and consumer spending recovers.\nIn response to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company has taken and is continuing to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs, placing certain employees on a temporary furlough, reducing the working hours of other employees and reducing all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels.\nThe Company has also implemented an active cash management process, which, among other things, requires senior management approval of all outgoing payments. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, the Company drew down $280.0 million in remaining available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility provided by its Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (both as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), which was then amended in June 2020 to, among other things, suspend the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant in the Credit Agreement through the first quarter of 2021 and substitute quarterly EBITDA from the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in lieu of the EBITDA for the corresponding quarters of 2020 to meet the original Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its requirements under the Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company's continued compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement will depend on the Company's ability to generate sufficient EBITDA to ensure compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months, which is dependent on the timing of when theaters in the IMAX network resume normal operations. The risk of breaching this covenant within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nThe Company has applied for and received wage subsidies, tax credits and other financial support under COVID-19 relief legislation that has been enacted in the countries in which it operates. During 2020, the Company recognized $6.4 million in benefits from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ( CEWS\u201d) program and $0.7 million in benefits from the U.S. CARES Act, as reductions to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ($6.0 million), Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues ($1.0 million) and Research and Development ($0.1 million) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The CEWS program has been extended to June 2021. The Company will continue to review and apply for additional subsidies and credits for the remaining terms of these programs, where applicable.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test considering the latest available information and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total Goodwill was $39.0 million, of which $19.1 million relates to the IMAX Systems reporting unit, $13.5 million relates to the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement reporting unit, and $6.4 million relates to the IMAX Maintenance reporting unit. The impairment test was performed on a reporting unit level by comparing each unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management's current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company also updated its recoverability tests of the carrying values of the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are recorded within Property, Plant and Equipment. In performing its reviews of recoverability, the Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. The cash flow estimates used in these tests are consistent with management's estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses were performed. These estimates are highly uncertain due to the COVID-19 global pandemic; therefore, management's estimated cash flows factor in a number of underlying variables and ranges of possible cash flow scenarios. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million related to the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements. (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and recorded a $23.7 million valuation allowance to reduce the value of deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company increased the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by $4.9 million due to additional losses recorded in the period. The valuation allowance is expected to reverse when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from the tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\nIf business conditions deteriorate further, or should they remain depressed for a more prolonged period of time, management's estimates of operating results and future cash flows for the IMAX Systems and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements reporting units may be insufficient to support the goodwill assigned to them, thus requiring impairment charges. The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, estimates related to future expected credit losses and the recoverability of deferred tax assets, as well as the recoverability of joint revenue sharing equipment assets and the realization of variable consideration assets, could also be further impacted by changes in management's estimates. (see Notes 3, 5 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8).\n(See Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nSOURCES OF REVENUE\nFor the purposes of MD&A the Company has organized its reportable segments into the following four categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; (iii) New Business Initiatives; and (iv) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these four categories are the Company's following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements; (iii) IMAX Systems; (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) New Business Initiatives; (vii) Film Distribution; and (viii) Film Post-Production. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated certain financial statement line descriptions (with no change to the classification of amounts) within Revenues and Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues in its Consolidated Statements of Operations to better describe the nature of its revenue-generating activities and related costs.\nIMAX Technology Network\nThe IMAX Technology Network category earns revenue based on contingent box office receipts and includes the IMAX DMR segment and contingent rent from the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement ( JRSA\u201d) segment, as described in more detail below.\nIMAX DMR\nThe Company has developed IMAX DMR, a proprietary technology that digitally remasters Hollywood films into IMAX formats. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a movie studio in exchange for converting a commercial film into IMAX DMR format and distributing it through the IMAX network. In recent years, the percentage of gross box office receipts earned in IMAX DMR arrangements has averaged approximately 12.5%, except for within Greater China, where the Company receives a lower percentage of net box office receipts for certain Hollywood films.\nIMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited in IMAX theaters is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release of the film. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position.\nIMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as IMAX DNA\u201d. Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience's immersion in the film and taking advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen. Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film in history, released in April 2019, was shot entirely using IMAX cameras. In 2020, Universal Pictures' 1917 was released with select scenes specifically formatted for IMAX screens, Warner Bros. Pictures' Tenet was filmed with IMAX cameras, and Warner Bros. Pictures' Wonder Woman 1984, released globally in December 2020, was partially shot with IMAX cameras. In addition, Bona Film's The Rescue, which was released in China in December 2020, has an expanded aspect ratio that is exclusive to IMAX.\nThe Company believes that growth in international box office remains an important driver of growth for the Company. To support continued growth in international markets, the Company has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing the Company's film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local IMAX DMR releases in select markets, particularly in China. During 2019, 18 local language IMAX DMR films were released to the IMAX network, including 14 in China and one in each of Japan, South Korea, India and Russia. The blockbuster Ne Zha: The IMAX Experience was released in China in July 2019 and it is the Company's first Chinese animated local language film title. During 2020, 17 local language IMAX DMR films were released into the IMAX network, including ten in China, three in Russia, three in Japan, and one in South Korea. The Company expects to announce additional local language IMAX DMR films to be released to the IMAX network in 2021.\nThe Company remains in active negotiations with all major Hollywood studios for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate for the IMAX network. However, as a result of the theater closures associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, Hollywood movie studios have postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films have been released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. Accordingly, as of the filing of this report, there remains uncertainty around the release dates of certain major films.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Contingent Rent\nThe JRSA segment provides IMAX Theater Systems to exhibitors through joint revenue sharing arrangements. Under the traditional form of these arrangements, IMAX provides the IMAX projection and sound system under a long-term lease in which the Company assumes the majority of the equipment and installation costs. In exchange for its upfront investment, the Company earns rent based on a percentage of contingent box office receipts and, in some cases, concession revenues, rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront fee or annual minimum payments. Rental payments from the customer are required throughout the term of the arrangement and are due either monthly or quarterly. The Company retains title to the IMAX Theater System equipment components throughout the lease term, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement.\nUnder certain other joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX Theater System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. As with a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the customer also pays the Company a percentage of contingent box office receipts over the term of the arrangement, although this percentage is typically half that of a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, while the fixed upfront payment is recorded as revenue within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a sale, see the discussion below under IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance.\nUnder most joint revenue sharing arrangements (both traditional and hybrid), the initial non-cancellable term is 10 years or longer and is renewable by the customer for one to two additional terms of between three to five years. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are non-cancellable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations.\nThe revenue earned from customers under the Company's joint revenue sharing arrangements can vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors including film performance, the mix of theater system configurations, the timing of installation of these IMAX Theater Systems, the nature of the arrangement, the location, size and management of the theater and other factors specific to individual arrangements.\nJoint revenue sharing arrangements also require IMAX to provide maintenance and extended warranty services to the customer over the term of the lease in exchange for a separate fixed annual fee. These fees are reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below.\nThe introduction of joint revenue sharing arrangements has been an important factor in the expansion of the Company's commercial theater network. Joint revenue sharing arrangements allow commercial theater exhibitors to install IMAX Theater Systems without the significant initial capital investment required in a sale or sales-type lease arrangement. Joint revenue sharing arrangements drive recurring cash flows and earnings for the Company, as customers under joint revenue sharing arrangements pay the Company a portion of their ongoing box office. The Company funds its joint revenue sharing arrangements through cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 890 theaters in operation under joint revenue sharing arrangements, a 2.3% increase as compared to the 870 theaters in operation under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2019. The Company also had contracts in backlog for 342 theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2020, including 87 upgrades to existing theater locations and 255 new theater locations.\nIMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance\nThe IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category earns revenue principally from the sale or sale-type lease of IMAX Theater Systems, as well as from the maintenance of IMAX Theater Systems. To a lesser extent, the IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category earns revenue from certain ancillary theater business activities and revenues from hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements. These activities are described in more detail below under each of their respective segments.\nIMAX Systems\nThe IMAX Systems segment provides IMAX Theater Systems to exhibitors through sale arrangements or long-term lease arrangements that for accounting purposes are classified as sales-type leases. Under these arrangements, in exchange for providing the IMAX Theater System, the Company earns initial fees and ongoing consideration (which can include fixed annual minimum payments and contingent fees in excess of the minimum payments), as well as maintenance and extended warranty fees (see IMAX Maintenance\u201d below). The initial fees vary depending on the system configuration and location of the theater. Initial fees are paid to the Company in installments between the time of signing the arrangement and the time of system installation, which is when the total of these fees, in addition to the present value of future annual minimum payments, are recognized as revenue. Finance income is recognized over the term of a financed sale or sales-type lease arrangement. In addition, in sale arrangements, an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded, is recorded as revenue in the period when the sale is recognized and is adjusted in future periods based on actual results and changes in estimates. Such variable consideration is only recognized on sales transactions to the extent the Company believes there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal.\nIn sale arrangements, title to the IMAX Theater System equipment generally transfers to the customer. However, in certain instances, the Company retains title or a security interest in the equipment until the customer has made all payments required by the agreement or until certain shipment events for the equipment have occurred. In a sales-type lease arrangement, title to the IMAX Theater System equipment remains with the Company. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer.\nThe revenue earned from customers under the Company's theater system sales or lease agreements varies from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors, including the number and mix of theater system configurations sold or leased, the timing of installation of the IMAX Theater Systems, the nature of the arrangement and other factors specific to individual contracts.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Fixed Fees\nUnder certain joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX Theater System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, as discussed above, while the fixed upfront payment is reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance.\nIMAX Maintenance\nFor all IMAX theaters, theater owners or operators are also responsible for paying the Company an annual maintenance and extended warranty fee. Under these arrangements, the Company provides proactive and emergency maintenance services to every theater in its network to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the theater agreements.\nOther Theater Business\nThe Other Theater Business segment principally includes after-market sales of IMAX projection system parts and 3D glasses.\nNew Business Initiatives\nThe New Business Initiatives segment includes activities related to the exploration of new lines of business and new initiatives outside of the Company's core business, which seek to leverage its proprietary, innovative technologies, its leadership position in the entertainment technology space and its unique relationship with content creators. Such new business initiatives currently include IMAX Enhanced and Connected Theaters, as discussed below.\nIMAX Enhanced\nThe Company has developed a new home entertainment licensing and certification program called IMAX Enhanced. This initiative was launched along with audio leader DTS (an Xperi subsidiary), capitalizing on the companies' decades of combined expertise in image and sound science. IMAX Enhanced brings IMAX digitally re-mastered 4K high dynamic range (HDR) content and DTS audio technologies to premier streaming platforms and best-in-class consumer electronics devices worldwide, offering consumers high-fidelity sight and sound experiences for the home.\nTo be certified, leading consumer electronics manufacturers spanning 4K/8K televisions, projectors, A/V receivers, loudspeakers, subwoofers and soundbars must meet a carefully prescribed set of audio and video performance standards, set by a certification committee of IMAX and DTS engineers and some of Hollywood's leading technical specialists.\nIMAX Enhanced global device partners include Sony Electronics, Hisense, TCL, Phillips, Xiaomi, Sound United among others. By March 2021, IMAX Enhanced will have over six million certified devices in-market. IMAX Enhanced content is now available on six streaming platforms worldwide, with partners that include Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Huayi Brothers, Bona Film Group, Tencent Video, iQIYI and FandangoNOW, with more on the way.\nConnected Theaters\nThe Company is currently exploring new technologies and forms of content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, including new technologies to further connect the IMAX network and to facilitate bringing more unique content, including live events, to IMAX theater audiences. The Company believes such additional connectivity can provide more innovative content to the IMAX network and in turn permit the Company to engage audiences in new ways.\nThe Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content, especially during periods between peak and off-peak seasons, known as \"shoulder periods\".\nFilm Distribution and Post-Production\nThrough the Film Distribution segment, the Company licenses film content and distributes large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company receives as its distribution fee either a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the theater box office receipts and following the Company's recoupment of its costs the Company typically is entitled to receive an additional percentage of gross revenues as participation revenues. The Company released the IMAX original production, Asteroid Hunters, in October 2020.\nThe Film Post-Production segment provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced by IMAX or third parties), and digital post-production services.\nIMAX NETWORK AND BACKLOG\nIMAX Network\nThe following table provides detailed information about the IMAX

multiplex network could grow to approximately 3,318 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,562 operating as of December 31, 2020. The Company believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As of December 31, 2020, 72.8% of IMAX Theater Systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), an increase from 71.9% as of December 31, 2019. Revenues and gross box office derived from international markets continue to exceed revenues and gross box office from the United States and Canada. This was especially true during 2020 as the pace and extent of the reopening of IMAX theaters in Greater China amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic exceeded that of theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) and Rest of World markets. (See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above.) Risks associated with the Company's international business are outlined in Risk Factors - The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales and future growth prospects\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nGreater China is the Company's largest market, measured by revenues, with approximately 38% and 31% of overall revenues generated from its China operations in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 745 theaters operating in Greater China with an additional 251 theaters in backlog that are scheduled to be installed by 2028. The Company's backlog in Greater China represents 47.6% of its total current backlog, including upgrades. The Company's largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Film ( Wanda\u201d). Wanda's total commitment to the Company is for 361 IMAX Theater Systems in Greater China (of which 347 IMAX Theater Systems are under the parties' joint revenue sharing arrangement).\n(See Risk Factors - The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there\u201d and Risk Factors - General political, social and economic conditions can affect the Company's business by reducing both revenue generated from existing IMAX Theater Systems and the demand for new IMAX Theater Systems\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its

Future contingent payments are not reflected as these are based on negotiated shares of box office results.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe number of IMAX Theater Systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Theater Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues. The value of backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases and long-term conditional theater commitments. Theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements do not usually have dollar value backlog, although certain IMAX Theater Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX Theater System installations that are listed in backlog are valid and binding commitments.\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX Theater System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue.\nCertain of the Company's contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type during the term or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing but before installation. Current backlog information reflects all known elections.\nThe following tables provide detailed information about the Company's backlog by arrangement type and geographic location as of December 31,

of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management's judgments, assumptions, and estimates are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors that are believed to be reasonable as of the date of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may ultimately differ from the Company's original estimates, as future events and circumstances sometimes do not develop as expected, and the differences may be material. Management believes that the following are the Company's most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are not ranked in any particular order, that may affect the Company's reported results of operations and/or financial condition. The Company's other significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe application of U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires management to make judgments and estimates. In addition, revenue contracts with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting.\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. In conjunction with its adoption, the Company applied ASC Topic 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of the date of adoption, referred to as open contracts. IMAX Theater System sales and maintenance contracts within the existing network of open theaters and sales backlog comprise a significant majority of the Company's open contracts at any point in time. DMR arrangements where the film continues to be shown by the Company's exhibitor partners, film distribution arrangements with remaining terms, and aftermarket sales orders that have been received but for which control of the product has not yet transferred to the customer are all also considered open contracts.\nRevenues from the sale of IMAX Theater Systems, the provision of maintenance services for IMAX Theater Systems, the sale of aftermarket projection system parts and 3D glasses, the conversion of film content into the IMAX DMR format, the distribution of documentary film content and the provision of post-production services are all within the scope of ASC Topic 606. The Company's joint revenue sharing revenue arrangements, with the exception of those where title of the IMAX Theater System transfers to the customer, known as hybrid sales, are not in scope of ASC Topic 606 as they are classified as leases. Similarly, any IMAX Theater System arrangements classified as sales-type leases are also excluded from ASC Topic 606.\nIMAX Theater Systems\nThe Company evaluates each of the performance obligations in an IMAX Theater System arrangement to determine which are considered distinct, either individually or in a group, for accounting purposes and which of the deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on the applicable accounting guidance in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d ASC Topic 842, Leases,\u201d and ASC Topic 460, Guarantees\u201d.\nThe Company's System Obligation\u201d consists of the following: (i) an IMAX Theater System, which includes the projector, sound system, screen system and, if applicable, a 3D glasses cleaning machine; (ii) services associated with the IMAX Theater System, including theater design support, the supervision of installation services, and projectionist training; and (iii) a license to use the IMAX brand to market the theater. The System Obligation, as a group, is a distinct performance obligation and a single unit of accounting. The Company is not responsible for the physical installation of the equipment in the customer's facility; however, it supervises the installation by the customer. The customer has the right to use the IMAX brand from the date the Company and the customer enter into an arrangement.\nIMAX Theater System arrangements also include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement in exchange for an extended warranty and annual maintenance fee, which is subject to a consumer price index increase on renewal each year. Consideration related to the provision of maintenance services is included in the allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the arrangement at contract inception, as discussed in more detail below. The Company's maintenance services are a stand ready obligation and, as a result, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term.\nThe transaction price in an IMAX Theater System arrangement is allocated to each good or service that is identified as a separate performance obligation based on estimated standalone selling prices. This allocation is based on observable prices when the Company sells the good or service separately. The Company has established standalone prices for the System Obligation and maintenance and extended warranty services, as well as for film license arrangements. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach for separate performance obligations that do not have standalone selling prices or third-party evidence of estimated standalone selling prices. The Company considers multiple factors including its historical pricing practices, product class, market competition and geography.\nThe transaction price for the System Obligation consists of upfront or initial payments made before and after the final installation of the IMAX Theater System and ongoing payments throughout the term of the arrangement. The Company estimates the transaction price, including an estimate of future variable consideration, received in exchange for the goods delivered or services rendered. The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX Theater System includes indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include amounts owed by the customer based on a percentage of their box office receipts over the term of the arrangement. These contract provisions are considered to be variable consideration under ASC Topic 606. An estimate of the present value of such variable consideration is recognized as revenue upon the transfer of control of the System Obligation to the customer, subject to constraints to ensure that there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal. This estimate is based on management's box office projections for the individual theater, which are developed using historical data for the theater and, if necessary, comparable theaters and territories. Transfer of control of the System Obligation occurs at the earlier of client acceptance of the installation of the IMAX Theater System, including projectionist training, and the opening of the theater to the public.\nIMAX Theater System arrangements are non-cancellable unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. In the absence of a material default by the Company, there is no right to any remedy for the customer under the Company's arrangements. If a material default by the Company exists, the customer has the right to terminate the arrangement and seek a refund only if the customer provides notice to the Company of a material default and only if the Company does not cure the default within a specified period.\nConstraints on the Recognition of Variable Consideration\nThe recognition of variable consideration involves a significant amount of judgment. Variable consideration is recognized subject to appropriate constraints to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in future periods. The Company reviews its variable consideration assets on at least a quarterly basis. ASC Topic 606 identifies several examples of situations when constraining variable consideration is appropriate:\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity's influence;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 123: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company's experience (or other evidence) with similar types of contracts is limited, or that experience has limited predictive value; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 124: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The entity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price concessions or changing the payment terms and conditions of similar contracts in similar circumstances.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs discussed above, the Company's significant streams of variable consideration relate to arrangements for the sale of IMAX Theater Systems which include indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include variable consideration based on a percentage of the customer's box office receipts over the term of the arrangement.\nVariable consideration related to indexed minimum payment increases is outside of the Company's control, but the movement in the rates is historically well documented and economic trends in inflation are easily accessible. For each contract subject to an indexed minimum payment increase, the Company estimates the most likely amount using published indices. The amount of the estimated minimum payment increase is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using the customer's implied borrowing rate.\nVariable consideration related to the level of the customer's box office receipts is outside of the Company's control as it is dependent upon the commercial success of film content in future periods. The Company tracks numerous performance statistics for box office performance in regions worldwide and applies its understanding of these theater markets to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration to be earned over the term of the arrangement. The Company then applies a constraint to this estimate by reducing the projection by a percentage factor for theaters or markets with no or limited historical box office experience. In cases where direct historical experience can be observed, average experience, eliminating significant outliers, is used. The resulting amount of variable consideration is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using a risk-weighted discount rate.\nIMAX DMR and Film Distribution Services\nIn an IMAX DMR arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a third party who owns the copyright to a film in exchange for converting the film into IMAX DMR format and distributing it through the IMAX network. In these arrangements, although the Company does not hold rights to the intellectual property in the form of the film content, it is compensated for the application of its intellectual property in the form of its patented DMR processes to create new intellectual property in the form of an IMAX DMR version of film.\nIn a Film Distribution arrangement, the Company licenses film content and distributes large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company's Film Distribution revenues are strictly from the license of its intellectual property in the form of documentary film content to which the Company holds exclusive distribution rights.\nRevenues associated with both IMAX DMR and Film Distribution arrangements qualify for the variable consideration exemption for sales- or usage-based royalties in ASC Topic 606 and are recognized in the period when the corresponding box office sales occur.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\nIn 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASC Topic 326\u201d), which amends previously issued guidance regarding the impairment of financial instruments by creating an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The standard requires financial assets measured on the amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The Company's accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables are within the scope of ASU No. 2016-13. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 and several associated ASUs on January 1, 2020 with no required cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. (See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe ability of the Company to collect its accounts receivable, financing receivable and variable consideration receivables is heavily dependent on the viability and solvency of individual theater operators which is significantly influenced by consumer behavior and general economic conditions. Theater operators and, in certain situations, movie studios, may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their payment obligations to the Company.\nThe Company develops its estimate of credit losses by class of receivable and customer type through a calculation that utilizes historical loss rates which are then adjusted for specific receivables that are judged to have a higher than normal risk profile after taking into account management's internal credit quality classifications, as well as macro-economic and industry risk factors.\nJudgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, and the amount of any required allowance for credit losses, are based on management's initial credit evaluation of the customer and the regular ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of each customer. This monitoring process includes an analysis of collections history and aging for each customer, as well as meetings on at least a monthly basis to identify credit concerns and potential changes in credit quality classification. A customer may improve their credit quality classification once a substantial payment is made on an overdue balance or when the customer has agreed to a payment plan and payments have commenced in accordance with that plan. Changes in credit quality classification are dependent upon management approval. Management's judgments with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, and the amount of any required allowance for credit losses, may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor partners who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the disruption in their normal business operations during the pandemic. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company increased its provision for current expected credit losses by $18.6 million, reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater related receivables balances and the heightened collection risk associated with certain movie studios in foreign markets. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on the Company's customers and their ability to meet their financial obligations to the Company is difficult to predict.\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nInventories\nThe Company records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory based upon management's judgments regarding future events and business conditions, including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts, contracts in negotiation, technological developments, growth prospects within the customers' ultimate marketplace and anticipated market acceptance of the Company's current and pending theater systems.\nAsset Impairments\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of the year and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. These indicators could include a decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization, a significant change in the outlook for the reporting unit's business, lower than expected operating results, increased competition, legal factors, or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. For reporting units with goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management's current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test considering the latest available information and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total Goodwill was $39.0 million, of which $19.1 million relates to the IMAX Systems reporting unit, $13.5 million relates to the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement reporting unit, and $6.4 million relates to the IMAX Maintenance reporting unit.\nThe estimates used in the Company's goodwill impairment tests and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. If business conditions deteriorate further, or should they remain depressed for a more prolonged period of time, management's estimates of operating results and future cash flows for the IMAX Systems and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements reporting units may be insufficient to support the goodwill assigned to them, thus requiring impairment charges. The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are grouped and reviewed for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In such situations, long-lived assets are considered impaired when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying value of the asset (or asset group). In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is written down to its fair value, which is the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Factors that are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include a current expectation that it is more likely than not that the long-lived asset will be sold significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant decrease in the market price of the long-lived asset, and a significant change in the extent or manner in which the long-lived asset is being used.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company updated its recoverability tests of the carrying values of the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are recorded within Property, Plant and Equipment. In performing its reviews of recoverability, the Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. The cash flow estimates used in these tests are consistent with management's estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses were performed. These estimates are highly uncertain due to the COVID-19 global pandemic; therefore, management's estimated cash flows factor in a number of underlying variables and ranges of possible cash flow scenarios. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million related to the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements.\nFilm Assets\nThe recoverability of the Company's film assets is dependent upon the commercial acceptance of the underlying films and the resulting level of box office results and, in certain situations, ancillary revenues. If management's projections of future net cash flows resulting from the exploitation of a film indicate that the carrying value of the film asset is not recoverable, the film asset is written down to its fair value.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $10.8 million in impairment losses principally to write-down the carrying value of certain documentary, alternative content film assets and DMR related film assets due to a decrease in projected box office totals and related revenues based on management's regular quarterly recoverability assessments. As of December 31, 2020, following the recording of these write-downs, the Company's film assets totaled $5.8 million, which principally consists of DMR and documentary content. There can be no assurances that there will not be additional write-downs to the carrying values of these assets as the Company continues to assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company issues share-based compensation to eligible employees, directors, and consultants under the IMAX Corporate Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (as may be amended, the IMAX LTIP\u201d) and the China Long-Term Incentive Plan (the China LTIP\u201d) as summarized below. On June 3, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the IMAX LTIP at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting. The IMAX LTIP is the Company's governing document and awards to employees, directors, and consultants under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted share units ( RSUs\u201d), performance share units ( PSUs\u201d) and other awards. A separate stock option plan, the China LTIP, was adopted by a subsidiary of the Company in October 2012.\nThe Company measures share-based compensation expense using the grant date fair value of the award, which is recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation expense is not adjusted for estimated forfeitures, but is instead adjusted when and if actual forfeitures occur.\nStock Options\nThe Company utilizes a lattice-binomial option-pricing model ( Binomial Model\u201d) to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date. The fair value determined by the Binomial Model is affected by the Company's stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Binomial Model also considers the expected exercise multiple which is the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Company's employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, in management's opinion, the Binomial Model best provides a fair measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options.\nThe Company stratifies its employees into homogeneous groups in order to calculate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Binomial Model. As a result, ranges of assumptions are used for the expected life of the option. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior within the Binomial Model and various groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are grouped together for valuation purposes. The expected volatility rate is estimated based on a blended volatility method which takes into consideration the Company's historical share price volatility, the Company's implied volatility which is determined in reference to observed current market prices for the Company's traded options and the Company's peer group volatility.\n(See Note 17(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Company's stock options.)\nRestricted Share Units\nThe fair value of RSU awards is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nPerformance Share Units\nThe Company grants two types of PSU awards, one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain EBITDA-based targets and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain stock-price targets. These awards vest over a three-year performance period. The grant date fair value of PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is equal to the closing price on the date of grant or the average closing price of the Company's common stock for five days prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs with stock-price targets is determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a valuation model that takes into account the likelihood of achieving the stock-price targets embedded in the award ( Monte Carlo Model\u201d). The compensation expense attributable to each type of PSU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. At the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from 0% to a maximum vesting opportunity of 175% of the initial award, depending upon actual performance versus the established EBITDA and stock-price targets.\nThe fair value determined by the Monte Carlo Model is affected by the Company's stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, market conditions as of the grant date, the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and other relevant data. The compensation expense is fixed on the date of grant based on the dollar value granted.\nThe amount and timing of compensation expense recognized for PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is dependent upon management's assessment of the likelihood and timing of achieving these targets. If, as a result of management's assessment, it is projected that a greater number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to increase compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if, as a result of management's assessment, it is projected that a lower number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to decrease compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change is enacted. Investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.\nThe Company assesses the realization of deferred income tax assets and, based on all available evidence, concludes whether it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred income tax assets not considered to be realizable. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers, among other things, projections of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If management determines that sufficient negative evidence exists (for example, if the Company experiences cumulative three-year losses in a certain jurisdiction), then management will consider recording a valuation allowance against a portion or all of the deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction. If, after recording a valuation allowance, management's projections of future taxable income and other positive evidence considered in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate, it could prove more difficult to support the realization of these deferred tax assets. As a result, an additional valuation allowance could be required, which would have an adverse impact on the Company's effective income tax rate and results. Conversely, if, after recording a valuation allowance, management determines that sufficient positive evidence exists in the jurisdiction in which a valuation allowance is recorded (for example, if the Company is no longer in a three-year cumulative loss position in the jurisdiction, and management expects to have future taxable income in that jurisdiction based upon management's forecasts and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals), the Company may reverse a portion or all of the valuation allowance in that jurisdiction. In such situations, the adjustment made to the deferred tax asset would have a favorable impact on the Company's effective income tax rate and results in the period such determination was made.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and recorded a $23.7 million valuation allowance to reduce the value of deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company increased the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by $4.9 million due to additional losses recorded in the period. The valuation allowance is expected to reverse when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from the tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. Although management believes that the Company has adequately accounted for its uncertain tax positions, tax audits can result in subsequent assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes above what was originally recognized in its financial statements.\nTax reserves for uncertain tax positions are adjusted by the Company to reflect management's best estimate of the outcome of examinations and assessments and in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with the uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. Some of these adjustments require significant judgment in estimating the timing and amount of the additional tax expense.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nPlease see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their impact on the Company's financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe Company's business and future prospects are evaluated by Richard L. Gelfond, its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d), using a variety of factors and financial and operational metrics including: (i) the signing, installation and financial performance of theater system arrangements, particularly joint revenue sharing arrangements and those involving laser-based projection systems; (ii) film performance and the securing of new film projects, particularly IMAX DMR films; (iii) the continuing ability to invest in and improve the Company's technology to enhance the differentiation of The IMAX Experience versus other cinematic experiences; (iv) revenues and gross margins earned by the Company's segments, as discussed below; (v) consolidated earnings from operations, as adjusted for unusual items; (vi) the overall execution, reliability and consumer acceptance of The IMAX Experience; (vii) the success of new business initiatives; and (viii) short- and long-term cash flow projections.\nThe CEO is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), as such term is defined under U.S. GAAP. The CODM, along with other members of management, assess segment performance based on segment revenues and gross margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development costs, the amortization of intangible assets, provisions for (recoveries of) current expected credit losses, certain write-downs, interest income, interest expense and income tax (expense) benefit are not allocated to the Company's segments.\nThe Company's reportable segments are organized into the following four categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; (iii) New Business Initiatives; and (iv) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these categories are the Company's following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements; (iii) IMAX Systems, (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) New Business Initiatives; (vii) Film Distribution; and (viii) Film Post-Production, each of which are described above under Sources of Revenue.\u201d This categorization is consistent with how the CODM reviews the financial performance of the Company and makes strategic decisions regarding resource allocation and investments to meet long-term business goals. Management believes that a discussion and analysis based on the four categories listed above is significantly more relevant and useful to readers, as the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations captions combine results from several segments.\nThe discussion of the Company's results of operations below compares results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A discussion of the Company's results of operations comparing results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is included under the section entitled Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $(143.8) million, or $(2.43) per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $46.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported an adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders* of $(112.1) million, or $(1.89) per diluted share*, as compared to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders* of $64.8 million, or $1.05 per diluted share*, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe following table presents the Company's revenue and gross margin

In the third quarter of 2020, stay-at-home orders were lifted in many countries and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened with reduced capacities, physical distancing requirements, and other safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, 71% of the theaters in the commercial multiplex network spanning 41 countries were open, including 44% of the theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) locations, 97% of the theaters in Greater China and 53% of the theaters in Rest of World markets. In many parts of Asia, audiences have returned to theaters, particularly IMAX theaters, in numbers consistent with pre-pandemic attendance levels despite the continued delay of Hollywood theatrical releases, which typically account for 70% of box office ticket sales in those regions. Management believes this indicates that moviegoers are eager to return to cinemas where and when theaters are open and moviegoers feel safe. However, ticket sales have been significantly lower than normal levels in theaters outside of Asia as Hollywood movie studios have further delayed the theatrical release dates for a number of films. As a result, certain theater chains have remained closed or have reduced their operating hours. In addition, theaters in major markets remain temporarily closed.\nAs a result of the factors discussed in the previous paragraph, the Company's consolidated results of operations and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2020 materially declined versus the prior year with total revenues and gross margin decreasing by $258.7 million (65%) and $192.7 million (90%), respectively.\n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nIMAX Technology Network\nIMAX Technology Network results are influenced by the level of commercial success and box office performance of the films released to the network, as well as other factors including the timing of the films released, the length of the theatrical distribution window, the take rates under the Company's DMR and joint revenue sharing arrangements and the level of marketing spend associated with the films released in the year. Other factors impacting IMAX Technology Network results include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies versus the U.S. Dollar.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Technology Network revenues and gross margin decreased by $151.3 million (77%) and $(122.8) million (97%), respectively, when compared to the prior year principally due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above. See below for separate discussions of IMAX DMR and JRSA contingent rent results for the year.\n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nIMAX DMR\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX DMR revenues and gross margin decreased by $92.5 million (77%) and $64.9 million (83%), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These decreases are due to a $849.3 million (77%) reduction in GBO generated by IMAX DMR films, from $1,108.5 million to $259.2 million, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GBO was generated primarily by the exhibition of 35 films (31 new and 4 carryovers) and the re-release of classic titles, as compared to 72 films (60 new and 12 carryovers) exhibited in 2019.\nIn addition to the level of revenues, IMAX DMR gross margin is also influenced by the costs associated with the films exhibited in the year, and can vary from year to year, particularly with respect to marketing expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, marketing expenses were $3.4 million, as compared to $22.5 million in the prior year.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Contingent Rent\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA contingent rent revenue and gross margin decreased by $58.8 million (77%) and $57.9 million (120%), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These decreases are due to a $429.3 million (77%) reduction in GBO generated by theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements during the current year, from $560.3 million to $131.0 million, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, 890 theaters were operating under joint revenue sharing arrangements, as compared to 870 theaters as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 2%. However, as discussed above, a portion of the theaters in the IMAX network remain closed as of December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition to the level of revenues, JRSA margin is also influenced by the level of costs associated with such arrangements, such as depreciation expense related to the underlying Theater Systems and costs incurred to upgrade Theater Systems from digital xenon to IMAX with Laser, as well as advertising, marketing and commission costs primarily for the launch of new theaters. The level of depreciation expense in a year relative to the prior year is a function of the growth of the theater network and the mix of theater system configurations in the network. For the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA gross margin included depreciation expense of $24.9 million, as compared to $23.2 million in the prior year reflecting a 2% increase in the number of theaters operating under joint revenue sharing arrangements during the year and the impact of new theaters operating throughout 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA gross margin includes certain advertising, marketing and commission costs of $1.4 million, as compared to $3.3 million in the prior year.\nIMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance\nThe primary drivers of IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance results are the number of IMAX Theater Systems installed in a year, and the level of gross margin percentage earned on each installation, as well as the associated maintenance contracts that accompany each theater installation. The installation of IMAX Theater Systems in newly built theaters or multiplexes, which make up a large portion of the Company's theater system backlog, depends primarily on the timing of the construction of those projects, which is not under the Company's control.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance revenue and gross margin decreased by $100.1 million (56%) and $58.4 million (68%), respectively, when compared to the prior year as the pace of theater system installations slowed significantly and maintenance revenue was not recognized for theaters that remained closed during the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above. See below for separate discussions of IMAX Systems and IMAX Maintenance results for the year.\nThe following table provides detailed information about the mix of IMAX Theater System installations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except number of systems)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nSystems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nSystems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New IMAX Theater Systems - installed and recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and sales-types lease arrangements(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 32,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 70,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Joint revenue sharing arrangements - hybrid\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,610\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total new IMAX Theater Systems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> IMAX theater system upgrades - installed and recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and sales-types lease arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total IMAX Theater Systems installed and recognized\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 44,507\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 100,607\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 130: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX Theater System includes fixed upfront and ongoing consideration, including indexed annual minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> Includes a digital theater system relocated from a previous location.

The average revenue per full (i.e., not hybrid) IMAX Theater System under sales and sales-type lease arrangements was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year.\n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nIMAX Systems\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Systems revenue and gross margin decreased by $53.3 million (50%) and $33.4 million (57%), respectively, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases are principally the result of 28 fewer IMAX Theater System installations and 11 fewer IMAX Theater System upgrades in the current year as the pace of theater system installations slowed significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIMAX Maintenance\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Maintenance revenue and gross margin decreased by $31.2 million (59%) and $19.9 million (87%), respectively, as maintenance revenue was not recognized during the periods of time when theaters were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nMaintenance margins vary depending on the mix of theater system configurations in the theater network, volume-pricing related to larger relationships and the timing and the date(s) of installation and/or service.\nFilm Distribution and Post-Production\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Film Distribution and Post-Production revenue and gross margin decreased by $3.5 million (29%) and $8.9 million, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The results for the year are significantly influenced by $10.0 million in impairment losses recorded in the year principally to write-down the carrying value of certain documentary and alternative content film assets due to a decrease in projected box office totals and related revenues based on management's regular quarterly recoverability assessments. As of December 31, 2020, following the recording of these write-downs, the Company's film assets totaled $5.8 million, which principally consists of DMR and documentary content. There can be no assurances that there will not be additional write-downs to the carrying values of these assets as the Company continues to assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8).\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses decreased by $15.0 million (12%), when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation of $20.7 million, were $87.8 million, as compared to $102.7 million in the prior year, excluding share-based compensation of $20.8 million, representing a decrease of $14.9 million (14.5%). A portion of share-based compensation expense is recognized within Cost and Expenses Applicable to Revenue and Research and Development. (See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe comparison to the prior year is significantly influenced by COVID-19 government relief that the Company became entitled to receive during the year under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program and the U.S. CARES Act, of which $6.0 million was recognized in 2020 as a reduction to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Also impacting the comparison to the prior year are management's cost control efforts and lower business activity amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic resulting in lower staff costs, travel, facilities and marketing related expenses, among others. These factors are partially offset by a $19.6 million (38%) decrease in labor and other costs capitalized to inventory, film assets, and joint venture theater equipment or allocated to costs applicable to revenues, due to the lower level of production during the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nIn response to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company has taken and is continuing to take significant steps to preserve the cash by eliminating non-essential costs, placing certain employees on a temporary furlough, reducing the working hours of other employees and deferring all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels.\nResearch and Development\nA significant portion of the Company's research and development efforts over the past several years have been focused on IMAX with Laser, the Company's laser-based projection system, which the Company believes delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Research and Development expenses increased by $0.4 million (8%), when compared to the prior year, primarily due to costs associated with the Connected Theaters initiative.\nThe Company also intends to continue research and development in other areas considered important to the Company's continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of its projectors, certifying more IMAX cameras, enhancing the Company's image quality, expanding the applicability of the Company's digital technology in both theater and home entertainment and improvements to the DMR process.\nIn addition, the Company has been, and intends to continue, using time and resources during the business slowdown caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic to work on leveraging and developing technologies and systems to help bring additional interactivity to its theater network, better manage certain of the Company's internal workflows and better organize and codify certain of the Company's data. During previous adverse events and downturns in the cinema business, the Company fostered many of the innovations that helped enable its global growth in recent years, including the development of its proprietary DMR process and the creation of its joint-revenue sharing business model.\nCredit Loss Expense\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of $18.6 million reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater and studio related receivable balances, which management believes is primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and adequately addresses the risk of not collecting these receivables in full. Management's judgments regarding expected credit losses are based on the facts available to management and involve estimates about the future. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on the Company's customers and their ability to meet their financial obligations to the Company is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company's judgments and associated estimates of credit losses may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect. For the year ended December 31, 2019, credit loss expense was $2.4 million. (See Notes 2 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nAsset Impairments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments of $1.2 million (2019 - $nil) principally related to write-down of content-related assets which became impaired in the year. (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.).\nLegal Judgment and Arbitration Awards\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a charge of $4.1 million associated with the Final Judgment issued on December 3, 2020 in respect of the Giencourt matter, as discussed in Note 16(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. No such charges were incurred in 2019.\nLoss in Fair Value of Investments\nIn the first quarter of 2019, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China, entered into a cornerstone investment agreement with Maoyan Entertainment ( Maoyan\u201d) and purchased equity securities for $15.2 million. These equity securities are traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the Company is required to adjust the fair value of the securities each period to reflect the current market value. This adjustment will fluctuate based on the closing market price at the end of each period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company's investment in Maoyan resulted in an unrealized loss of $2.1 million, as compared to an unrealized loss of $0.5 million in the prior year, which are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In February 2021, IMAX China (Hong Kong) sold all of its 7,949,000 shares of Maoyan for gross proceeds of $17.8 million, which represents a $2.6 million gain relative to the Company's acquisition cost. No shares of Maoyan are currently held by IMAX China (Hong Kong).\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense was $7.0 million in 2020, as compared to $2.8 million in the prior year. The increase in interest expense versus the prior year is due to a higher level of Credit Facility borrowings, which were outstanding for most of the year. In the first quarter of 2020, in response to uncertainties associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its impact on the Company's business, the Company drew down $280.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million. Furthermore, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement in June 2020, primarily to suspend the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant through the first quarter of 2021. During the amendment period, the applicable margin increased by 150 basis points. The fully drawn Credit Facility coupled with the increase to the applicable margin during the amendment period has resulted in higher interest expense in current year versus prior year period. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nIncluded in interest expense is the amortization of deferred finance costs in the amount of $0.9 million and $0.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company incurred fees of approximately $1.1 million in connection with the Credit Facility amendment, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2021. The Company's policy is to defer and amortize all the costs relating to debt financing which are paid directly to the debt provider, over the life of the debt instrument.\nIncome Taxes\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $26.5 million (2019 - $16.8 million), which includes a $28.6 million valuation allowance recorded in 2020. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. At the point in time when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized, the $28.6 million valuation allowance recorded in 2020 is expected to reverse. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2020 of (20.5)% differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 26.2%, primarily due to the recording of the valuation allowance discussed above, withholding taxes associated with the reversal of the indefinite reinvestment assertion for certain foreign subsidiaries, as discussed below, permanent book to tax differences, jurisdictional tax rate differences, and management's estimates of contingent liabilities related to the resolution of various tax examinations.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company's capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. As a result, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $19.1 million for the year for the estimated applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with these historical earnings, which will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include net deferred income tax assets of $18.0 million, net of a valuation allowance of $28.8 million (December 31, 2019 - $23.9 million, net of a valuation allowance of $0.2 million).\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include a deferred income tax liability of $19.1 million (December 31, 2019 - $nil).\nEquity Method Investments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported a loss of $1.9 million due to the write-off of deferred tax assets related to an equity method investment, as compared to $nil in 2019 related to its proportionate share of equity investee results.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the non-controlling interest in the net income (loss) of IMAX China as well as the impact of non-controlling interests in the activity of its Original Film Fund subsidiary. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of the Company's subsidiaries was $13.7 million (2019 \u2500 net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $11.7 million).\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nCredit Facility\nThe Company has a credit agreement, the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), as agent, and a syndicate of lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d) and are secured by first-priority security interests in substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. The facility provided by the Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d) matures on June 28, 2023.\nThe Credit Agreement has a revolving borrowing capacity of $300.0 million, and contains an uncommitted accordion feature allowing the Company to further expand its borrowing capacity to $440.0 million or greater, subject to certain conditions, depending on the mix of revolving and term loans comprising the incremental facility.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, in response to uncertainties associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its impact on the Company's business, the Company drew down $280.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), as of the last day of any Fiscal Quarter (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 3.25:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit indebtedness, liens, capital expenditures, asset sales, investments and restricted payments, in each case subject to negotiated exceptions and baskets. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and event of default provisions.\nOn June 10, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d), which, among other things, (i) suspends the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant through the first quarter of 2021, (ii) re-establishes the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant thereafter, provided that for subsequent quarters that such covenant is tested, as applicable, the Company will be permitted to use its quarterly EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in lieu of the EBITDA for the corresponding quarters of 2020, (iii) adds a $75.0 million minimum liquidity covenant measured at the end of each calendar month and (iv) restricts the Company's ability to make certain restricted payments, dispositions and investments, create or assume liens and incur debt that would otherwise have been permitted by the Credit Agreement. The modifications to the negative covenants, the minimum liquidity covenant and modifications to certain other provisions in the Credit Agreement pursuant to the Amendment were effective from the date of the Amendment until the earlier of the delivery of the compliance certificate for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the date on which the Company, in its sole discretion, elects to calculate its compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio by using either its actual EBITDA or annualized EBITDA (the Designated Period\u201d).\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its requirements under the Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company's continued compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement will depend on the Company's ability to generate sufficient EBITDA to ensure compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months, which is dependent on the timing of when theaters in the IMAX network resume normal operations. The risk of breaching this covenant within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum; or (ii) the U.S. base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% per annum, in each case depending on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement); provided, however, that from the effective date of the Amendment until the Company delivers a compliance certificate under the Credit Facility following the end of the Designated Period, the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings will be 2.50% per annum and the applicable margin for U.S. base rate borrowings will be 1.75% per annum. The effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.38% (2019 - 3.43%).\nIn addition, the Credit Facility has standby fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.38% per annum, based on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio with respect to the unused portion of the Credit Facility; provided, however, that from the effective date of the Amendment until the Company delivers a compliance certificate under the Credit Facility following the end of the Designated Period, the standby fee will be 0.50% per annum.\nThe Company incurred fees of approximately $1.1 million in connection with the Amendment, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any letters of credit and advance payment guarantees outstanding under the Credit Facility.\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nWorking Capital Facility\nOn July 24, 2020, IMAX (Shanghai) Multimedia Technology Co., Ltd. ( IMAX Shanghai\u201d), one of the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries in China, renewed its unsecured revolving facility for up to 200.0 million Renminbi (approximately $30.6 million) to fund ongoing working capital requirements (the Working Capital Facility\u201d). The facility expires in July 2021. As of December 31, 2020, there was 49.9 million Renminbi ($7.6 million) in borrowings outstanding, 140.1 million Renminbi ($21.5 million) available for future borrowings and 10.0 million Renminbi ($1.5 million) available for letters of guarantees under the Working Capital Facility. There were no amounts drawn under the Working Capital facility at December 31, 2019. The amounts available for borrowing under the Working Capital Facility are not subject to a standby fee. The effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.31% (2019 - nil).\nWells Fargo Foreign Exchange Facility\nWithin the Credit Facility, the Company is able to purchase foreign currency forward contracts and/or other swap arrangements. The net settlement gain on its foreign currency forward contracts was $2.0 million at December 31, 2020, as the fair value of the forward contracts exceeded the notional value (December 31, 2019 - $0.5 million). As of December 31, 2020, the Company has $31.9 million in notional value of such arrangements outstanding (December 31, 2019 - $36.1 million).\nNBC Facility\nOn October 28, 2019, the Company entered into a $5.0 million facility with the National Bank of Canada (the NBC Facility\u201d) fully insured by Export Development Canada for use solely in conjunction with the issuance of performance guarantees and letters of credit. The Company did not have any letters of credit and advance payment guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 under the NBC Facility.\nAssessment of Liquidity and Capital Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's principal sources of liquidity included: (i) its balances of cash and cash equivalents ($317.4 million, which reflects the full draw of the Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020); (ii) the anticipated collection of trade accounts receivable, which includes amounts owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements and DMR agreements with movie studios; (iii) the anticipated collection of financing receivables due in the next 12 months; and (iv) installment payments expected in the next 12 months on its existing sales and sales-type lease arrangements in backlog.\nThe Company's $317.4 million balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 includes $89.9 million in cash held outside of Canada (December 31, 2019-$90.1 million), of which $77.2 million was held in the People's Republic of China (the PRC\u201d) (December 31, 2019-$67.6 million). In the first quarter of 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company's capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $19.1 million for the applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with these historical earnings, which will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings.\nThe Company's operating cash flows and cash balances will be adversely affected if management's projections of future signings of IMAX Theater Systems and film performance, theater installations and film productions are not realized. The Company forecasts its short-term liquidity requirements on a quarterly and annual basis. Since the Company's future cash flows are based on estimates and there may be factors that are outside of the Company's control (see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A), there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to fund its operations through cash flows from operations. Under the terms of the Company's typical sale and sales-type lease agreements, the Company receives substantial cash payments before the Company completes the performance of its obligations. Similarly, the Company receives cash payments for some of its film productions in advance of related cash expenditures.\nThe repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the Company's revenues, earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 as GBO results from theater exhibitors declined significantly, the installation of certain Theater Systems was delayed, and maintenance services were generally suspended for theaters that were closed. During time periods when there is a lack of new films released by movie studios and a significant number of theaters in the IMAX network are closed, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in earnings and operating cash flows as it is generating significantly lower than normal levels of GBO-based revenue from its joint revenue sharing arrangements and digital remastering services, it is unable to provide normal maintenance services to any of the theaters that remain closed, and while some installation activity is continuing, certain theater system installations have, and may continue to be delayed. In addition, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor partners who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the theater closures. In response, the Company has provided temporary relief to exhibitor partners by waiving or reducing maintenance fees during periods when theaters are closed or operating with reduced capacities and, in certain situations, by providing extended payment terms on annual minimum payment obligations in exchange for a corresponding or longer extension of the term of the underlying sale or lease arrangement.\nBased on the Company's current cash balances and operating cash flows, management expects to have sufficient capital and liquidity to fund its anticipated operating needs and capital requirements during the twelve month period following the date of this report. However, as discussed above, the risk of breaching the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility borrowings would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nCash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased by $207.9 million principally due to financing cash inflows of $240.6 million, which include the full draw of the Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020, as discussed above. These financing cash inflows are partially offset by $23.0 million of cash used to fund the Company's operating activities as the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decline in revenue and earnings. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company invested $9.3 million in equipment to be used in its joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitors, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Based on management's current operating plan for 2021, the Company expects to continue to use cash to deploy additional IMAX Theater Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company's net cash used in or provided by operating activities is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) the level of cash collections from customers in respect of existing IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements, (ii) the amount of upfront payments collected from newly signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements, (iii) the box-office performance of films distributed by the Company and/or released to IMAX theaters, (iv) the level of inventory purchases and (v) the level of the Company's operating expenses, including expenses for research and development and new business initiatives.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net cash outflow from operating activities is principally due to the significant decrease in the Company's revenue and earnings as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $66.0 million) which includes $6.7 million (2019 - $40.5 million) invested in equipment to be used in the Company's joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitors. In addition, the Company acquired $1.9 million (2019 - $2.9 million) of intangible assets, principally related to the purchase of internal use software, and purchased $0.7 million in property, plant and equipment (2019 - $7.4 million). Furthermore, in the year ended December 31, 2019, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China purchased equity securities in Maoyan for $15.2 million. No investments of equity securities occurred in 2020.\nCapital expenditures, including the Company's investment in joint revenue sharing equipment, purchase of property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets and investments in film assets were $16.9 million in 2020 as compared to $74.3 million in 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash used of $57.1 million in 2019. In 2020, the net cash provided by financing activities was principally due to $280.0 million in Credit Facility borrowings drawn in the first quarter of 2020, as discussed above, and $7.6 million drawn on IMAX Shanghai's Working Capital Facility, partially offset by $36.6 million paid to repurchase common shares under the Company's share repurchase program, $3.6 million paid to purchase treasury stock for the settlement of restricted share units and related taxes, $1.5 million for the repurchase of common shares under the IMAX China share repurchase program, $4.2 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling interest shareholders of IMAX China and $1.1 million in Credit Facility amendment fees.\nIn 2019, the net cash used in financing activities was principally due to the net repayment of $20.0 million in Credit Facility borrowings, $19.2 million for the repurchase of common shares under the IMAX China share repurchase program, $14.4 million paid to purchase treasury stock for the settlement of restricted share units and related taxes, $4.4 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling interest shareholders of IMAX China, and $2.7 million paid to repurchase common shares under the Company's share repurchase program, partially offset by $2.4 million common shares issued for stock options exercised and $1.1 million received for the issuance of subsidiary shares to non-controlling interests.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nPayments to be made by the Company under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands of U.S. Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\nObligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1 to 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3 to 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,348\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 35,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pension obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,298\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Credit Facility(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working Capital Facility\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,643\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Postretirement benefits obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,299\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,635\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 388,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 46,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 325,836\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents total payments to be made under binding commitments with suppliers and outstanding payments to be made for supplies ordered, but yet to be invoiced.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> The Company has an unfunded defined benefit pension plan, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP\u201d), covering its CEO, Mr. Richard L.

SERP benefit payments to Mr. Gelfond are subject to a deferral for six months after the termination of his employment, at which time Mr. Gelfond will be entitled to receive interest on the deferred amount credited at the applicable federal rate for short-term obligations. Pursuant to an amendment to his employment agreement dated November 1, 2019, the term of Mr. Gelfond's employment was extended through December 31, 2022, although Mr. Gelfond has not informed the Company that he intends to retire at that time. Under the terms of this amendment to his employment agreement, the total benefit payable to Mr. Gelfond under the SERP was fixed at $20.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the present value of the related SERP benefit obligation of approximately $20.1 million recorded within Accrued and Other Liabilities (December 31, 2019 - $18.8 million).\nThe Company has a postretirement plan to provide health and welfare benefits to Canadian employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an unfunded benefit obligation of $1.9 million within Accrued and Other Liabilities related to this plan (December 31, 2019 - $1.6 million).\nIn July 2000, the Company agreed to maintain health benefits for Messrs. Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler, the Company's former Co-CEO and current Chairman of its Board of Directors, upon retirement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an unfunded benefit obligation of $0.7 million within Accrued and Other Liabilities related to this plan (December 31, 2019 - $0.7 million).\nThe Company maintained a non-qualified deferred compensation benefit plan (the Retirement Plan\u201d) covering the former CEO of IMAX Entertainment and Senior Executive Vice President of the Company. Under the terms of the Retirement Plan, the benefits were due to vest in full if the executive incurred a separation from service from the Company (as defined therein). In the fourth quarter of 2018, the executive incurred a separation from service from the Company, and as such, the Retirement Plan benefits became fully vested as of December 31, 2018 and the accelerated costs were recognized and reflected in Executive Transition Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the benefit obligation related to the Retirement Plan was $3.7 million (December 31, 2019 - $3.6 million) and is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and Other Liabilities. As the Retirement Plan is fully vested, the benefit obligation is measured at the present value of the benefits expected to be paid in the future with the accretion of interest recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Retirement Benefits Non-Service Expenses.\nThe Retirement Plan is funded by an investment in company-owned life insurance ( COLI\u201d), which is recorded at its fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Prepaid Expenses. As of December 31, 2020, fair value of the COLI asset was $3.2 million (December 31, 2019 - $3.2 million). Gains and losses resulting from changes in the cash surrender value of the COLI asset are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Gain (Loss) In Fair Value of Investments.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nThere are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nGAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In this report, the Company presents financial measures in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its performance:\nTable 138: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> EBITDA; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share exclude, where applicable: (i) share-based compensation; (ii) COVID-19 government relief benefits; (iii) legal judgment and arbitration awards; (iv) exit costs, restructuring charges and associated impairments; (v) loss in the fair value of investments, as well as the related tax impact of these adjustments, and (vi) income taxes resulting from management's decision to no longer indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures that allow management and users of the Company's financial statements to view operating trends and analyze controllable operating performance on a comparable basis between periods without the after-tax impact of share-based compensation and certain unusual items included in net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the Company's employee and executive compensation packages, it is a non-cash expense and is excluded from certain internal business performance measures.\nA reconciliation from net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts to adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share is presented in the table below. Net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts are the most directly comparable GAAP measures because they reflect the earnings relevant to the Company's shareholders, rather than the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to reflect this approach.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td>

As a result, the calculated tax impact as a percentage of the related non-GAAP adjustments is lower than in the prior year.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, management also uses EBITDA,\u201d as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, and which is referred to herein as Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility.\u201d As allowed by the Credit Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility includes adjustments in addition to the exclusion of interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is presented to allow a more comprehensive analysis of the Company's operating performance and to provide additional information with respect to the Company's compliance against its Credit Agreement requirements, when applicable. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility presents relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company's industry to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's results.\nEBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (i) interest expense, net of interest income; (ii) income tax expense or benefit; and (iii) depreciation and amortization, including film asset amortization. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is defined as EBITDA excluding: (i) share-based and other non-cash compensation; (ii) gain or loss in the fair value of investments; (iii) write-downs, net of recoveries, including asset impairments and credit loss expense; (iv) legal judgment and arbitration awards; and (iv) the gain or loss from equity accounted investments.\nA reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is presented in the table below. Net loss attributable to common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure because it reflects the earnings relevant to the Company's shareholders, rather than the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to reflect this approach.\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Attributable to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-controlling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less: Attributable to\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Interests and\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Non-controlling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Attributable to\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Interests\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Common Shareholders\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands of U.S. Dollars)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Reported net loss\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (157,486\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,711\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (143,775\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Add (subtract):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,408\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net of interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (370\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization, including film asset amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 53,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 49,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (73,656\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (4,103\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (69,553\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Share-based and other non-cash compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss in fair value of investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Write-downs, including asset impairments and credit loss expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,337\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal judgment and arbitration awards\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,105\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from equity accounted investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,858\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7,237\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,860\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (13,097\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is calculated using twelve months ended Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility.

of IMAX Theater System arrangements in backlog as of December 31, 2020 are scheduled to be installed in international markets (2019 - 73.6%).\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of the year and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. These indicators could include a decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization, a significant change in the outlook for the reporting unit's business, lower than expected operating results, increased competition, legal factors, or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. For reporting units with goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management's current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

During previous adverse events and downturns in the cinema business, the Company fostered many of the innovations that helped enable its global growth in recent years, including the development of its proprietary DMR process and the creation of its joint-revenue sharing business model.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, in response to uncertainties associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its impact on the Company's business, the Company drew down $280.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> December 31, 2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> IMAX Theater System Backlog\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Traditional\nJRSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Hybrid\nJRSA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Sale / Lease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domestic Total (United States & Canada)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Greater China\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asia (excluding Greater China)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Western Europe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Russia & the CIS\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Latin America\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rest of the World\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> International Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Worldwide Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLegal Judgment and Arbitration Awards\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (In thousands of U.S. Dollars, except number of systems)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nSystems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Number of\nSystems\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> New IMAX Theater Systems -

See below for separate discussions of IMAX DMR and JRSA contingent rent results for the year.\nIn 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASC Topic 326\u201d), which amends previously issued guidance regarding the impairment of financial instruments by creating an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The standard requires financial assets measured on the amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The Company's accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables are within the scope of ASU No. 2016-13. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 and several associated ASUs on January 1, 2020 with no required cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. (See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe Company also intends to continue research and development in other areas considered important to the Company's continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of its projectors, certifying more IMAX cameras, enhancing the Company's image quality, expanding the applicability of the Company's digital technology in both theater and home entertainment and improvements to the DMR process.\nThe Company develops its estimate of credit losses by class of receivable and customer type through a calculation that utilizes historical loss rates which are then adjusted for specific receivables that are judged to have a higher than normal risk profile after taking into account management's internal credit quality classifications, as well as macro-economic and industry risk factors.\nTable 125: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

taken and is continuing to take significant steps to preserve the cash by eliminating non-essential costs, placing certain employees on a temporary furlough, reducing the working hours of other employees and deferring all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels.\nThere are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition.\nIMAX Theater System arrangements also include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement in exchange for an extended warranty and annual maintenance fee, which is subject to a consumer price index increase on renewal each year. Consideration related to the provision of maintenance services is included in the allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the arrangement at contract inception, as discussed in more detail below. The Company's maintenance services are a stand ready obligation and, as a result, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term.\n \u2022 advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater; \n\nGreater China is the Company's largest market, measured by revenues, with approximately 38% and 31% of overall revenues generated from its China operations in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

includes the projector, sound system, screen system and, if applicable, a 3D glasses cleaning machine; (ii) services associated with the IMAX Theater System, including theater design support, the supervision of installation services, and projectionist training; and (iii) a license to use the IMAX brand to market the theater. The System Obligation, as a group, is a distinct performance obligation and a single unit of accounting. The Company is not responsible for the physical installation of the equipment in the customer's facility; however, it supervises the installation by the customer. The customer has the right to use the IMAX brand from the date the Company and the customer enter into an arrangement.\n \u2022 EBITDA; and \n \u2022 large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer's peripheral vision and creates more realistic images; \n (2) Latin America includes South America, Central America and Mexico. \nIn addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, management also uses EBITDA,\u201d as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, and which is referred to herein as Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility.\u201d As allowed by the Credit Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility includes adjustments in addition to the exclusion of interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is presented to allow a more comprehensive analysis of the Company's operating performance and to provide additional information with respect to the Company's compliance against its Credit Agreement requirements, when applicable. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility presents relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company's industry to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's results.\nVariable consideration related to the level of the customer's box office receipts is outside of the Company's control as it is dependent upon the commercial success of film content in future periods. The Company tracks numerous performance statistics for box office performance in regions worldwide and applies its understanding of these theater markets to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration to be earned over the term of the arrangement. The Company then applies a constraint to this estimate by reducing the projection by a percentage factor for theaters or markets with no or limited historical box office experience. In cases where direct historical experience can be observed, average experience, eliminating significant outliers, is used. The resulting amount of variable consideration is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using a risk-weighted discount rate.\nThe Company stratifies its employees into homogeneous groups in order to calculate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Binomial Model. As a result, ranges of assumptions are used for the expected life of the option. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior within the Binomial Model and various groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are grouped together for valuation purposes. The expected volatility rate is estimated based on a blended volatility method which takes into consideration the Company's historical share price volatility, the Company's implied volatility which is determined in reference to observed current market prices for the Company's traded options and the Company's peer group volatility.\n \u2022 The amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity's influence; \nThe following tables provide detailed information about IMAX Theater System signings and installations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n \u2022 the ability to exhibit content that has undergone the IMAX DMR\u00ae conversion process, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences; \nThe Company records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory based upon management's judgments regarding future events and business conditions, including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts, contracts in negotiation, technological developments, growth prospects within the customers' ultimate marketplace and anticipated market acceptance of the Company's current and pending theater systems.\n (3) Represents the total minimum annual rental payments due under the Company's operating leases, almost entirely consisting of rent at the Company's leased office space in New York. \nThe comparison to the prior year is significantly influenced by COVID-19 government relief that the Company became entitled to receive during the year under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program and the U.S. CARES Act, of which $6.0 million was recognized in 2020 as a reduction to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Also impacting the comparison to the prior year are management's cost control efforts and lower business activity amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic resulting in lower staff costs, travel, facilities and marketing related expenses, among others. These factors are partially offset by a $19.6 million (38%) decrease in labor and other costs capitalized to inventory, film assets, and joint venture theater equipment or allocated to costs applicable to revenues, due to the lower level of production during the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nIMAX Theater Systems\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include net deferred income tax assets of $18.0 million, net of a valuation allowance of $28.8 million (December 31, 2019 - $23.9 million, net of a valuation allowance of $0.2 million).\nIMAX Enhanced global device partners include Sony Electronics, Hisense, TCL, Phillips, Xiaomi, Sound United among others. By March 2021, IMAX Enhanced will have over six million certified devices in-market. IMAX Enhanced content is now available on six streaming platforms worldwide, with partners that include Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Huayi Brothers, Bona Film Group, Tencent Video, iQIYI and FandangoNOW, with more on the way.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $66.0 million) which includes $6.7 million (2019 - $40.5 million) invested in equipment to be used in the Company's joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitors. In addition, the Company acquired $1.9 million (2019 - $2.9 million) of intangible assets, principally related to the purchase of internal use software, and purchased $0.7 million in property, plant and equipment (2019 - $7.4 million). Furthermore, in the year ended December 31, 2019, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China purchased equity securities in Maoyan for $15.2 million. No investments of equity securities occurred in 2020.\nThe IMAX Systems segment provides IMAX Theater Systems to exhibitors through sale arrangements or long-term lease arrangements that for accounting purposes are classified as sales-type leases. Under these arrangements, in exchange for providing the IMAX Theater System, the Company earns initial fees and ongoing consideration (which can include fixed annual minimum payments and contingent fees in excess of the minimum payments), as well as maintenance and extended warranty fees (see IMAX Maintenance\u201d below). The initial fees vary depending on the system configuration and location of the theater. Initial fees are paid to the Company in installments between the time of signing the arrangement and the time of system installation, which is when the total of these fees, in addition to the present value of future annual minimum payments, are recognized as revenue. Finance income is recognized over the term of a financed sale or sales-type lease arrangement. In addition, in sale arrangements, an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded, is recorded as revenue in the period when the sale is recognized and is adjusted in future periods based on actual results and changes in estimates. Such variable consideration is only recognized on sales transactions to the extent the Company believes there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal.\nLong-lived assets are grouped and reviewed for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In such situations, long-lived assets are considered impaired when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying value of the asset (or asset group). In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is written down to its fair value, which is the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Factors that are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include a current expectation that it is more likely than not that the long-lived asset will be sold significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant decrease in the market price of the long-lived asset, and a significant change in the extent or manner in which the long-lived asset is being used.\nAsset Impairments\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and recorded a $23.7 million valuation allowance to reduce the value of deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company increased the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by $4.9 million due to additional losses recorded in the period. The valuation allowance is expected to reverse when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from the tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nDue to the COVID-19 global pandemic, substantially all of the theaters in the IMAX network were closed for a significant portion of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, stay-at-home orders were lifted in many countries and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened with reduced capacities, physical distancing requirements, and other safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, 71% of the theaters in the commercial multiplex network spanning 41 countries were open, including 44% of the theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) locations, 97% of the theaters in Greater China and 53% of the theaters in Rest of World markets. In many parts of Asia, audiences have returned to theaters, particularly IMAX theaters, in numbers consistent with pre-pandemic attendance levels despite the continued delay of Hollywood theatrical releases, which typically account for 70% of box office ticket sales in those regions. Management believes this indicates that moviegoers are eager to return to cinemas where and when theaters are open and moviegoers feel safe. However, ticket sales have been significantly lower than normal levels in theaters outside of Asia as Hollywood movie studios have further delayed the theatrical release dates for a number of films. As a result, certain theater chains have remained closed or have reduced their operating hours. In addition, theaters in major markets remain temporarily closed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $26.5 million (2019 - $16.8 million), which includes a $28.6 million valuation allowance recorded in 2020. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. At the point in time when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized, the $28.6 million valuation allowance recorded in 2020 is expected to reverse. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\nThe fair value of RSU awards is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(See Note 17(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Company's stock options.)\nPlease see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their impact on the Company's financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $10.8 million in impairment losses principally to write-down the carrying value of certain documentary, alternative content film assets and DMR related film assets due to a decrease in projected box office totals and related revenues based on management's regular quarterly recoverability assessments. As of December 31, 2020, following the recording of these write-downs, the Company's film assets totaled $5.8 million, which principally consists of DMR and documentary content. There can be no assurances that there will not be additional write-downs to the carrying values of these assets as the Company continues to assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\n \u2022 The uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time; \nPayments to be made by the Company under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nThe Retirement Plan is funded by an investment in company-owned life insurance ( COLI\u201d), which is recorded at its fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Prepaid Expenses. As of December 31, 2020, fair value of the COLI asset was $3.2 million (December 31, 2019 - $3.2 million). Gains and losses resulting from changes in the cash surrender value of the COLI asset are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Gain (Loss) In Fair Value of Investments.\nIMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as IMAX DNA\u201d. Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience's immersion in the film and taking advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen. Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film in history, released in April 2019, was shot entirely using IMAX cameras. In 2020, Universal Pictures' 1917 was released with select scenes specifically formatted for IMAX screens, Warner Bros. Pictures' Tenet was filmed with IMAX cameras, and Warner Bros. Pictures' Wonder Woman 1984, released globally in December 2020, was partially shot with IMAX cameras. In addition, Bona Film's The Rescue, which was released in China in December 2020, has an expanded aspect ratio that is exclusive to IMAX.\nPerformance Share Units\nTogether these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive and exciting experience than a traditional theater.\n(See Risk Factors - The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there\u201d and Risk Factors - General political, social and economic conditions can affect the Company's business by reducing both revenue generated from existing IMAX Theater Systems and the demand for new IMAX Theater Systems\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nIMAX DMR and Film Distribution Services\nThe Company maintained a non-qualified deferred compensation benefit plan (the Retirement Plan\u201d) covering the former CEO of IMAX Entertainment and Senior Executive Vice President of the Company. Under the terms of the Retirement Plan, the benefits were due to vest in full if the executive incurred a separation from service from the Company (as defined therein). In the fourth quarter of 2018, the executive incurred a separation from service from the Company, and as such, the Retirement Plan benefits became fully vested as of December 31, 2018 and the accelerated costs were recognized and reflected in Executive Transition Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIMAX Maintenance\nIn addition to the level of revenues, IMAX DMR gross margin is also influenced by the costs associated with the films exhibited in the year, and can vary from year to year, particularly with respect to marketing expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, marketing expenses were $3.4 million, as compared to $22.5 million in the prior year.\nThe IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category earns revenue principally from the sale or sale-type lease of IMAX Theater Systems, as well as from the maintenance of IMAX Theater Systems. To a lesser extent, the IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category earns revenue from certain ancillary theater business activities and revenues from hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements. These activities are described in more detail below under each of their respective segments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include a deferred income tax liability of $19.1 million (December 31, 2019 - $nil).\nThe Company measures share-based compensation expense using the grant date fair value of the award, which is recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation expense is not adjusted for estimated forfeitures, but is instead adjusted when and if actual forfeitures occur.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash used of $57.1 million in 2019. In 2020, the net cash provided by financing activities was principally due to $280.0 million in Credit Facility borrowings drawn in the first quarter of 2020, as discussed above, and $7.6 million drawn on IMAX Shanghai's Working Capital Facility, partially offset by $36.6 million paid to repurchase common shares under the Company's share repurchase program, $3.6 million paid to purchase treasury stock for the settlement of restricted share units and related taxes, $1.5 million for the repurchase of common shares under the IMAX China share repurchase program, $4.2 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling interest shareholders of IMAX China and $1.1 million in Credit Facility amendment fees.\nIMAX Maintenance\nConnected Theaters\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. In conjunction with its adoption, the Company applied ASC Topic 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of the date of adoption, referred to as open contracts. IMAX Theater System sales and maintenance contracts within the existing network of open theaters and sales backlog comprise a significant majority of the Company's open contracts at any point in time. DMR arrangements where the film continues to be shown by the Company's exhibitor partners, film distribution arrangements with remaining terms, and aftermarket sales orders that have been received but for which control of the product has not yet transferred to the customer are all also considered open contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses decreased by $15.0 million (12%), when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation of $20.7 million, were $87.8 million, as compared to $102.7 million in the prior year, excluding share-based compensation of $20.8 million, representing a decrease of $14.9 million (14.5%). A portion of share-based compensation expense is recognized within Cost and Expenses Applicable to Revenue and Research and Development. (See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe Other Theater Business segment principally includes after-market sales of IMAX projection system parts and 3D glasses.\nIMAX NETWORK AND BACKLOG\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor partners who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the disruption in their normal business operations during the pandemic. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company increased its provision for current expected credit losses by $18.6 million, reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater related receivables balances and the heightened collection risk associated with certain movie studios in foreign markets. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on the Company's customers and their ability to meet their financial obligations to the Company is difficult to predict.\nIncluded in interest expense is the amortization of deferred finance costs in the amount of $0.9 million and $0.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company incurred fees of approximately $1.1 million in connection with the Credit Facility amendment, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2021. The Company's policy is to defer and amortize all the costs relating to debt financing which are paid directly to the debt provider, over the life of the debt instrument.\nFilm Distribution and Post-Production\nBased on the Company's current cash balances and operating cash flows, management expects to have sufficient capital and liquidity to fund its anticipated operating needs and capital requirements during the twelve month period following the date of this report. However, as discussed above, the risk of breaching the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility borrowings would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nThe Company remains in active negotiations with all major Hollywood studios for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate for the IMAX network. However, as a result of the theater closures associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, Hollywood movie studios have postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films have been released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. Accordingly, as of the filing of this report, there remains uncertainty around the release dates of certain major films.\n (2) Includes 144 new IMAX with Laser projection system configurations and 92 upgrades of existing locations to IMAX with Laser projection system configurations. \nIn late January 2020, in response to the public health risks associated with COVID-19, the Chinese government directed exhibitors in China to temporarily close more than 70,000 movie theaters, including all of the approximately 700 IMAX theaters in mainland China. On March 11, 2020, due to the worsening public health crisis associated with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and in the following weeks, local, state and national governments instituted stay-at-home orders and restrictions on large public gatherings which caused movie theaters in countries around the world to temporarily close, including substantially all of the IMAX theaters in those countries. As a result of the theater closures, movie studios postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films were released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. More recently, stay-at-home orders have been lifted in many countries and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened in the third quarter of 2020 with reduced capacities, physical distancing requirements, and other safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, 71% of the theaters in the IMAX commercial multiplex network were open, spanning 41 countries. This included 44% of the theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) locations, 97% of the theaters in Greater China and 53% of the theaters in Rest of World markets. In many parts of Asia, audiences have returned to theaters, particularly IMAX theaters, in numbers consistent with pre-pandemic attendance levels despite the continued delay of Hollywood theatrical releases, which typically account for 70% of box office ticket sales in those regions. Management believes this indicates that moviegoers are eager to return to cinemas where and when theaters are open and moviegoers feel safe. However, ticket sales have been significantly lower than normal levels in theaters outside of Asia as Hollywood movie studios have further delayed the theatrical release dates for a number of films. As a result, certain theater chains have remained closed or have reduced their operating hours. In addition, theaters in major markets remain temporarily closed.\nTo be certified, leading consumer electronics manufacturers spanning 4K/8K televisions, projectors, A/V receivers, loudspeakers, subwoofers and soundbars must meet a carefully prescribed set of audio and video performance standards, set by a certification committee of IMAX and DTS engineers and some of Hollywood's leading technical specialists.\nThe repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the Company's revenues, earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 as GBO results from theater exhibitors declined significantly, the installation of certain Theater Systems was delayed, and maintenance services were generally suspended for theaters that were closed. During time periods when there is a lack of new films released by movie studios and a significant number of theaters in the IMAX network are closed, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in earnings and operating cash flows as it is generating significantly lower than normal levels of GBO-based revenue from its joint revenue sharing arrangements and digital remastering services, it is unable to provide normal maintenance services to any of the theaters that remain closed, and while some installation activity is continuing, certain theater system installations have, and may continue to be delayed. In addition, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor partners who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the theater closures. In response, the Company has provided temporary relief to exhibitor partners by waiving or reducing maintenance fees during periods when theaters are closed or operating with reduced capacities and, in certain situations, by providing extended payment terms on annual minimum payment obligations in exchange for a corresponding or longer extension of the term of the underlying sale or lease arrangement.\nUnder certain other joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX Theater System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. As with a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the customer also pays the Company a percentage of contingent box office receipts over the term of the arrangement, although this percentage is typically half that of a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, while the fixed upfront payment is recorded as revenue within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a sale, see the discussion below under IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance.\nRevenues associated with both IMAX DMR and Film Distribution arrangements qualify for the variable consideration exemption for sales- or usage-based royalties in ASC Topic 606 and are recognized in the period when the corresponding box office sales occur.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company's capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. As a result, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $19.1 million for the year for the estimated applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with these historical earnings, which will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management's judgments, assumptions, and estimates are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors that are believed to be reasonable as of the date of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may ultimately differ from the Company's original estimates, as future events and circumstances sometimes do not develop as expected, and the differences may be material. Management believes that the following are the Company's most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are not ranked in any particular order, that may affect the Company's reported results of operations and/or financial condition. The Company's other significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Contingent Rent\nThe introduction of joint revenue sharing arrangements has been an important factor in the expansion of the Company's commercial theater network. Joint revenue sharing arrangements allow commercial theater exhibitors to install IMAX Theater Systems without the significant initial capital investment required in a sale or sales-type lease arrangement. Joint revenue sharing arrangements drive recurring cash flows and earnings for the Company, as customers under joint revenue sharing arrangements pay the Company a portion of their ongoing box office. The Company funds its joint revenue sharing arrangements through cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 890 theaters in operation under joint revenue sharing arrangements, a 2.3% increase as compared to the 870 theaters in operation under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2019. The Company also had contracts in backlog for 342 theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2020, including 87 upgrades to existing theater locations and 255 new theater locations.\nIMAX is one of the world's leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in technological innovations powering the presentation of some of today's most immersive entertainment experiences. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution to create the highest quality, most immersive motion picture and other entertainment event experiences for which the IMAX\u00ae brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and movie studios utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and, as a result, IMAX's network is among the most important and successful distribution platforms for major films and other events around the world.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 276 (2019 - 277) of the 750 (2019 - 731) theaters under traditional joint revenue sharing arrangements in operation, or 36.8% (2019 - 37.9%) were located in the United States or Canada, with the remaining 474 (2019 - 454) or 63.2% (2019 - 62.1%) of theaters under traditional joint revenue sharing arrangements located in international markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Maintenance revenue and gross margin decreased by $31.2 million (59%) and $19.9 million (87%), respectively, as maintenance revenue was not recognized during the periods of time when theaters were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company incurred fees of approximately $1.1 million in connection with the Amendment, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2021.\n\nCertain of the Company's contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type during the term or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing but before installation. Current backlog information reflects all known elections.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance revenue and gross margin decreased by $100.1 million (56%) and $58.4 million (68%), respectively, when compared to the prior year as the pace of theater system installations slowed significantly and maintenance revenue was not recognized for theaters that remained closed during the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above. See below for separate discussions of IMAX Systems and IMAX Maintenance results for the year.\n \u2022 The entity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price concessions or changing the payment terms and conditions of similar contracts in similar circumstances. \nThe Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content, especially during periods between peak and off-peak seasons, known as \"shoulder periods\".\nIMAX Technology Network results are influenced by the level of commercial success and box office performance of the films released to the network, as well as other factors including the timing of the films released, the length of the theatrical distribution window, the take rates under the Company's DMR and joint revenue sharing arrangements and the level of marketing spend associated with the films released in the year. Other factors impacting IMAX Technology Network results include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies versus the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company has a postretirement plan to provide health and welfare benefits to Canadian employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an unfunded benefit obligation of $1.9 million within Accrued and Other Liabilities related to this plan (December 31, 2019 - $1.6 million).\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company utilizes a lattice-binomial option-pricing model ( Binomial Model\u201d) to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date. The fair value determined by the Binomial Model is affected by the Company's stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Binomial Model also considers the expected exercise multiple which is the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Company's employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, in management's opinion, the Binomial Model best provides a fair measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options.\nIn a Film Distribution arrangement, the Company licenses film content and distributes large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company's Film Distribution revenues are strictly from the license of its intellectual property in the form of documentary film content to which the Company holds exclusive distribution rights.\nThe IMAX Technology Network category earns revenue based on contingent box office receipts and includes the IMAX DMR segment and contingent rent from the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement ( JRSA\u201d) segment, as described in more detail below.\nSOURCES OF REVENUE\nThe following table provides detailed information about the Company's backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nWorking Capital Facility\nThe amount and timing of compensation expense recognized for PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is dependent upon management's assessment of the likelihood and timing of achieving these targets. If, as a result of management's assessment, it is projected that a greater number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to increase compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if, as a result of management's assessment, it is projected that a lower number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to decrease compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Contingent Rent\nThe Company grants two types of PSU awards, one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain EBITDA-based targets and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain stock-price targets. These awards vest over a three-year performance period. The grant date fair value of PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is equal to the closing price on the date of grant or the average closing price of the Company's common stock for five days prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs with stock-price targets is determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a valuation model that takes into account the likelihood of achieving the stock-price targets embedded in the award ( Monte Carlo Model\u201d). The compensation expense attributable to each type of PSU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. At the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from 0% to a maximum vesting opportunity of 175% of the initial award, depending upon actual performance versus the established EBITDA and stock-price targets.\n (2) Principally includes after-market sales of IMAX projection system parts and 3D glasses. \nIMAX Technology Network\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nCash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net cash outflow from operating activities is principally due to the significant decrease in the Company's revenue and earnings as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nThe estimates used in the Company's goodwill impairment tests and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. If business conditions deteriorate further, or should they remain depressed for a more prolonged period of time, management's estimates of operating results and future cash flows for the IMAX Systems and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements reporting units may be insufficient to support the goodwill assigned to them, thus requiring impairment charges. The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment.\nThe recognition of variable consideration involves a significant amount of judgment. Variable consideration is recognized subject to appropriate constraints to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in future periods. The Company reviews its variable consideration assets on at least a quarterly basis. ASC Topic 606 identifies several examples of situations when constraining variable consideration is appropriate:\nFor the purposes of MD&A the Company has organized its reportable segments into the following four categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; (iii) New Business Initiatives; and (iv) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these four categories are the Company's following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements; (iii) IMAX Systems; (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) New Business Initiatives; (vii) Film Distribution; and (viii) Film Post-Production. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated certain financial statement line descriptions (with no change to the classification of amounts) within Revenues and Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues in its Consolidated Statements of Operations to better describe the nature of its revenue-generating activities and related costs.\n (1) Period-to-period changes in the tables above are reported net of the effect of permanently closed theaters. \nAs a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience\u00ae, the Company's exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box office for the Company's exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films.\n (1) Greater China includes China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. \nIMAX Theater System arrangements are non-cancellable unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. In the absence of a material default by the Company, there is no right to any remedy for the customer under the Company's arrangements. If a material default by the Company exists, the customer has the right to terminate the arrangement and seek a refund only if the customer provides notice to the Company of a material default and only if the Company does not cure the default within a specified period.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company's reportable segments are organized into the following four categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; (iii) New Business Initiatives; and (iv) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these categories are the Company's following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements; (iii) IMAX Systems, (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) New Business Initiatives; (vii) Film Distribution; and (viii) Film Post-Production, each of which are described above under Sources of Revenue.\u201d This categorization is consistent with how the CODM reviews the financial performance of the Company and makes strategic decisions regarding resource allocation and investments to meet long-term business goals. Management believes that a discussion and analysis based on the four categories listed above is significantly more relevant and useful to readers, as the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations captions combine results from several segments.\nThe Company's business and future prospects are evaluated by Richard L. Gelfond, its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d), using a variety of factors and financial and operational metrics including: (i) the signing, installation and financial performance of theater system arrangements, particularly joint revenue sharing arrangements and those involving laser-based projection systems; (ii) film performance and the securing of new film projects, particularly IMAX DMR films; (iii) the continuing ability to invest in and improve the Company's technology to enhance the differentiation of The IMAX Experience versus other cinematic experiences; (iv) revenues and gross margins earned by the Company's segments, as discussed below; (v) consolidated earnings from operations, as adjusted for unusual items; (vi) the overall execution, reliability and consumer acceptance of The IMAX Experience; (vii) the success of new business initiatives; and (viii) short- and long-term cash flow projections.\n\nUnder most joint revenue sharing arrangements (both traditional and hybrid), the initial non-cancellable term is 10 years or longer and is renewable by the customer for one to two additional terms of between three to five years. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are non-cancellable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations.\nManagement is encouraged by recent box office results in markets like China, Japan and South Korea where the virus is under control and audiences have demonstrated a willingness to return to cinema. However, the Company may continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic even after a significant portion or all theaters are reopened. The global economic impact of COVID-19 has led to record levels of unemployment in certain countries, which has led to, and may continue to result in lower consumer spending. The timing and extent of a recovery of consumer behavior and willingness to spend discretionary income on movie-going may delay the Company's ability to generate significant GBO-based revenue until consumer behavior normalizes and consumer spending recovers.\nIn July 2000, the Company agreed to maintain health benefits for Messrs. Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler, the Company's former Co-CEO and current Chairman of its Board of Directors, upon retirement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an unfunded benefit obligation of $0.7 million within Accrued and Other Liabilities related to this plan (December 31, 2019 - $0.7 million).\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum; or (ii) the U.S. base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% per annum, in each case depending on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement); provided, however, that from the effective date of the Amendment until the Company delivers a compliance certificate under the Credit Facility following the end of the Designated Period, the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings will be 2.50% per annum and the applicable margin for U.S. base rate borrowings will be 1.75% per annum. The effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.38% (2019 - 3.43%).\nThe Company has an unfunded defined benefit pension plan, the SERP, covering the Company's CEO, Mr. Gelfond. Under the terms of the SERP, if Mr. Gelfond's employment is terminated other than for cause (as defined in his employment agreement), he is entitled to receive SERP benefits in the form of a lump sum payment. SERP benefit payments to Mr. Gelfond are subject to a deferral for six months after the termination of his employment, at which time Mr. Gelfond will be entitled to receive interest on the deferred amount credited at the applicable federal rate for short-term obligations. Pursuant to an amendment to his employment agreement dated November 1, 2019, the term of Mr. Gelfond's employment was extended through December 31, 2022, although Mr. Gelfond has not informed the Company that he intends to retire at that time. Under the terms of this amendment to his employment agreement, the total benefit payable to Mr. Gelfond under the SERP was fixed at $20.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the present value of the related SERP benefit obligation of approximately $20.1 million recorded within Accrued and Other Liabilities (December 31, 2019 - $18.8 million).\n (1) Includes initial upfront payments and the present value of fixed minimum payments from sale and sales-type lease arrangements of IMAX Theater Systems, and the present value of estimated variable consideration from sales of IMAX Theater Systems. To a lesser extent, also includes finance income associated with these revenue streams. \nWithin the Credit Facility, the Company is able to purchase foreign currency forward contracts and/or other swap arrangements. The net settlement gain on its foreign currency forward contracts was $2.0 million at December 31, 2020, as the fair value of the forward contracts exceeded the notional value (December 31, 2019 - $0.5 million). As of December 31, 2020, the Company has $31.9 million in notional value of such arrangements outstanding (December 31, 2019 - $36.1 million).\nThe Company is also experimenting with new technologies and new content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, which includes curating unique, differentiated alternative content to be exhibited in IMAX theaters, particularly during those periods when Hollywood blockbuster film content is not available.\nOn June 10, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d), which, among other things, (i) suspends the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant through the first quarter of 2021, (ii) re-establishes the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant thereafter, provided that for subsequent quarters that such covenant is tested, as applicable, the Company will be permitted to use its quarterly EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in lieu of the EBITDA for the corresponding quarters of 2020, (iii) adds a $75.0 million minimum liquidity covenant measured at the end of each calendar month and (iv) restricts the Company's ability to make certain restricted payments, dispositions and investments, create or assume liens and incur debt that would otherwise have been permitted by the Credit Agreement. The modifications to the negative covenants, the minimum liquidity covenant and modifications to certain other provisions in the Credit Agreement pursuant to the Amendment were effective from the date of the Amendment until the earlier of the delivery of the compliance certificate for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the date on which the Company, in its sole discretion, elects to calculate its compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio by using either its actual EBITDA or annualized EBITDA (the Designated Period\u201d).\n (3) Period-to-period changes in the tables above are reported net of the effect of permanently closed theaters. \nIn addition to the level of revenues, JRSA margin is also influenced by the level of costs associated with such arrangements, such as depreciation expense related to the underlying Theater Systems and costs incurred to upgrade Theater Systems from digital xenon to IMAX with Laser, as well as advertising, marketing and commission costs primarily for the launch of new theaters. The level of depreciation expense in a year relative to the prior year is a function of the growth of the theater network and the mix of theater system configurations in the network. For the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA gross margin included depreciation expense of $24.9 million, as compared to $23.2 million in the prior year reflecting a 2% increase in the number of theaters operating under joint revenue sharing arrangements during the year and the impact of new theaters operating throughout 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA gross margin includes certain advertising, marketing and commission costs of $1.4 million, as compared to $3.3 million in the prior year.\nThe recoverability of the Company's film assets is dependent upon the commercial acceptance of the underlying films and the resulting level of box office results and, in certain situations, ancillary revenues. If management's projections of future net cash flows resulting from the exploitation of a film indicate that the carrying value of the film asset is not recoverable, the film asset is written down to its fair value.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2020 of (20.5)% differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 26.2%, primarily due to the recording of the valuation allowance discussed above, withholding taxes associated with the reversal of the indefinite reinvestment assertion for certain foreign subsidiaries, as discussed below, permanent book to tax differences, jurisdictional tax rate differences, and management's estimates of contingent liabilities related to the resolution of various tax examinations.\n(See Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\n (2) The Company has an unfunded defined benefit pension plan, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP\u201d), covering its CEO, Mr. Richard L. Gelfond. The SERP has a fixed benefit payable of $20.3 million. The table above assumes that Mr. Gelfond will receive a lump sum payment of $20.3 million six months after retirement at the end of the term of his current employment agreement, which expires on December 31, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the SERP, although Mr. Gelfond has not informed the Company that he intends to retire at that time. \nThe primary drivers of IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance results are the number of IMAX Theater Systems installed in a year, and the level of gross margin percentage earned on each installation, as well as the associated maintenance contracts that accompany each theater installation. The installation of IMAX Theater Systems in newly built theaters or multiplexes, which make up a large portion of the Company's theater system backlog, depends primarily on the timing of the construction of those projects, which is not under the Company's control.\nA reconciliation from net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts to adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share is presented in the table below. Net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts are the most directly comparable GAAP measures because they reflect the earnings relevant to the Company's shareholders, rather than the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to reflect this approach.\nThe Company's operating cash flows and cash balances will be adversely affected if management's projections of future signings of IMAX Theater Systems and film performance, theater installations and film productions are not realized. The Company forecasts its short-term liquidity requirements on a quarterly and annual basis. Since the Company's future cash flows are based on estimates and there may be factors that are outside of the Company's control (see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A), there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to fund its operations through cash flows from operations. Under the terms of the Company's typical sale and sales-type lease agreements, the Company receives substantial cash payments before the Company completes the performance of its obligations. Similarly, the Company receives cash payments for some of its film productions in advance of related cash expenditures.\nThe application of U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires management to make judgments and estimates. In addition, revenue contracts with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting.\nIMAX Systems\nRevenues from the sale of IMAX Theater Systems, the provision of maintenance services for IMAX Theater Systems, the sale of aftermarket projection system parts and 3D glasses, the conversion of film content into the IMAX DMR format, the distribution of documentary film content and the provision of post-production services are all within the scope of ASC Topic 606. The Company's joint revenue sharing revenue arrangements, with the exception of those where title of the IMAX Theater System transfers to the customer, known as hybrid sales, are not in scope of ASC Topic 606 as they are classified as leases. Similarly, any IMAX Theater System arrangements classified as sales-type leases are also excluded from ASC Topic 606.\n\nInterest expense was $7.0 million in 2020, as compared to $2.8 million in the prior year. The increase in interest expense versus the prior year is due to a higher level of Credit Facility borrowings, which were outstanding for most of the year. In the first quarter of 2020, in response to uncertainties associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its impact on the Company's business, the Company drew down $280.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million. Furthermore, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement in June 2020, primarily to suspend the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant through the first quarter of 2021. During the amendment period, the applicable margin increased by 150 basis points. The fully drawn Credit Facility coupled with the increase to the applicable margin during the amendment period has resulted in higher interest expense in current year versus prior year period. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe New Business Initiatives segment includes activities related to the exploration of new lines of business and new initiatives outside of the Company's core business, which seek to leverage its proprietary, innovative technologies, its leadership position in the entertainment technology space and its unique relationship with content creators. Such new business initiatives currently include IMAX Enhanced and Connected Theaters, as discussed below.\nThe Company has also implemented an active cash management process, which, among other things, requires senior management approval of all outgoing payments. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, the Company drew down $280.0 million in remaining available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility provided by its Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (both as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), which was then amended in June 2020 to, among other things, suspend the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant in the Credit Agreement through the first quarter of 2021 and substitute quarterly EBITDA from the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in lieu of the EBITDA for the corresponding quarters of 2020 to meet the original Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant.\nIn addition, the Credit Facility has standby fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.38% per annum, based on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio with respect to the unused portion of the Credit Facility; provided, however, that from the effective date of the Amendment until the Company delivers a compliance certificate under the Credit Facility following the end of the Designated Period, the standby fee will be 0.50% per annum.\n \u2022 advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems; \n\n (3) For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets attributable to certain jurisdictions where management cannot reliably estimate future tax liabilities within the next five years, primarily due to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a result, the calculated tax impact as a percentage of the related non-GAAP adjustments is lower than in the prior year. \n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nThe Company has developed a new home entertainment licensing and certification program called IMAX Enhanced. This initiative was launched along with audio leader DTS (an Xperi subsidiary), capitalizing on the companies' decades of combined expertise in image and sound science. IMAX Enhanced brings IMAX digitally re-mastered 4K high dynamic range (HDR) content and DTS audio technologies to premier streaming platforms and best-in-class consumer electronics devices worldwide, offering consumers high-fidelity sight and sound experiences for the home.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 1,650 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 84 countries and territories, including 1,562 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 76 institutional locations. This compares to 1,624 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 81 countries and territories as of December 31, 2019 including 1,529 commercial multiplexes, 14 commercial destinations, and 81 institutional locations. (See the table below under IMAX Network and Backlog\u201d for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.)\n\nThe IMAX Theater System provides the Company's exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits:\nIn an IMAX DMR arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a third party who owns the copyright to a film in exchange for converting the film into IMAX DMR format and distributing it through the IMAX network. In these arrangements, although the Company does not hold rights to the intellectual property in the form of the film content, it is compensated for the application of its intellectual property in the form of its patented DMR processes to create new intellectual property in the form of an IMAX DMR version of film.\n (2) The Company recognized $6.4 million in benefits from the CEWS program and $0.7 million in benefits from the U.S. CARES Act, as reductions to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ($6.0 million), Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues ($1.0 million) and Research and Development ($0.1 million) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe Company has a credit agreement, the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), as agent, and a syndicate of lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d) and are secured by first-priority security interests in substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. The facility provided by the Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d) matures on June 28, 2023.\n (1) Reflects amounts attributable to common shareholders. \nThe Company cautions users of its financial statements that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP amounts.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test considering the latest available information and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total Goodwill was $39.0 million, of which $19.1 million relates to the IMAX Systems reporting unit, $13.5 million relates to the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement reporting unit, and $6.4 million relates to the IMAX Maintenance reporting unit. The impairment test was performed on a reporting unit level by comparing each unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management's current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), as of the last day of any Fiscal Quarter (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 3.25:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit indebtedness, liens, capital expenditures, asset sales, investments and restricted payments, in each case subject to negotiated exceptions and baskets. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and event of default provisions.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company has applied for and received wage subsidies, tax credits and other financial support under COVID-19 relief legislation that has been enacted in the countries in which it operates. During 2020, the Company recognized $6.4 million in benefits from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ( CEWS\u201d) program and $0.7 million in benefits from the U.S. CARES Act, as reductions to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ($6.0 million), Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues ($1.0 million) and Research and Development ($0.1 million) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The CEWS program has been extended to June 2021. The Company will continue to review and apply for additional subsidies and credits for the remaining terms of these programs, where applicable.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures that allow management and users of the Company's financial statements to view operating trends and analyze controllable operating performance on a comparable basis between periods without the after-tax impact of share-based compensation and certain unusual items included in net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the Company's employee and executive compensation packages, it is a non-cash expense and is excluded from certain internal business performance measures.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company updated its recoverability tests of the carrying values of the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are recorded within Property, Plant and Equipment. In performing its reviews of recoverability, the Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. The cash flow estimates used in these tests are consistent with management's estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses were performed. These estimates are highly uncertain due to the COVID-19 global pandemic; therefore, management's estimated cash flows factor in a number of underlying variables and ranges of possible cash flow scenarios. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million related to the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Fixed Fees\nUnder certain joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX Theater System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, as discussed above, while the fixed upfront payment is reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance.\nThe repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the Company's revenues, earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 as gross box office ( GBO\u201d) results from the Company's theater customers declined significantly, the installation of certain theater systems was delayed, and maintenance services were generally suspended for theaters that were closed. While there continues to be a lack of new films released by movie studios and a significant number of theaters in the IMAX network are closed, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in earnings and operating cash flows as it is generating significantly lower than normal levels of GBO-based revenue from its joint revenue sharing arrangements and digital remastering services, it is unable to provide normal maintenance services to any of the theaters that remain closed, and while some installation activity is continuing, certain theater system installations have, and may continue to be delayed. In addition, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor customers who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the theater closures. In response, the Company has provided temporary relief to exhibitor customers by waiving or reducing maintenance fees during periods when theaters are closed or operating with reduced capacities and, in certain situations, by providing extended payment terms on annual minimum payment obligations in exchange for a corresponding or longer extension of the term of the underlying sale or lease arrangement. In 2020, the Company increased its provision for current expected credit losses by $18.6 million, in part reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater related accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, which management believes is primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and adequately addresses the risk of not collecting these receivables in full.\nThe Company has developed IMAX DMR, a proprietary technology that digitally remasters Hollywood films into IMAX formats. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a movie studio in exchange for converting a commercial film into IMAX DMR format and distributing it through the IMAX network. In recent years, the percentage of gross box office receipts earned in IMAX DMR arrangements has averaged approximately 12.5%, except for within Greater China, where the Company receives a lower percentage of net box office receipts for certain Hollywood films.\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. Although management believes that the Company has adequately accounted for its uncertain tax positions, tax audits can result in subsequent assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes above what was originally recognized in its financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments of $1.2 million (2019 - $nil) principally related to write-down of content-related assets which became impaired in the year. (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.).\n \u2022 The Company's experience (or other evidence) with similar types of contracts is limited, or that experience has limited predictive value; and \n (2) Includes a digital theater system relocated from a previous location. This installation is incremental to the IMAX network but full revenue for the digital system was not received. \n (1) The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX Theater System includes fixed upfront and ongoing consideration, including indexed annual minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. \n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nThe Credit Agreement has a revolving borrowing capacity of $300.0 million, and contains an uncommitted accordion feature allowing the Company to further expand its borrowing capacity to $440.0 million or greater, subject to certain conditions, depending on the mix of revolving and term loans comprising the incremental facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the benefit obligation related to the Retirement Plan was $3.7 million (December 31, 2019 - $3.6 million) and is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and Other Liabilities. As the Retirement Plan is fully vested, the benefit obligation is measured at the present value of the benefits expected to be paid in the future with the accretion of interest recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Retirement Benefits Non-Service Expenses.\nThe Company assesses the realization of deferred income tax assets and, based on all available evidence, concludes whether it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred income tax assets not considered to be realizable. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers, among other things, projections of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If management determines that sufficient negative evidence exists (for example, if the Company experiences cumulative three-year losses in a certain jurisdiction), then management will consider recording a valuation allowance against a portion or all of the deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction. If, after recording a valuation allowance, management's projections of future taxable income and other positive evidence considered in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate, it could prove more difficult to support the realization of these deferred tax assets. As a result, an additional valuation allowance could be required, which would have an adverse impact on the Company's effective income tax rate and results. Conversely, if, after recording a valuation allowance, management determines that sufficient positive evidence exists in the jurisdiction in which a valuation allowance is recorded (for example, if the Company is no longer in a three-year cumulative loss position in the jurisdiction, and management expects to have future taxable income in that jurisdiction based upon management's forecasts and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals), the Company may reverse a portion or all of the valuation allowance in that jurisdiction. In such situations, the adjustment made to the deferred tax asset would have a favorable impact on the Company's effective income tax rate and results in the period such determination was made.\nLoss in Fair Value of Investments\nBacklog\nInterest Expense\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and recorded a $23.7 million valuation allowance to reduce the value of deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company increased the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by $4.9 million due to additional losses recorded in the period. The valuation allowance is expected to reverse when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from the tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\nGAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In this report, the Company presents financial measures in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its performance:\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nThe Company's $317.4 million balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 includes $89.9 million in cash held outside of Canada (December 31, 2019-$90.1 million), of which $77.2 million was held in the People's Republic of China (the PRC\u201d) (December 31, 2019-$67.6 million). In the first quarter of 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company's capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $19.1 million for the applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with these historical earnings, which will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings.\n\nGoodwill\nThe Company currently believes that over time its commercial multiplex network could grow to approximately 3,318 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,562 operating as of December 31, 2020. The Company believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As of December 31, 2020, 72.8% of IMAX Theater Systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), an increase from 71.9% as of December 31, 2019. Revenues and gross box office derived from international markets continue to exceed revenues and gross box office from the United States and Canada. This was especially true during 2020 as the pace and extent of the reopening of IMAX theaters in Greater China amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic exceeded that of theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) and Rest of World markets. (See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above.) Risks associated with the Company's international business are outlined in Risk Factors - The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales and future growth prospects\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its requirements under the Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company's continued compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement will depend on the Company's ability to generate sufficient EBITDA to ensure compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months, which is dependent on the timing of when theaters in the IMAX network resume normal operations. The risk of breaching this covenant within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n \u2022 Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders; \nIn response to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company has taken and is continuing to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs, placing certain employees on a temporary furlough, reducing the working hours of other employees and reducing all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels.\nSignings and Installations\nThe transaction price in an IMAX Theater System arrangement is allocated to each good or service that is identified as a separate performance obligation based on estimated standalone selling prices. This allocation is based on observable prices when the Company sells the good or service separately. The Company has established standalone prices for the System Obligation and maintenance and extended warranty services, as well as for film license arrangements. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach for separate performance obligations that do not have standalone selling prices or third-party evidence of estimated standalone selling prices. The Company considers multiple factors including its historical pricing practices, product class, market competition and geography.\nIMAX Theater Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company's 53-year history. The Company's customers are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the theaters in the IMAX network, but sells or leases the IMAX Theater System along with a license to use its trademarks.\n * See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP amount. \n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nA significant portion of the Company's research and development efforts over the past several years have been focused on IMAX with Laser, the Company's laser-based projection system, which the Company believes delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThrough the Film Distribution segment, the Company licenses film content and distributes large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company receives as its distribution fee either a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the theater box office receipts and following the Company's recoupment of its costs the Company typically is entitled to receive an additional percentage of gross revenues as participation revenues. The Company released the IMAX original production, Asteroid Hunters, in October 2020.\nEquity Method Investments\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nNew Business Initiatives\nOn July 24, 2020, IMAX (Shanghai) Multimedia Technology Co., Ltd. ( IMAX Shanghai\u201d), one of the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries in China, renewed its unsecured revolving facility for up to 200.0 million Renminbi (approximately $30.6 million) to fund ongoing working capital requirements (the Working Capital Facility\u201d). The facility expires in July 2021. As of December 31, 2020, there was 49.9 million Renminbi ($7.6 million) in borrowings outstanding, 140.1 million Renminbi ($21.5 million) available for future borrowings and 10.0 million Renminbi ($1.5 million) available for letters of guarantees under the Working Capital Facility. There were no amounts drawn under the Working Capital facility at December 31, 2019. The amounts available for borrowing under the Working Capital Facility are not subject to a standby fee. The effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.31% (2019 - nil).\nVariable consideration related to indexed minimum payment increases is outside of the Company's control, but the movement in the rates is historically well documented and economic trends in inflation are easily accessible. For each contract subject to an indexed minimum payment increase, the Company estimates the most likely amount using published indices. The amount of the estimated minimum payment increase is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using the customer's implied borrowing rate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's principal sources of liquidity included: (i) its balances of cash and cash equivalents ($317.4 million, which reflects the full draw of the Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020); (ii) the anticipated collection of trade accounts receivable, which includes amounts owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements and DMR agreements with movie studios; (iii) the anticipated collection of financing receivables due in the next 12 months; and (iv) installment payments expected in the next 12 months on its existing sales and sales-type lease arrangements in backlog.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change is enacted. Investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.\nAs a result of the factors discussed in the previous paragraph, the Company's consolidated results of operations and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2020 materially declined versus the prior year with total revenues and gross margin decreasing by $258.7 million (65%) and $192.7 million (90%), respectively.\n\nThe following tables provide detailed information about the Company's backlog by arrangement type and geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nA reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is presented in the table below. Net loss attributable to common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure because it reflects the earnings relevant to the Company's shareholders, rather than the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to reflect this approach.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets\nIMAX Network\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\n \u2022 specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; and \n\nLong-Lived Assets\nCapital expenditures, including the Company's investment in joint revenue sharing equipment, purchase of property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets and investments in film assets were $16.9 million in 2020 as compared to $74.3 million in 2019.\nStock Options\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported a loss of $1.9 million due to the write-off of deferred tax assets related to an equity method investment, as compared to $nil in 2019 related to its proportionate share of equity investee results.\nConstraints on the Recognition of Variable Consideration\nThe JRSA segment provides IMAX Theater Systems to exhibitors through joint revenue sharing arrangements. Under the traditional form of these arrangements, IMAX provides the IMAX projection and sound system under a long-term lease in which the Company assumes the majority of the equipment and installation costs. In exchange for its upfront investment, the Company earns rent based on a percentage of contingent box office receipts and, in some cases, concession revenues, rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront fee or annual minimum payments. Rental payments from the customer are required throughout the term of the arrangement and are due either monthly or quarterly. The Company retains title to the IMAX Theater System equipment components throughout the lease term, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test considering the latest available information and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total Goodwill was $39.0 million, of which $19.1 million relates to the IMAX Systems reporting unit, $13.5 million relates to the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement reporting unit, and $6.4 million relates to the IMAX Maintenance reporting unit.\nIf business conditions deteriorate further, or should they remain depressed for a more prolonged period of time, management's estimates of operating results and future cash flows for the IMAX Systems and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements reporting units may be insufficient to support the goodwill assigned to them, thus requiring impairment charges. The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, estimates related to future expected credit losses and the recoverability of deferred tax assets, as well as the recoverability of joint revenue sharing equipment assets and the realization of variable consideration assets, could also be further impacted by changes in management's estimates. (see Notes 3, 5 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8).\nIMAX DMR\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share exclude, where applicable: (i) share-based compensation; (ii) COVID-19 government relief benefits; (iii) legal judgment and arbitration awards; (iv) exit costs, restructuring charges and associated impairments; (v) loss in the fair value of investments, as well as the related tax impact of these adjustments, and (vi) income taxes resulting from management's decision to no longer indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.\nIn addition, certain movies shown in IMAX theaters are filmed using proprietary IMAX film and IMAX certified digital cameras, which offer filmmakers customized guidance and a workflow process to provide further enhanced and differentiated image quality and a film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen.\nOther Theater Business\nResearch and Development\n \u2022 a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand. \nFinancing Activities\nThe following table provides detailed information about the mix of IMAX Theater System installations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its requirements under the Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company's continued compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement will depend on the Company's ability to generate sufficient EBITDA to ensure compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months, which is dependent on the timing of when theaters in the IMAX network resume normal operations. The risk of breaching this covenant within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nCredit Facility\nThe following table presents the Company's revenue and gross margin (margin loss) by category and reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n (2) Reflects contractual upfront payments. Future contingent payments are not reflected as these are based on negotiated shares of box office results. \nEBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (i) interest expense, net of interest income; (ii) income tax expense or benefit; and (iii) depreciation and amortization, including film asset amortization. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is defined as EBITDA excluding: (i) share-based and other non-cash compensation; (ii) gain or loss in the fair value of investments; (iii) write-downs, net of recoveries, including asset impairments and credit loss expense; (iv) legal judgment and arbitration awards; and (iv) the gain or loss from equity accounted investments.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company also updated its recoverability tests of the carrying values of the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are recorded within Property, Plant and Equipment. In performing its reviews of recoverability, the Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. The cash flow estimates used in these tests are consistent with management's estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses were performed. These estimates are highly uncertain due to the COVID-19 global pandemic; therefore, management's estimated cash flows factor in a number of underlying variables and ranges of possible cash flow scenarios. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million related to the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements. (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nWells Fargo Foreign Exchange Facility\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Research and Development expenses increased by $0.4 million (8%), when compared to the prior year, primarily due to costs associated with the Connected Theaters initiative.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following tables provide detailed information about the Commercial Multiplex theaters in operation within the IMAX network by arrangement type and geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe ability of the Company to collect its accounts receivable, financing receivable and variable consideration receivables is heavily dependent on the viability and solvency of individual theater operators which is significantly influenced by consumer behavior and general economic conditions. Theater operators and, in certain situations, movie studios, may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their payment obligations to the Company.\nRevenues and Gross Margin\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nFilm Distribution and Post-Production\nRestricted Share Units\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of $18.6 million reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater and studio related receivable balances, which management believes is primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and adequately addresses the risk of not collecting these receivables in full. Management's judgments regarding expected credit losses are based on the facts available to management and involve estimates about the future. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on the Company's customers and their ability to meet their financial obligations to the Company is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company's judgments and associated estimates of credit losses may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect. For the year ended December 31, 2019, credit loss expense was $2.4 million. (See Notes 2 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe Film Post-Production segment provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced by IMAX or third parties), and digital post-production services.\nThe average revenue per IMAX Theater System under sales and sales-type lease arrangements varies depending upon the number of IMAX Theater System commitments with a single respective exhibitor, an exhibitor's location and various other factors. The average revenue per full (i.e., not hybrid) IMAX Theater System under sales and sales-type lease arrangements was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a charge of $4.1 million associated with the Final Judgment issued on December 3, 2020 in respect of the Giencourt matter, as discussed in Note 16(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. No such charges were incurred in 2019.\nThe Company leverages its innovative technology and engineering in all aspects of its core business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other presentations into the IMAX format ( IMAX DMR\u201d) and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems ( IMAX Theater Systems\u201d).\nIMAX DMR\nThe Company's net cash used in or provided by operating activities is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) the level of cash collections from customers in respect of existing IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements, (ii) the amount of upfront payments collected from newly signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements, (iii) the box-office performance of films distributed by the Company and/or released to IMAX theaters, (iv) the level of inventory purchases and (v) the level of the Company's operating expenses, including expenses for research and development and new business initiatives.\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX Theater System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue.\nIn sale arrangements, title to the IMAX Theater System equipment generally transfers to the customer. However, in certain instances, the Company retains title or a security interest in the equipment until the customer has made all payments required by the agreement or until certain shipment events for the equipment have occurred. In a sales-type lease arrangement, title to the IMAX Theater System equipment remains with the Company. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX DMR revenues and gross margin decreased by $92.5 million (77%) and $64.9 million (83%), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These decreases are due to a $849.3 million (77%) reduction in GBO generated by IMAX DMR films, from $1,108.5 million to $259.2 million, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GBO was generated primarily by the exhibition of 35 films (31 new and 4 carryovers) and the re-release of classic titles, as compared to 72 films (60 new and 12 carryovers) exhibited in 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nMaintenance margins vary depending on the mix of theater system configurations in the theater network, volume-pricing related to larger relationships and the timing and the date(s) of installation and/or service.\nIncome Taxes\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe fair value determined by the Monte Carlo Model is affected by the Company's stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, market conditions as of the grant date, the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and other relevant data. The compensation expense is fixed on the date of grant based on the dollar value granted.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the non-controlling interest in the net income (loss) of IMAX China as well as the impact of non-controlling interests in the activity of its Original Film Fund subsidiary. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of the Company's subsidiaries was $13.7 million (2019 \u2500 net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $11.7 million).\nCredit Loss Expense\nIMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance\nIMAX Technology Network\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased by $207.9 million principally due to financing cash inflows of $240.6 million, which include the full draw of the Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020, as discussed above. These financing cash inflows are partially offset by $23.0 million of cash used to fund the Company's operating activities as the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decline in revenue and earnings. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company invested $9.3 million in equipment to be used in its joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitors, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Based on management's current operating plan for 2021, the Company expects to continue to use cash to deploy additional IMAX Theater Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements.\nIMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nIMAX Enhanced\nPension and Postretirement Obligations\nThe revenue earned from customers under the Company's theater system sales or lease agreements varies from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors, including the number and mix of theater system configurations sold or leased, the timing of installation of the IMAX Theater Systems, the nature of the arrangement and other factors specific to individual contracts.\nJudgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, and the amount of any required allowance for credit losses, are based on management's initial credit evaluation of the customer and the regular ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of each customer. This monitoring process includes an analysis of collections history and aging for each customer, as well as meetings on at least a monthly basis to identify credit concerns and potential changes in credit quality classification. A customer may improve their credit quality classification once a substantial payment is made on an overdue balance or when the customer has agreed to a payment plan and payments have commenced in accordance with that plan. Changes in credit quality classification are dependent upon management approval. Management's judgments with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, and the amount of any required allowance for credit losses, may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect.\n (1) Represents total payments to be made under binding commitments with suppliers and outstanding payments to be made for supplies ordered, but yet to be invoiced. \n\nThe Company evaluates each of the performance obligations in an IMAX Theater System arrangement to determine which are considered distinct, either individually or in a group, for accounting purposes and which of the deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on the applicable accounting guidance in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d ASC Topic 842, Leases,\u201d and ASC Topic 460, Guarantees\u201d.\nThe transaction price for the System Obligation consists of upfront or initial payments made before and after the final installation of the IMAX Theater System and ongoing payments throughout the term of the arrangement. The Company estimates the transaction price, including an estimate of future variable consideration, received in exchange for the goods delivered or services rendered. The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX Theater System includes indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include amounts owed by the customer based on a percentage of their box office receipts over the term of the arrangement. These contract provisions are considered to be variable consideration under ASC Topic 606. An estimate of the present value of such variable consideration is recognized as revenue upon the transfer of control of the System Obligation to the customer, subject to constraints to ensure that there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal. This estimate is based on management's box office projections for the individual theater, which are developed using historical data for the theater and, if necessary, comparable theaters and territories. Transfer of control of the System Obligation occurs at the earlier of client acceptance of the installation of the IMAX Theater System, including projectionist training, and the opening of the theater to the public.\nIMAX Systems\n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nThe Company believes that growth in international box office remains an important driver of growth for the Company. To support continued growth in international markets, the Company has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing the Company's film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local IMAX DMR releases in select markets, particularly in China. During 2019, 18 local language IMAX DMR films were released to the IMAX network, including 14 in China and one in each of Japan, South Korea, India and Russia. The blockbuster Ne Zha: The IMAX Experience was released in China in July 2019 and it is the Company's first Chinese animated local language film title. During 2020, 17 local language IMAX DMR films were released into the IMAX network, including ten in China, three in Russia, three in Japan, and one in South Korea. The Company expects to announce additional local language IMAX DMR films to be released to the IMAX network in 2021.\nFor all IMAX theaters, theater owners or operators are also responsible for paying the Company an annual maintenance and extended warranty fee. Under these arrangements, the Company provides proactive and emergency maintenance services to every theater in its network to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the theater agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA contingent rent revenue and gross margin decreased by $58.8 million (77%) and $57.9 million (120%), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These decreases are due to a $429.3 million (77%) reduction in GBO generated by theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements during the current year, from $560.3 million to $131.0 million, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, 890 theaters were operating under joint revenue sharing arrangements, as compared to 870 theaters as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 2%. However, as discussed above, a portion of the theaters in the IMAX network remain closed as of December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Systems revenue and gross margin decreased by $53.3 million (50%) and $33.4 million (57%), respectively, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases are principally the result of 28 fewer IMAX Theater System installations and 11 fewer IMAX Theater System upgrades in the current year as the pace of theater system installations slowed significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nJoint revenue sharing arrangements also require IMAX to provide maintenance and extended warranty services to the customer over the term of the lease in exchange for a separate fixed annual fee. These fees are reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below.\nThe Company issues share-based compensation to eligible employees, directors, and consultants under the IMAX Corporate Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (as may be amended, the IMAX LTIP\u201d) and the China Long-Term Incentive Plan (the China LTIP\u201d) as summarized below. On June 3, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the IMAX LTIP at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting. The IMAX LTIP is the Company's governing document and awards to employees, directors, and consultants under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted share units ( RSUs\u201d), performance share units ( PSUs\u201d) and other awards. A separate stock option plan, the China LTIP, was adopted by a subsidiary of the Company in October 2012.\nIMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited in IMAX theaters is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release of the film. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position.\nThe Company is currently exploring new technologies and forms of content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, including new technologies to further connect the IMAX network and to facilitate bringing more unique content, including live events, to IMAX theater audiences. The Company believes such additional connectivity can provide more innovative content to the IMAX network and in turn permit the Company to engage audiences in new ways.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Film Distribution and Post-Production revenue and gross margin decreased by $3.5 million (29%) and $8.9 million, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The results for the year are significantly influenced by $10.0 million in impairment losses recorded in the year principally to write-down the carrying value of certain documentary and alternative content film assets due to a decrease in projected box office totals and related revenues based on management's regular quarterly recoverability assessments. As of December 31, 2020, following the recording of these write-downs, the Company's film assets totaled $5.8 million, which principally consists of DMR and documentary content. There can be no assurances that there will not be additional write-downs to the carrying values of these assets as the Company continues to assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8).\nIn 2019, the net cash used in financing activities was principally due to the net repayment of $20.0 million in Credit Facility borrowings, $19.2 million for the repurchase of common shares under the IMAX China share repurchase program, $14.4 million paid to purchase treasury stock for the settlement of restricted share units and related taxes, $4.4 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling interest shareholders of IMAX China, and $2.7 million paid to repurchase common shares under the Company's share repurchase program, partially offset by $2.4 million common shares issued for stock options exercised and $1.1 million received for the issuance of subsidiary shares to non-controlling interests.\nThe revenue earned from customers under the Company's joint revenue sharing arrangements can vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors including film performance, the mix of theater system configurations, the timing of installation of these IMAX Theater Systems, the nature of the arrangement, the location, size and management of the theater and other factors specific to individual arrangements.\n (3) In addition to revenue from new and upgraded IMAX Theater Systems, revenues earned by the IMAX Systems segment also includes finance income and the impact of renewals and amendments to existing theater system arrangements. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. \nNBC Facility\n (1) Includes 46 IMAX Theater Systems (2019 - 47) where the customer has the option to convert from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sales arrangement. \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any letters of credit and advance payment guarantees outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nThe number of IMAX Theater Systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Theater Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues. The value of backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases and long-term conditional theater commitments. Theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements do not usually have dollar value backlog, although certain IMAX Theater Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX Theater System installations that are listed in backlog are valid and binding commitments.\nAs one of the world's leaders in entertainment technology, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. In 2018, the Company introduced IMAX with Laser, a laser projection system designed for IMAX theaters in commercial multiplexes, which represents a further evolution of IMAX's proprietary technology. The Company believes that IMAX with Laser delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that IMAX with Laser is helping facilitate the next major lease renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $(143.8) million, or $(2.43) per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $46.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported an adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders* of $(112.1) million, or $(1.89) per diluted share*, as compared to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders* of $64.8 million, or $1.05 per diluted share*, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs discussed above, the Company's significant streams of variable consideration relate to arrangements for the sale of IMAX Theater Systems which include indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include variable consideration based on a percentage of the customer's box office receipts over the term of the arrangement.\n (1) The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is calculated using twelve months ended Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Facility Agreement which provides for, among other things, the suspension of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant through the first quarter of 2021. For more information see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. \nTax reserves for uncertain tax positions are adjusted by the Company to reflect management's best estimate of the outcome of examinations and assessments and in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with the uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. Some of these adjustments require significant judgment in estimating the timing and amount of the additional tax expense.\nThe discussion of the Company's results of operations below compares results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A discussion of the Company's results of operations comparing results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is included under the section entitled Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nOn October 28, 2019, the Company entered into a $5.0 million facility with the National Bank of Canada (the NBC Facility\u201d) fully insured by Export Development Canada for use solely in conjunction with the issuance of performance guarantees and letters of credit. The Company did not have any letters of credit and advance payment guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 under the NBC Facility.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China, entered into a cornerstone investment agreement with Maoyan Entertainment ( Maoyan\u201d) and purchased equity securities for $15.2 million. These equity securities are traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the Company is required to adjust the fair value of the securities each period to reflect the current market value. This adjustment will fluctuate based on the closing market price at the end of each period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company's investment in Maoyan resulted in an unrealized loss of $2.1 million, as compared to an unrealized loss of $0.5 million in the prior year, which are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In February 2021, IMAX China (Hong Kong) sold all of its 7,949,000 shares of Maoyan for gross proceeds of $17.8 million, which represents a $2.6 million gain relative to the Company's acquisition cost. No shares of Maoyan are currently held by IMAX China (Hong Kong).\n (1) Includes 148 new IMAX with Laser projection system configurations and 95 upgrades of existing locations to IMAX with Laser projection system configurations. \nFilm Assets\n \u2022 Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share; ", "item_7_text": "The CEO is the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker ( CODM\u201d), as such term is defined under U.S. GAAP. The CODM, along with other members of management, assess segment performance based on segment revenues and gross margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses, research and development costs, the amortization of intangible assets, provisions for (recoveries of) current expected credit losses, certain write-downs, interest income, interest expense and income tax (expense) benefit are not allocated to the Company's segments.\nInvesting Activities\nApproximately 74.8% of IMAX Theater System arrangements in backlog as of December 31, 2020 are scheduled to be installed in international markets (2019 - 73.6%).\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested annually for impairment at the reporting unit level in the fourth quarter of the year and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist. These indicators could include a decline in the Company's stock price and market capitalization, a significant change in the outlook for the reporting unit's business, lower than expected operating results, increased competition, legal factors, or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. For reporting units with goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management's current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes.\nAssessment of Liquidity and Capital Requirements\nAsset Impairments\nUncertain Tax Positions\nThe following table provides detailed information about the IMAX network by type and geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nIn addition, the Company has been, and intends to continue, using time and resources during the business slowdown caused by the COVID-19 global pandemic to work on leveraging and developing technologies and systems to help bring additional interactivity to its theater network, better manage certain of the Company's internal workflows and better organize and codify certain of the Company's data. During previous adverse events and downturns in the cinema business, the Company fostered many of the innovations that helped enable its global growth in recent years, including the development of its proprietary DMR process and the creation of its joint-revenue sharing business model.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, in response to uncertainties associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its impact on the Company's business, the Company drew down $280.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million.\nLegal Judgment and Arbitration Awards\nInventories\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Technology Network revenues and gross margin decreased by $151.3 million (77%) and $(122.8) million (97%), respectively, when compared to the prior year principally due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above. See below for separate discussions of IMAX DMR and JRSA contingent rent results for the year.\nIn 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d ( ASC Topic 326\u201d), which amends previously issued guidance regarding the impairment of financial instruments by creating an impairment model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The standard requires financial assets measured on the amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. The Company's accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables are within the scope of ASU No. 2016-13. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-13 and several associated ASUs on January 1, 2020 with no required cumulative-effect adjustment to accumulated deficit. (See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe Company also intends to continue research and development in other areas considered important to the Company's continued commercial success, including further improving the reliability of its projectors, certifying more IMAX cameras, enhancing the Company's image quality, expanding the applicability of the Company's digital technology in both theater and home entertainment and improvements to the DMR process.\nThe Company develops its estimate of credit losses by class of receivable and customer type through a calculation that utilizes historical loss rates which are then adjusted for specific receivables that are judged to have a higher than normal risk profile after taking into account management's internal credit quality classifications, as well as macro-economic and industry risk factors.\nIn response to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company has taken and is continuing to take significant steps to preserve the cash by eliminating non-essential costs, placing certain employees on a temporary furlough, reducing the working hours of other employees and deferring all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels.\nThere are currently no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on the Company's financial condition.\nIMAX Theater System arrangements also include a requirement for the Company to provide maintenance services over the life of the arrangement in exchange for an extended warranty and annual maintenance fee, which is subject to a consumer price index increase on renewal each year. Consideration related to the provision of maintenance services is included in the allocation of the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the arrangement at contract inception, as discussed in more detail below. The Company's maintenance services are a stand ready obligation and, as a result, are recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract term.\n \u2022 advanced sound system components, which deliver more expansive sound imagery and pinpointed origination of sound to any specific spot in an IMAX theater; \n\nGreater China is the Company's largest market, measured by revenues, with approximately 38% and 31% of overall revenues generated from its China operations in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 745 theaters operating in Greater China with an additional 251 theaters in backlog that are scheduled to be installed by 2028. The Company's backlog in Greater China represents 47.6% of its total current backlog, including upgrades. The Company's largest single international partnership is in China with Wanda Film ( Wanda\u201d). Wanda's total commitment to the Company is for 361 IMAX Theater Systems in Greater China (of which 347 IMAX Theater Systems are under the parties' joint revenue sharing arrangement).\nOVERVIEW\n (4) The Company is not required to make any minimum payments on the Credit Facility. \nThe Company's System Obligation\u201d consists of the following: (i) an IMAX Theater System, which includes the projector, sound system, screen system and, if applicable, a 3D glasses cleaning machine; (ii) services associated with the IMAX Theater System, including theater design support, the supervision of installation services, and projectionist training; and (iii) a license to use the IMAX brand to market the theater. The System Obligation, as a group, is a distinct performance obligation and a single unit of accounting. The Company is not responsible for the physical installation of the equipment in the customer's facility; however, it supervises the installation by the customer. The customer has the right to use the IMAX brand from the date the Company and the customer enter into an arrangement.\n \u2022 EBITDA; and \n \u2022 large screens and proprietary theater geometry, which result in a substantially larger field of view so that the screen extends to the edge of a viewer's peripheral vision and creates more realistic images; \n (2) Latin America includes South America, Central America and Mexico. \nIn addition to the non-GAAP financial measures discussed above, management also uses EBITDA,\u201d as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement, and which is referred to herein as Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility.\u201d As allowed by the Credit Agreement, Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility includes adjustments in addition to the exclusion of interest, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is presented to allow a more comprehensive analysis of the Company's operating performance and to provide additional information with respect to the Company's compliance against its Credit Agreement requirements, when applicable. In addition, the Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility presents relevant and useful information widely used by analysts, investors and other interested parties in the Company's industry to evaluate, assess and benchmark the Company's results.\nVariable consideration related to the level of the customer's box office receipts is outside of the Company's control as it is dependent upon the commercial success of film content in future periods. The Company tracks numerous performance statistics for box office performance in regions worldwide and applies its understanding of these theater markets to estimate the most likely amount of variable consideration to be earned over the term of the arrangement. The Company then applies a constraint to this estimate by reducing the projection by a percentage factor for theaters or markets with no or limited historical box office experience. In cases where direct historical experience can be observed, average experience, eliminating significant outliers, is used. The resulting amount of variable consideration is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using a risk-weighted discount rate.\nThe Company stratifies its employees into homogeneous groups in order to calculate the grant date fair value of stock options using the Binomial Model. As a result, ranges of assumptions are used for the expected life of the option. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior within the Binomial Model and various groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are grouped together for valuation purposes. The expected volatility rate is estimated based on a blended volatility method which takes into consideration the Company's historical share price volatility, the Company's implied volatility which is determined in reference to observed current market prices for the Company's traded options and the Company's peer group volatility.\n \u2022 The amount of consideration is highly susceptible to factors outside the entity's influence; \nThe following tables provide detailed information about IMAX Theater System signings and installations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n \u2022 the ability to exhibit content that has undergone the IMAX DMR\u00ae conversion process, which results in higher image and sound fidelity than conventional cinema experiences; \nThe Company records write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory based upon management's judgments regarding future events and business conditions, including the anticipated installation dates for the current backlog of theater system contracts, contracts in negotiation, technological developments, growth prospects within the customers' ultimate marketplace and anticipated market acceptance of the Company's current and pending theater systems.\n (3) Represents the total minimum annual rental payments due under the Company's operating leases, almost entirely consisting of rent at the Company's leased office space in New York. \nThe comparison to the prior year is significantly influenced by COVID-19 government relief that the Company became entitled to receive during the year under the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy program and the U.S. CARES Act, of which $6.0 million was recognized in 2020 as a reduction to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Also impacting the comparison to the prior year are management's cost control efforts and lower business activity amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic resulting in lower staff costs, travel, facilities and marketing related expenses, among others. These factors are partially offset by a $19.6 million (38%) decrease in labor and other costs capitalized to inventory, film assets, and joint venture theater equipment or allocated to costs applicable to revenues, due to the lower level of production during the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nIMAX Theater Systems\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include net deferred income tax assets of $18.0 million, net of a valuation allowance of $28.8 million (December 31, 2019 - $23.9 million, net of a valuation allowance of $0.2 million).\nIMAX Enhanced global device partners include Sony Electronics, Hisense, TCL, Phillips, Xiaomi, Sound United among others. By March 2021, IMAX Enhanced will have over six million certified devices in-market. IMAX Enhanced content is now available on six streaming platforms worldwide, with partners that include Sony Pictures Entertainment, Paramount Pictures, Huayi Brothers, Bona Film Group, Tencent Video, iQIYI and FandangoNOW, with more on the way.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $9.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 (2019 - $66.0 million) which includes $6.7 million (2019 - $40.5 million) invested in equipment to be used in the Company's joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitors. In addition, the Company acquired $1.9 million (2019 - $2.9 million) of intangible assets, principally related to the purchase of internal use software, and purchased $0.7 million in property, plant and equipment (2019 - $7.4 million). Furthermore, in the year ended December 31, 2019, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China purchased equity securities in Maoyan for $15.2 million. No investments of equity securities occurred in 2020.\nThe IMAX Systems segment provides IMAX Theater Systems to exhibitors through sale arrangements or long-term lease arrangements that for accounting purposes are classified as sales-type leases. Under these arrangements, in exchange for providing the IMAX Theater System, the Company earns initial fees and ongoing consideration (which can include fixed annual minimum payments and contingent fees in excess of the minimum payments), as well as maintenance and extended warranty fees (see IMAX Maintenance\u201d below). The initial fees vary depending on the system configuration and location of the theater. Initial fees are paid to the Company in installments between the time of signing the arrangement and the time of system installation, which is when the total of these fees, in addition to the present value of future annual minimum payments, are recognized as revenue. Finance income is recognized over the term of a financed sale or sales-type lease arrangement. In addition, in sale arrangements, an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded, is recorded as revenue in the period when the sale is recognized and is adjusted in future periods based on actual results and changes in estimates. Such variable consideration is only recognized on sales transactions to the extent the Company believes there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal.\nLong-lived assets are grouped and reviewed for impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. In such situations, long-lived assets are considered impaired when estimated future cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges) resulting from the use of the asset (or asset group) and its eventual disposition are less than the carrying value of the asset (or asset group). In such situations, the asset (or asset group) is written down to its fair value, which is the present value of the estimated future cash flows. Factors that are considered when evaluating long-lived assets for impairment include a current expectation that it is more likely than not that the long-lived asset will be sold significantly before the end of its useful life, a significant decrease in the market price of the long-lived asset, and a significant change in the extent or manner in which the long-lived asset is being used.\nAsset Impairments\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and recorded a $23.7 million valuation allowance to reduce the value of deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company increased the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by $4.9 million due to additional losses recorded in the period. The valuation allowance is expected to reverse when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from the tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nDue to the COVID-19 global pandemic, substantially all of the theaters in the IMAX network were closed for a significant portion of 2020. In the third quarter of 2020, stay-at-home orders were lifted in many countries and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened with reduced capacities, physical distancing requirements, and other safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, 71% of the theaters in the commercial multiplex network spanning 41 countries were open, including 44% of the theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) locations, 97% of the theaters in Greater China and 53% of the theaters in Rest of World markets. In many parts of Asia, audiences have returned to theaters, particularly IMAX theaters, in numbers consistent with pre-pandemic attendance levels despite the continued delay of Hollywood theatrical releases, which typically account for 70% of box office ticket sales in those regions. Management believes this indicates that moviegoers are eager to return to cinemas where and when theaters are open and moviegoers feel safe. However, ticket sales have been significantly lower than normal levels in theaters outside of Asia as Hollywood movie studios have further delayed the theatrical release dates for a number of films. As a result, certain theater chains have remained closed or have reduced their operating hours. In addition, theaters in major markets remain temporarily closed.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded income tax expense of $26.5 million (2019 - $16.8 million), which includes a $28.6 million valuation allowance recorded in 2020. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. At the point in time when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized, the $28.6 million valuation allowance recorded in 2020 is expected to reverse. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\nThe fair value of RSU awards is equal to the closing price of the Company's common stock on the date of grant. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service periods in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(See Note 17(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for the assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Company's stock options.)\nPlease see Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards and their impact on the Company's financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded $10.8 million in impairment losses principally to write-down the carrying value of certain documentary, alternative content film assets and DMR related film assets due to a decrease in projected box office totals and related revenues based on management's regular quarterly recoverability assessments. As of December 31, 2020, following the recording of these write-downs, the Company's film assets totaled $5.8 million, which principally consists of DMR and documentary content. There can be no assurances that there will not be additional write-downs to the carrying values of these assets as the Company continues to assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d. See Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\n \u2022 The uncertainty about the amount of consideration is not expected to be resolved for a long period of time; \nPayments to be made by the Company under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 are as follows:\nThe Retirement Plan is funded by an investment in company-owned life insurance ( COLI\u201d), which is recorded at its fair value on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Prepaid Expenses. As of December 31, 2020, fair value of the COLI asset was $3.2 million (December 31, 2019 - $3.2 million). Gains and losses resulting from changes in the cash surrender value of the COLI asset are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Gain (Loss) In Fair Value of Investments.\nIMAX films also benefit from enhancements made by individual filmmakers exclusively for the IMAX release of the film. Collectively, the Company refers to these enhancements as IMAX DNA\u201d. Filmmakers and movie studios have sought IMAX-specific enhancements in recent years to generate interest in and excitement for their films. Such enhancements include shooting films with IMAX cameras to increase the audience's immersion in the film and taking advantage of the unique dimensions of the IMAX screen by projecting the film in a larger aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen. Avengers: Endgame, the highest-grossing film in history, released in April 2019, was shot entirely using IMAX cameras. In 2020, Universal Pictures' 1917 was released with select scenes specifically formatted for IMAX screens, Warner Bros. Pictures' Tenet was filmed with IMAX cameras, and Warner Bros. Pictures' Wonder Woman 1984, released globally in December 2020, was partially shot with IMAX cameras. In addition, Bona Film's The Rescue, which was released in China in December 2020, has an expanded aspect ratio that is exclusive to IMAX.\nPerformance Share Units\nTogether these components cause audiences in IMAX theaters to feel as if they are a part of the on-screen action, creating a more intense, immersive and exciting experience than a traditional theater.\n(See Risk Factors - The Company faces risks in connection with its significant presence in China and the continued expansion of its business there\u201d and Risk Factors - General political, social and economic conditions can affect the Company's business by reducing both revenue generated from existing IMAX Theater Systems and the demand for new IMAX Theater Systems\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nIMAX DMR and Film Distribution Services\nThe Company maintained a non-qualified deferred compensation benefit plan (the Retirement Plan\u201d) covering the former CEO of IMAX Entertainment and Senior Executive Vice President of the Company. Under the terms of the Retirement Plan, the benefits were due to vest in full if the executive incurred a separation from service from the Company (as defined therein). In the fourth quarter of 2018, the executive incurred a separation from service from the Company, and as such, the Retirement Plan benefits became fully vested as of December 31, 2018 and the accelerated costs were recognized and reflected in Executive Transition Costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIMAX Maintenance\nIn addition to the level of revenues, IMAX DMR gross margin is also influenced by the costs associated with the films exhibited in the year, and can vary from year to year, particularly with respect to marketing expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2020, marketing expenses were $3.4 million, as compared to $22.5 million in the prior year.\nThe IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category earns revenue principally from the sale or sale-type lease of IMAX Theater Systems, as well as from the maintenance of IMAX Theater Systems. To a lesser extent, the IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance category earns revenue from certain ancillary theater business activities and revenues from hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements. These activities are described in more detail below under each of their respective segments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets include a deferred income tax liability of $19.1 million (December 31, 2019 - $nil).\nThe Company measures share-based compensation expense using the grant date fair value of the award, which is recognized as an expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Share-based compensation expense is not adjusted for estimated forfeitures, but is instead adjusted when and if actual forfeitures occur.\nNet cash provided by financing activities totaled $240.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash used of $57.1 million in 2019. In 2020, the net cash provided by financing activities was principally due to $280.0 million in Credit Facility borrowings drawn in the first quarter of 2020, as discussed above, and $7.6 million drawn on IMAX Shanghai's Working Capital Facility, partially offset by $36.6 million paid to repurchase common shares under the Company's share repurchase program, $3.6 million paid to purchase treasury stock for the settlement of restricted share units and related taxes, $1.5 million for the repurchase of common shares under the IMAX China share repurchase program, $4.2 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling interest shareholders of IMAX China and $1.1 million in Credit Facility amendment fees.\nIMAX Maintenance\nConnected Theaters\nOn January 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d utilizing the modified retrospective transition method and recorded a cumulative catch-up adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of adoption. In conjunction with its adoption, the Company applied ASC Topic 606 only to contracts that were not completed as of the date of adoption, referred to as open contracts. IMAX Theater System sales and maintenance contracts within the existing network of open theaters and sales backlog comprise a significant majority of the Company's open contracts at any point in time. DMR arrangements where the film continues to be shown by the Company's exhibitor partners, film distribution arrangements with remaining terms, and aftermarket sales orders that have been received but for which control of the product has not yet transferred to the customer are all also considered open contracts.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses decreased by $15.0 million (12%), when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses, excluding the impact of share-based compensation of $20.7 million, were $87.8 million, as compared to $102.7 million in the prior year, excluding share-based compensation of $20.8 million, representing a decrease of $14.9 million (14.5%). A portion of share-based compensation expense is recognized within Cost and Expenses Applicable to Revenue and Research and Development. (See Note 17 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe Other Theater Business segment principally includes after-market sales of IMAX projection system parts and 3D glasses.\nIMAX NETWORK AND BACKLOG\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor partners who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the disruption in their normal business operations during the pandemic. Accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company increased its provision for current expected credit losses by $18.6 million, reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater related receivables balances and the heightened collection risk associated with certain movie studios in foreign markets. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on the Company's customers and their ability to meet their financial obligations to the Company is difficult to predict.\nIncluded in interest expense is the amortization of deferred finance costs in the amount of $0.9 million and $0.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company incurred fees of approximately $1.1 million in connection with the Credit Facility amendment, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2021. The Company's policy is to defer and amortize all the costs relating to debt financing which are paid directly to the debt provider, over the life of the debt instrument.\nFilm Distribution and Post-Production\nBased on the Company's current cash balances and operating cash flows, management expects to have sufficient capital and liquidity to fund its anticipated operating needs and capital requirements during the twelve month period following the date of this report. However, as discussed above, the risk of breaching the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility borrowings would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nThe Company remains in active negotiations with all major Hollywood studios for additional films to fill out its short and long-term film slate for the IMAX network. However, as a result of the theater closures associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, Hollywood movie studios have postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films have been released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. Accordingly, as of the filing of this report, there remains uncertainty around the release dates of certain major films.\n (2) Includes 144 new IMAX with Laser projection system configurations and 92 upgrades of existing locations to IMAX with Laser projection system configurations. \nIn late January 2020, in response to the public health risks associated with COVID-19, the Chinese government directed exhibitors in China to temporarily close more than 70,000 movie theaters, including all of the approximately 700 IMAX theaters in mainland China. On March 11, 2020, due to the worsening public health crisis associated with the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 was characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization, and in the following weeks, local, state and national governments instituted stay-at-home orders and restrictions on large public gatherings which caused movie theaters in countries around the world to temporarily close, including substantially all of the IMAX theaters in those countries. As a result of the theater closures, movie studios postponed the theatrical release of most films originally scheduled for release in 2020 and early 2021, including many scheduled to be shown in IMAX theaters, while several other films were released directly or concurrently to streaming platforms. More recently, stay-at-home orders have been lifted in many countries and movie theaters throughout the IMAX network gradually reopened in the third quarter of 2020 with reduced capacities, physical distancing requirements, and other safety measures. As of December 31, 2020, 71% of the theaters in the IMAX commercial multiplex network were open, spanning 41 countries. This included 44% of the theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) locations, 97% of the theaters in Greater China and 53% of the theaters in Rest of World markets. In many parts of Asia, audiences have returned to theaters, particularly IMAX theaters, in numbers consistent with pre-pandemic attendance levels despite the continued delay of Hollywood theatrical releases, which typically account for 70% of box office ticket sales in those regions. Management believes this indicates that moviegoers are eager to return to cinemas where and when theaters are open and moviegoers feel safe. However, ticket sales have been significantly lower than normal levels in theaters outside of Asia as Hollywood movie studios have further delayed the theatrical release dates for a number of films. As a result, certain theater chains have remained closed or have reduced their operating hours. In addition, theaters in major markets remain temporarily closed.\nTo be certified, leading consumer electronics manufacturers spanning 4K/8K televisions, projectors, A/V receivers, loudspeakers, subwoofers and soundbars must meet a carefully prescribed set of audio and video performance standards, set by a certification committee of IMAX and DTS engineers and some of Hollywood's leading technical specialists.\nThe repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the Company's revenues, earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 as GBO results from theater exhibitors declined significantly, the installation of certain Theater Systems was delayed, and maintenance services were generally suspended for theaters that were closed. During time periods when there is a lack of new films released by movie studios and a significant number of theaters in the IMAX network are closed, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in earnings and operating cash flows as it is generating significantly lower than normal levels of GBO-based revenue from its joint revenue sharing arrangements and digital remastering services, it is unable to provide normal maintenance services to any of the theaters that remain closed, and while some installation activity is continuing, certain theater system installations have, and may continue to be delayed. In addition, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor partners who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the theater closures. In response, the Company has provided temporary relief to exhibitor partners by waiving or reducing maintenance fees during periods when theaters are closed or operating with reduced capacities and, in certain situations, by providing extended payment terms on annual minimum payment obligations in exchange for a corresponding or longer extension of the term of the underlying sale or lease arrangement.\nUnder certain other joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX Theater System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. As with a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement, the customer also pays the Company a percentage of contingent box office receipts over the term of the arrangement, although this percentage is typically half that of a traditional joint revenue sharing arrangement. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, while the fixed upfront payment is recorded as revenue within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a sale, see the discussion below under IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance.\nRevenues associated with both IMAX DMR and Film Distribution arrangements qualify for the variable consideration exemption for sales- or usage-based royalties in ASC Topic 606 and are recognized in the period when the corresponding box office sales occur.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company's capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. As a result, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $19.1 million for the year for the estimated applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with these historical earnings, which will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings.\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Management's judgments, assumptions, and estimates are based on historical experience, future expectations and other factors that are believed to be reasonable as of the date of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Actual results may ultimately differ from the Company's original estimates, as future events and circumstances sometimes do not develop as expected, and the differences may be material. Management believes that the following are the Company's most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are not ranked in any particular order, that may affect the Company's reported results of operations and/or financial condition. The Company's other significant accounting policies are described in Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Contingent Rent\nThe introduction of joint revenue sharing arrangements has been an important factor in the expansion of the Company's commercial theater network. Joint revenue sharing arrangements allow commercial theater exhibitors to install IMAX Theater Systems without the significant initial capital investment required in a sale or sales-type lease arrangement. Joint revenue sharing arrangements drive recurring cash flows and earnings for the Company, as customers under joint revenue sharing arrangements pay the Company a portion of their ongoing box office. The Company funds its joint revenue sharing arrangements through cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 890 theaters in operation under joint revenue sharing arrangements, a 2.3% increase as compared to the 870 theaters in operation under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2019. The Company also had contracts in backlog for 342 theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements as of December 31, 2020, including 87 upgrades to existing theater locations and 255 new theater locations.\nIMAX is one of the world's leading entertainment technology companies, specializing in technological innovations powering the presentation of some of today's most immersive entertainment experiences. Through its proprietary software, theater architecture, patented intellectual property and specialized equipment, IMAX offers a unique end-to-end cinematic solution to create the highest quality, most immersive motion picture and other entertainment event experiences for which the IMAX\u00ae brand has become known globally. Top filmmakers and movie studios utilize the cutting-edge visual and sound technology of IMAX to connect with audiences in innovative ways, and, as a result, IMAX's network is among the most important and successful distribution platforms for major films and other events around the world.\nAs of December 31, 2020, 276 (2019 - 277) of the 750 (2019 - 731) theaters under traditional joint revenue sharing arrangements in operation, or 36.8% (2019 - 37.9%) were located in the United States or Canada, with the remaining 474 (2019 - 454) or 63.2% (2019 - 62.1%) of theaters under traditional joint revenue sharing arrangements located in international markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Maintenance revenue and gross margin decreased by $31.2 million (59%) and $19.9 million (87%), respectively, as maintenance revenue was not recognized during the periods of time when theaters were closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Company incurred fees of approximately $1.1 million in connection with the Amendment, which are being amortized on a straight-line basis through December 31, 2021.\n\nCertain of the Company's contracts contain options for the customer to elect to upgrade system type during the term or to alter the contract structure (for example, from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sale) after signing but before installation. Current backlog information reflects all known elections.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance revenue and gross margin decreased by $100.1 million (56%) and $58.4 million (68%), respectively, when compared to the prior year as the pace of theater system installations slowed significantly and maintenance revenue was not recognized for theaters that remained closed during the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above. See below for separate discussions of IMAX Systems and IMAX Maintenance results for the year.\n \u2022 The entity has a practice of either offering a broad range of price concessions or changing the payment terms and conditions of similar contracts in similar circumstances. \nThe Company continues to believe that the IMAX network serves as a valuable platform to launch and distribute original content, especially during periods between peak and off-peak seasons, known as \"shoulder periods\".\nIMAX Technology Network results are influenced by the level of commercial success and box office performance of the films released to the network, as well as other factors including the timing of the films released, the length of the theatrical distribution window, the take rates under the Company's DMR and joint revenue sharing arrangements and the level of marketing spend associated with the films released in the year. Other factors impacting IMAX Technology Network results include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies versus the U.S. Dollar.\nThe Company has a postretirement plan to provide health and welfare benefits to Canadian employees meeting certain eligibility requirements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an unfunded benefit obligation of $1.9 million within Accrued and Other Liabilities related to this plan (December 31, 2019 - $1.6 million).\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nThe Company utilizes a lattice-binomial option-pricing model ( Binomial Model\u201d) to determine the fair value of stock option awards on the grant date. The fair value determined by the Binomial Model is affected by the Company's stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the award, and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors. The Binomial Model also considers the expected exercise multiple which is the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable. Because the Company's employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options, and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value, in management's opinion, the Binomial Model best provides a fair measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options.\nIn a Film Distribution arrangement, the Company licenses film content and distributes large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company's Film Distribution revenues are strictly from the license of its intellectual property in the form of documentary film content to which the Company holds exclusive distribution rights.\nThe IMAX Technology Network category earns revenue based on contingent box office receipts and includes the IMAX DMR segment and contingent rent from the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement ( JRSA\u201d) segment, as described in more detail below.\nSOURCES OF REVENUE\nThe following table provides detailed information about the Company's backlog as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nWorking Capital Facility\nThe amount and timing of compensation expense recognized for PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is dependent upon management's assessment of the likelihood and timing of achieving these targets. If, as a result of management's assessment, it is projected that a greater number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to increase compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if, as a result of management's assessment, it is projected that a lower number of PSUs will vest than previously anticipated, a life-to-date adjustment to decrease compensation expense is recorded in the period such determination is made.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Contingent Rent\nThe Company grants two types of PSU awards, one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain EBITDA-based targets and one which vests based on a combination of employee service and the achievement of certain stock-price targets. These awards vest over a three-year performance period. The grant date fair value of PSUs with EBITDA-based targets is equal to the closing price on the date of grant or the average closing price of the Company's common stock for five days prior to the date of grant. The grant date fair value of PSUs with stock-price targets is determined on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation, which is a valuation model that takes into account the likelihood of achieving the stock-price targets embedded in the award ( Monte Carlo Model\u201d). The compensation expense attributable to each type of PSU is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. At the conclusion of the three-year performance period, the number of PSUs that ultimately vest can range from 0% to a maximum vesting opportunity of 175% of the initial award, depending upon actual performance versus the established EBITDA and stock-price targets.\n (2) Principally includes after-market sales of IMAX projection system parts and 3D glasses. \nIMAX Technology Network\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nCash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled to $23.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $90.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net cash outflow from operating activities is principally due to the significant decrease in the Company's revenue and earnings as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic.\nThe estimates used in the Company's goodwill impairment tests and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. If business conditions deteriorate further, or should they remain depressed for a more prolonged period of time, management's estimates of operating results and future cash flows for the IMAX Systems and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements reporting units may be insufficient to support the goodwill assigned to them, thus requiring impairment charges. The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment.\nThe recognition of variable consideration involves a significant amount of judgment. Variable consideration is recognized subject to appropriate constraints to avoid a significant reversal of revenue in future periods. The Company reviews its variable consideration assets on at least a quarterly basis. ASC Topic 606 identifies several examples of situations when constraining variable consideration is appropriate:\nFor the purposes of MD&A the Company has organized its reportable segments into the following four categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; (iii) New Business Initiatives; and (iv) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these four categories are the Company's following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements; (iii) IMAX Systems; (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) New Business Initiatives; (vii) Film Distribution; and (viii) Film Post-Production. In the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated certain financial statement line descriptions (with no change to the classification of amounts) within Revenues and Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues in its Consolidated Statements of Operations to better describe the nature of its revenue-generating activities and related costs.\n (1) Period-to-period changes in the tables above are reported net of the effect of permanently closed theaters. \nAs a result of the engineering and scientific achievements that are a hallmark of The IMAX Experience\u00ae, the Company's exhibitor customers typically charge a premium for IMAX DMR films over films exhibited in their other auditoriums. The premium pricing, combined with the higher attendance levels associated with IMAX DMR films, generates incremental box office for the Company's exhibitor customers and for the movie studios releasing their films to the IMAX network. The incremental box office generated by IMAX DMR films has helped establish IMAX as a key premium distribution and marketing platform for Hollywood blockbuster films.\n (1) Greater China includes China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. \nIMAX Theater System arrangements are non-cancellable unless the Company fails to perform its obligations. In the absence of a material default by the Company, there is no right to any remedy for the customer under the Company's arrangements. If a material default by the Company exists, the customer has the right to terminate the arrangement and seek a refund only if the customer provides notice to the Company of a material default and only if the Company does not cure the default within a specified period.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company's reportable segments are organized into the following four categories: (i) IMAX Technology Network; (ii) IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance; (iii) New Business Initiatives; and (iv) Film Distribution and Post-Production. Within these categories are the Company's following reportable segments: (i) IMAX DMR; (ii) Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements; (iii) IMAX Systems, (iv) IMAX Maintenance; (v) Other Theater Business; (vi) New Business Initiatives; (vii) Film Distribution; and (viii) Film Post-Production, each of which are described above under Sources of Revenue.\u201d This categorization is consistent with how the CODM reviews the financial performance of the Company and makes strategic decisions regarding resource allocation and investments to meet long-term business goals. Management believes that a discussion and analysis based on the four categories listed above is significantly more relevant and useful to readers, as the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations captions combine results from several segments.\nThe Company's business and future prospects are evaluated by Richard L. Gelfond, its Chief Executive Officer ( CEO\u201d), using a variety of factors and financial and operational metrics including: (i) the signing, installation and financial performance of theater system arrangements, particularly joint revenue sharing arrangements and those involving laser-based projection systems; (ii) film performance and the securing of new film projects, particularly IMAX DMR films; (iii) the continuing ability to invest in and improve the Company's technology to enhance the differentiation of The IMAX Experience versus other cinematic experiences; (iv) revenues and gross margins earned by the Company's segments, as discussed below; (v) consolidated earnings from operations, as adjusted for unusual items; (vi) the overall execution, reliability and consumer acceptance of The IMAX Experience; (vii) the success of new business initiatives; and (viii) short- and long-term cash flow projections.\n\nUnder most joint revenue sharing arrangements (both traditional and hybrid), the initial non-cancellable term is 10 years or longer and is renewable by the customer for one to two additional terms of between three to five years. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer. The contracts are non-cancellable by the customer unless the Company fails to perform its obligations.\nManagement is encouraged by recent box office results in markets like China, Japan and South Korea where the virus is under control and audiences have demonstrated a willingness to return to cinema. However, the Company may continue to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic even after a significant portion or all theaters are reopened. The global economic impact of COVID-19 has led to record levels of unemployment in certain countries, which has led to, and may continue to result in lower consumer spending. The timing and extent of a recovery of consumer behavior and willingness to spend discretionary income on movie-going may delay the Company's ability to generate significant GBO-based revenue until consumer behavior normalizes and consumer spending recovers.\nIn July 2000, the Company agreed to maintain health benefits for Messrs. Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler, the Company's former Co-CEO and current Chairman of its Board of Directors, upon retirement. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes an unfunded benefit obligation of $0.7 million within Accrued and Other Liabilities related to this plan (December 31, 2019 - $0.7 million).\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Company's option, at (i) LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum; or (ii) the U.S. base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% per annum, in each case depending on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement); provided, however, that from the effective date of the Amendment until the Company delivers a compliance certificate under the Credit Facility following the end of the Designated Period, the applicable margin for LIBOR borrowings will be 2.50% per annum and the applicable margin for U.S. base rate borrowings will be 1.75% per annum. The effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 2.38% (2019 - 3.43%).\nThe Company has an unfunded defined benefit pension plan, the SERP, covering the Company's CEO, Mr. Gelfond. Under the terms of the SERP, if Mr. Gelfond's employment is terminated other than for cause (as defined in his employment agreement), he is entitled to receive SERP benefits in the form of a lump sum payment. SERP benefit payments to Mr. Gelfond are subject to a deferral for six months after the termination of his employment, at which time Mr. Gelfond will be entitled to receive interest on the deferred amount credited at the applicable federal rate for short-term obligations. Pursuant to an amendment to his employment agreement dated November 1, 2019, the term of Mr. Gelfond's employment was extended through December 31, 2022, although Mr. Gelfond has not informed the Company that he intends to retire at that time. Under the terms of this amendment to his employment agreement, the total benefit payable to Mr. Gelfond under the SERP was fixed at $20.3 million. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes the present value of the related SERP benefit obligation of approximately $20.1 million recorded within Accrued and Other Liabilities (December 31, 2019 - $18.8 million).\n (1) Includes initial upfront payments and the present value of fixed minimum payments from sale and sales-type lease arrangements of IMAX Theater Systems, and the present value of estimated variable consideration from sales of IMAX Theater Systems. To a lesser extent, also includes finance income associated with these revenue streams. \nWithin the Credit Facility, the Company is able to purchase foreign currency forward contracts and/or other swap arrangements. The net settlement gain on its foreign currency forward contracts was $2.0 million at December 31, 2020, as the fair value of the forward contracts exceeded the notional value (December 31, 2019 - $0.5 million). As of December 31, 2020, the Company has $31.9 million in notional value of such arrangements outstanding (December 31, 2019 - $36.1 million).\nThe Company is also experimenting with new technologies and new content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, which includes curating unique, differentiated alternative content to be exhibited in IMAX theaters, particularly during those periods when Hollywood blockbuster film content is not available.\nOn June 10, 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Agreement (the Amendment\u201d), which, among other things, (i) suspends the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant through the first quarter of 2021, (ii) re-establishes the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant thereafter, provided that for subsequent quarters that such covenant is tested, as applicable, the Company will be permitted to use its quarterly EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement) from the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in lieu of the EBITDA for the corresponding quarters of 2020, (iii) adds a $75.0 million minimum liquidity covenant measured at the end of each calendar month and (iv) restricts the Company's ability to make certain restricted payments, dispositions and investments, create or assume liens and incur debt that would otherwise have been permitted by the Credit Agreement. The modifications to the negative covenants, the minimum liquidity covenant and modifications to certain other provisions in the Credit Agreement pursuant to the Amendment were effective from the date of the Amendment until the earlier of the delivery of the compliance certificate for the fourth quarter of 2021 and the date on which the Company, in its sole discretion, elects to calculate its compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio by using either its actual EBITDA or annualized EBITDA (the Designated Period\u201d).\n (3) Period-to-period changes in the tables above are reported net of the effect of permanently closed theaters. \nIn addition to the level of revenues, JRSA margin is also influenced by the level of costs associated with such arrangements, such as depreciation expense related to the underlying Theater Systems and costs incurred to upgrade Theater Systems from digital xenon to IMAX with Laser, as well as advertising, marketing and commission costs primarily for the launch of new theaters. The level of depreciation expense in a year relative to the prior year is a function of the growth of the theater network and the mix of theater system configurations in the network. For the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA gross margin included depreciation expense of $24.9 million, as compared to $23.2 million in the prior year reflecting a 2% increase in the number of theaters operating under joint revenue sharing arrangements during the year and the impact of new theaters operating throughout 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA gross margin includes certain advertising, marketing and commission costs of $1.4 million, as compared to $3.3 million in the prior year.\nThe recoverability of the Company's film assets is dependent upon the commercial acceptance of the underlying films and the resulting level of box office results and, in certain situations, ancillary revenues. If management's projections of future net cash flows resulting from the exploitation of a film indicate that the carrying value of the film asset is not recoverable, the film asset is written down to its fair value.\nThe Company's effective tax rate for year ended December 31, 2020 of (20.5)% differs from the Canadian statutory tax rate of 26.2%, primarily due to the recording of the valuation allowance discussed above, withholding taxes associated with the reversal of the indefinite reinvestment assertion for certain foreign subsidiaries, as discussed below, permanent book to tax differences, jurisdictional tax rate differences, and management's estimates of contingent liabilities related to the resolution of various tax examinations.\n(See Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\n (2) The Company has an unfunded defined benefit pension plan, the Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the SERP\u201d), covering its CEO, Mr. Richard L. Gelfond. The SERP has a fixed benefit payable of $20.3 million. The table above assumes that Mr. Gelfond will receive a lump sum payment of $20.3 million six months after retirement at the end of the term of his current employment agreement, which expires on December 31, 2022, in accordance with the terms of the SERP, although Mr. Gelfond has not informed the Company that he intends to retire at that time. \nThe primary drivers of IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance results are the number of IMAX Theater Systems installed in a year, and the level of gross margin percentage earned on each installation, as well as the associated maintenance contracts that accompany each theater installation. The installation of IMAX Theater Systems in newly built theaters or multiplexes, which make up a large portion of the Company's theater system backlog, depends primarily on the timing of the construction of those projects, which is not under the Company's control.\nA reconciliation from net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts to adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share is presented in the table below. Net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and the associated per share amounts are the most directly comparable GAAP measures because they reflect the earnings relevant to the Company's shareholders, rather than the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to reflect this approach.\nThe Company's operating cash flows and cash balances will be adversely affected if management's projections of future signings of IMAX Theater Systems and film performance, theater installations and film productions are not realized. The Company forecasts its short-term liquidity requirements on a quarterly and annual basis. Since the Company's future cash flows are based on estimates and there may be factors that are outside of the Company's control (see Risk Factors\u201d in Part I, Item 1A), there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to fund its operations through cash flows from operations. Under the terms of the Company's typical sale and sales-type lease agreements, the Company receives substantial cash payments before the Company completes the performance of its obligations. Similarly, the Company receives cash payments for some of its film productions in advance of related cash expenditures.\nThe application of U.S. GAAP related to the measurement and recognition of revenue requires management to make judgments and estimates. In addition, revenue contracts with nonstandard terms and conditions may require significant interpretation to determine the appropriate accounting.\nIMAX Systems\nRevenues from the sale of IMAX Theater Systems, the provision of maintenance services for IMAX Theater Systems, the sale of aftermarket projection system parts and 3D glasses, the conversion of film content into the IMAX DMR format, the distribution of documentary film content and the provision of post-production services are all within the scope of ASC Topic 606. The Company's joint revenue sharing revenue arrangements, with the exception of those where title of the IMAX Theater System transfers to the customer, known as hybrid sales, are not in scope of ASC Topic 606 as they are classified as leases. Similarly, any IMAX Theater System arrangements classified as sales-type leases are also excluded from ASC Topic 606.\n\nInterest expense was $7.0 million in 2020, as compared to $2.8 million in the prior year. The increase in interest expense versus the prior year is due to a higher level of Credit Facility borrowings, which were outstanding for most of the year. In the first quarter of 2020, in response to uncertainties associated with the outbreak of the COVID-19 global pandemic and its impact on the Company's business, the Company drew down $280.0 million in available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility, resulting in total outstanding borrowings of $300.0 million. Furthermore, the Company entered into a First Amendment to the Credit Agreement in June 2020, primarily to suspend the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant through the first quarter of 2021. During the amendment period, the applicable margin increased by 150 basis points. The fully drawn Credit Facility coupled with the increase to the applicable margin during the amendment period has resulted in higher interest expense in current year versus prior year period. (See Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe New Business Initiatives segment includes activities related to the exploration of new lines of business and new initiatives outside of the Company's core business, which seek to leverage its proprietary, innovative technologies, its leadership position in the entertainment technology space and its unique relationship with content creators. Such new business initiatives currently include IMAX Enhanced and Connected Theaters, as discussed below.\nThe Company has also implemented an active cash management process, which, among other things, requires senior management approval of all outgoing payments. In addition, in the first quarter of 2020, the Company drew down $280.0 million in remaining available borrowing capacity under the Credit Facility provided by its Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (both as defined in Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d), which was then amended in June 2020 to, among other things, suspend the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant in the Credit Agreement through the first quarter of 2021 and substitute quarterly EBITDA from the third and fourth quarters of 2019 in lieu of the EBITDA for the corresponding quarters of 2020 to meet the original Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant.\nIn addition, the Credit Facility has standby fees ranging from 0.25% to 0.38% per annum, based on the Company's Total Leverage Ratio with respect to the unused portion of the Credit Facility; provided, however, that from the effective date of the Amendment until the Company delivers a compliance certificate under the Credit Facility following the end of the Designated Period, the standby fee will be 0.50% per annum.\n \u2022 advanced, high-resolution projectors with specialized equipment and automated theater control systems, which generate significantly more contrast and brightness than conventional theater systems; \n\n (3) For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a valuation allowance to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets attributable to certain jurisdictions where management cannot reliably estimate future tax liabilities within the next five years, primarily due to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic. As a result, the calculated tax impact as a percentage of the related non-GAAP adjustments is lower than in the prior year. \n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nThe Company has developed a new home entertainment licensing and certification program called IMAX Enhanced. This initiative was launched along with audio leader DTS (an Xperi subsidiary), capitalizing on the companies' decades of combined expertise in image and sound science. IMAX Enhanced brings IMAX digitally re-mastered 4K high dynamic range (HDR) content and DTS audio technologies to premier streaming platforms and best-in-class consumer electronics devices worldwide, offering consumers high-fidelity sight and sound experiences for the home.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 1,650 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 84 countries and territories, including 1,562 commercial multiplexes, 12 commercial destinations, and 76 institutional locations. This compares to 1,624 IMAX Theater Systems operating in 81 countries and territories as of December 31, 2019 including 1,529 commercial multiplexes, 14 commercial destinations, and 81 institutional locations. (See the table below under IMAX Network and Backlog\u201d for additional information on the composition of the IMAX network.)\n\nThe IMAX Theater System provides the Company's exhibitor customers with a combination of the following benefits:\nIn an IMAX DMR arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a third party who owns the copyright to a film in exchange for converting the film into IMAX DMR format and distributing it through the IMAX network. In these arrangements, although the Company does not hold rights to the intellectual property in the form of the film content, it is compensated for the application of its intellectual property in the form of its patented DMR processes to create new intellectual property in the form of an IMAX DMR version of film.\n (2) The Company recognized $6.4 million in benefits from the CEWS program and $0.7 million in benefits from the U.S. CARES Act, as reductions to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ($6.0 million), Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues ($1.0 million) and Research and Development ($0.1 million) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. \nThe Company has a credit agreement, the Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association ( Wells Fargo\u201d), as agent, and a syndicate of lenders party thereto (the Credit Agreement\u201d). The Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement are guaranteed by certain of its subsidiaries (the Guarantors\u201d) and are secured by first-priority security interests in substantially all the assets of the Company and the Guarantors. The facility provided by the Credit Agreement (the Credit Facility\u201d) matures on June 28, 2023.\n (1) Reflects amounts attributable to common shareholders. \nThe Company cautions users of its financial statements that these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Additionally, the non-GAAP financial measures used by the Company should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable GAAP amounts.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test considering the latest available information and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total Goodwill was $39.0 million, of which $19.1 million relates to the IMAX Systems reporting unit, $13.5 million relates to the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement reporting unit, and $6.4 million relates to the IMAX Maintenance reporting unit. The impairment test was performed on a reporting unit level by comparing each unit's carrying value, including goodwill, to its fair value. The carrying value of each reporting unit is based on a systematic and rational allocation of certain assets and liabilities. The fair value of each reporting unit is assessed using a discounted cash flow model based on management's current short-term forecast and estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses are performed. The discount rates used in the cash flow model are derived based on the Company's estimated weighted average cost of capital. These estimates and the likelihood of future changes in these estimates depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Credit Agreement contains a covenant that requires the Company to maintain a Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement), as of the last day of any Fiscal Quarter (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of no greater than 3.25:1.00. In addition, the Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, including covenants that limit indebtedness, liens, capital expenditures, asset sales, investments and restricted payments, in each case subject to negotiated exceptions and baskets. The Credit Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and event of default provisions.\nOperating Activities\nThe Company has applied for and received wage subsidies, tax credits and other financial support under COVID-19 relief legislation that has been enacted in the countries in which it operates. During 2020, the Company recognized $6.4 million in benefits from the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy ( CEWS\u201d) program and $0.7 million in benefits from the U.S. CARES Act, as reductions to Selling, General and Administrative Expenses ($6.0 million), Costs and Expenses Applicable to Revenues ($1.0 million) and Research and Development ($0.1 million) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The CEWS program has been extended to June 2021. The Company will continue to review and apply for additional subsidies and credits for the remaining terms of these programs, where applicable.\nThe Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures that allow management and users of the Company's financial statements to view operating trends and analyze controllable operating performance on a comparable basis between periods without the after-tax impact of share-based compensation and certain unusual items included in net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders. Although share-based compensation is an important aspect of the Company's employee and executive compensation packages, it is a non-cash expense and is excluded from certain internal business performance measures.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company updated its recoverability tests of the carrying values of the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are recorded within Property, Plant and Equipment. In performing its reviews of recoverability, the Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. The cash flow estimates used in these tests are consistent with management's estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses were performed. These estimates are highly uncertain due to the COVID-19 global pandemic; therefore, management's estimated cash flows factor in a number of underlying variables and ranges of possible cash flow scenarios. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million related to the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements.\nJoint Revenue Sharing Arrangements - Fixed Fees\nUnder certain joint revenue sharing arrangements, known as hybrid arrangements, the customer is responsible for making fixed upfront payments prior to the delivery and installation of the IMAX Theater System in an amount that is typically half of what the Company would receive from a typical sale transaction. For hybrid joint revenue sharing arrangements that take the form of a lease, the contingent rent is reported within the IMAX Technology Network, as discussed above, while the fixed upfront payment is reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance.\nThe repercussions of the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decrease in the Company's revenues, earnings and operating cash flows in 2020 as gross box office ( GBO\u201d) results from the Company's theater customers declined significantly, the installation of certain theater systems was delayed, and maintenance services were generally suspended for theaters that were closed. While there continues to be a lack of new films released by movie studios and a significant number of theaters in the IMAX network are closed, the Company is experiencing a significant decline in earnings and operating cash flows as it is generating significantly lower than normal levels of GBO-based revenue from its joint revenue sharing arrangements and digital remastering services, it is unable to provide normal maintenance services to any of the theaters that remain closed, and while some installation activity is continuing, certain theater system installations have, and may continue to be delayed. In addition, the Company has experienced and is likely to continue to experience delays in collecting payments due under existing theater sale or lease arrangements from its exhibitor customers who are facing financial difficulties as a result of the theater closures. In response, the Company has provided temporary relief to exhibitor customers by waiving or reducing maintenance fees during periods when theaters are closed or operating with reduced capacities and, in certain situations, by providing extended payment terms on annual minimum payment obligations in exchange for a corresponding or longer extension of the term of the underlying sale or lease arrangement. In 2020, the Company increased its provision for current expected credit losses by $18.6 million, in part reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater related accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, which management believes is primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and adequately addresses the risk of not collecting these receivables in full.\nThe Company has developed IMAX DMR, a proprietary technology that digitally remasters Hollywood films into IMAX formats. In a typical IMAX DMR film arrangement, the Company receives a percentage of the box office receipts from a movie studio in exchange for converting a commercial film into IMAX DMR format and distributing it through the IMAX network. In recent years, the percentage of gross box office receipts earned in IMAX DMR arrangements has averaged approximately 12.5%, except for within Greater China, where the Company receives a lower percentage of net box office receipts for certain Hollywood films.\nThe Company is subject to ongoing tax exposures, examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Tax benefits are recognized only when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the benefits will be sustained on examination. Tax benefits that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured using a probability weighting of the largest amount of tax benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. Whether the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is met for a particular tax benefit is a matter of judgment based on the individual facts and circumstances evaluated in light of all available evidence as of the balance sheet date. Although management believes that the Company has adequately accounted for its uncertain tax positions, tax audits can result in subsequent assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in the Company owing additional taxes above what was originally recognized in its financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded asset impairments of $1.2 million (2019 - $nil) principally related to write-down of content-related assets which became impaired in the year. (See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.).\n \u2022 The Company's experience (or other evidence) with similar types of contracts is limited, or that experience has limited predictive value; and \n (2) Includes a digital theater system relocated from a previous location. This installation is incremental to the IMAX network but full revenue for the digital system was not received. \n (1) The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX Theater System includes fixed upfront and ongoing consideration, including indexed annual minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as an estimate of the contingent fees that may become due if certain annual minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. \n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nThe Credit Agreement has a revolving borrowing capacity of $300.0 million, and contains an uncommitted accordion feature allowing the Company to further expand its borrowing capacity to $440.0 million or greater, subject to certain conditions, depending on the mix of revolving and term loans comprising the incremental facility.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the benefit obligation related to the Retirement Plan was $3.7 million (December 31, 2019 - $3.6 million) and is recorded on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets within Accrued and Other Liabilities. As the Retirement Plan is fully vested, the benefit obligation is measured at the present value of the benefits expected to be paid in the future with the accretion of interest recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations within Retirement Benefits Non-Service Expenses.\nThe Company assesses the realization of deferred income tax assets and, based on all available evidence, concludes whether it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax assets will be realized. A valuation allowance is provided for the amount of deferred income tax assets not considered to be realizable. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers, among other things, projections of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. If management determines that sufficient negative evidence exists (for example, if the Company experiences cumulative three-year losses in a certain jurisdiction), then management will consider recording a valuation allowance against a portion or all of the deferred tax assets in that jurisdiction. If, after recording a valuation allowance, management's projections of future taxable income and other positive evidence considered in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be inaccurate, it could prove more difficult to support the realization of these deferred tax assets. As a result, an additional valuation allowance could be required, which would have an adverse impact on the Company's effective income tax rate and results. Conversely, if, after recording a valuation allowance, management determines that sufficient positive evidence exists in the jurisdiction in which a valuation allowance is recorded (for example, if the Company is no longer in a three-year cumulative loss position in the jurisdiction, and management expects to have future taxable income in that jurisdiction based upon management's forecasts and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals), the Company may reverse a portion or all of the valuation allowance in that jurisdiction. In such situations, the adjustment made to the deferred tax asset would have a favorable impact on the Company's effective income tax rate and results in the period such determination was made.\nLoss in Fair Value of Investments\nBacklog\nInterest Expense\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company assessed the recoverability of its deferred tax assets and recorded a $23.7 million valuation allowance to reduce the value of deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded in the jurisdictions where management could not reliably forecast that future tax liabilities would arise within the next five years, primarily due to the uncertainties around the long-term impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company increased the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets by $4.9 million due to additional losses recorded in the period. The valuation allowance is expected to reverse when the Company determines it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions will be realized. Despite this valuation allowance, the Company remains entitled to benefit from the tax attributes which currently have a valuation allowance applied to them.\nGAAP refers to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America. In this report, the Company presents financial measures in accordance with GAAP and also on a non-GAAP basis under U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules. Specifically, the Company presents the following non-GAAP financial measures as supplemental measures of its performance:\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nThe Company's $317.4 million balance of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 includes $89.9 million in cash held outside of Canada (December 31, 2019-$90.1 million), of which $77.2 million was held in the People's Republic of China (the PRC\u201d) (December 31, 2019-$67.6 million). In the first quarter of 2020, management completed a reassessment of its strategy with respect to the most efficient means of deploying the Company's capital resources globally. Based on the results of this reassessment, management concluded that the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries in excess of amounts required to sustain business operations would no longer be indefinitely reinvested. As a result, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a deferred tax liability of $19.1 million for the applicable foreign withholding taxes associated with these historical earnings, which will become payable upon the repatriation of any such earnings.\n\nGoodwill\nThe Company currently believes that over time its commercial multiplex network could grow to approximately 3,318 IMAX theaters worldwide from the 1,562 operating as of December 31, 2020. The Company believes that the majority of its future growth will come from international markets. As of December 31, 2020, 72.8% of IMAX Theater Systems in operation were located within international markets (defined as all countries other than the United States and Canada), an increase from 71.9% as of December 31, 2019. Revenues and gross box office derived from international markets continue to exceed revenues and gross box office from the United States and Canada. This was especially true during 2020 as the pace and extent of the reopening of IMAX theaters in Greater China amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic exceeded that of theaters in Domestic (i.e., United States and Canada) and Rest of World markets. (See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above.) Risks associated with the Company's international business are outlined in Risk Factors - The Company conducts business internationally, which exposes it to uncertainties and risks that could negatively affect its operations, sales and future growth prospects\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its requirements under the Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company's continued compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement will depend on the Company's ability to generate sufficient EBITDA to ensure compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months, which is dependent on the timing of when theaters in the IMAX network resume normal operations. The risk of breaching this covenant within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\n \u2022 Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders; \nIn response to uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company has taken and is continuing to take significant steps to preserve cash by eliminating non-essential costs, placing certain employees on a temporary furlough, reducing the working hours of other employees and reducing all non-essential capital expenditures to minimum levels.\nSignings and Installations\nThe transaction price in an IMAX Theater System arrangement is allocated to each good or service that is identified as a separate performance obligation based on estimated standalone selling prices. This allocation is based on observable prices when the Company sells the good or service separately. The Company has established standalone prices for the System Obligation and maintenance and extended warranty services, as well as for film license arrangements. The Company uses an adjusted market assessment approach for separate performance obligations that do not have standalone selling prices or third-party evidence of estimated standalone selling prices. The Company considers multiple factors including its historical pricing practices, product class, market competition and geography.\nIMAX Theater Systems are based on proprietary and patented image, audio and other technology developed over the course of the Company's 53-year history. The Company's customers are theater exhibitors that operate commercial theaters (particularly multiplexes), museums, science centers, or destination entertainment sites. The Company generally does not own the theaters in the IMAX network, but sells or leases the IMAX Theater System along with a license to use its trademarks.\n * See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below for a description of this non-GAAP financial measure and a reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP amount. \n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nA significant portion of the Company's research and development efforts over the past several years have been focused on IMAX with Laser, the Company's laser-based projection system, which the Company believes delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThrough the Film Distribution segment, the Company licenses film content and distributes large-format films, primarily for its institutional theater partners. The Company receives as its distribution fee either a fixed amount or a fixed percentage of the theater box office receipts and following the Company's recoupment of its costs the Company typically is entitled to receive an additional percentage of gross revenues as participation revenues. The Company released the IMAX original production, Asteroid Hunters, in October 2020.\nEquity Method Investments\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nNew Business Initiatives\nOn July 24, 2020, IMAX (Shanghai) Multimedia Technology Co., Ltd. ( IMAX Shanghai\u201d), one of the Company's majority-owned subsidiaries in China, renewed its unsecured revolving facility for up to 200.0 million Renminbi (approximately $30.6 million) to fund ongoing working capital requirements (the Working Capital Facility\u201d). The facility expires in July 2021. As of December 31, 2020, there was 49.9 million Renminbi ($7.6 million) in borrowings outstanding, 140.1 million Renminbi ($21.5 million) available for future borrowings and 10.0 million Renminbi ($1.5 million) available for letters of guarantees under the Working Capital Facility. There were no amounts drawn under the Working Capital facility at December 31, 2019. The amounts available for borrowing under the Working Capital Facility are not subject to a standby fee. The effective interest rate for the year ended December 31, 2020 was 4.31% (2019 - nil).\nVariable consideration related to indexed minimum payment increases is outside of the Company's control, but the movement in the rates is historically well documented and economic trends in inflation are easily accessible. For each contract subject to an indexed minimum payment increase, the Company estimates the most likely amount using published indices. The amount of the estimated minimum payment increase is then recorded at its present value as of the date of recognition using the customer's implied borrowing rate.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company's principal sources of liquidity included: (i) its balances of cash and cash equivalents ($317.4 million, which reflects the full draw of the Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020); (ii) the anticipated collection of trade accounts receivable, which includes amounts owed under joint revenue sharing arrangements and DMR agreements with movie studios; (iii) the anticipated collection of financing receivables due in the next 12 months; and (iv) installment payments expected in the next 12 months on its existing sales and sales-type lease arrangements in backlog.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates or laws is recognized in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period in which the change is enacted. Investment tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense.\nAs a result of the factors discussed in the previous paragraph, the Company's consolidated results of operations and segment results for the year ended December 31, 2020 materially declined versus the prior year with total revenues and gross margin decreasing by $258.7 million (65%) and $192.7 million (90%), respectively.\n\nThe following tables provide detailed information about the Company's backlog by arrangement type and geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nA reconciliation of net loss attributable to common shareholders, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is presented in the table below. Net loss attributable to common shareholders is the most directly comparable GAAP measure because it reflects the earnings relevant to the Company's shareholders, rather than the earnings attributable to non-controlling interests. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the Company updated its reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to reflect this approach.\nDeferred Income Tax Assets\nIMAX Network\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses\n \u2022 specialized theater acoustics, which result in a four-fold reduction in background noise; and \n\nLong-Lived Assets\nCapital expenditures, including the Company's investment in joint revenue sharing equipment, purchase of property, plant and equipment, other intangible assets and investments in film assets were $16.9 million in 2020 as compared to $74.3 million in 2019.\nStock Options\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported a loss of $1.9 million due to the write-off of deferred tax assets related to an equity method investment, as compared to $nil in 2019 related to its proportionate share of equity investee results.\nConstraints on the Recognition of Variable Consideration\nThe JRSA segment provides IMAX Theater Systems to exhibitors through joint revenue sharing arrangements. Under the traditional form of these arrangements, IMAX provides the IMAX projection and sound system under a long-term lease in which the Company assumes the majority of the equipment and installation costs. In exchange for its upfront investment, the Company earns rent based on a percentage of contingent box office receipts and, in some cases, concession revenues, rather than requiring the customer to pay a fixed upfront fee or annual minimum payments. Rental payments from the customer are required throughout the term of the arrangement and are due either monthly or quarterly. The Company retains title to the IMAX Theater System equipment components throughout the lease term, and the equipment is returned to the Company at the conclusion of the arrangement.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment test considering the latest available information and determined that its goodwill was not impaired. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's total Goodwill was $39.0 million, of which $19.1 million relates to the IMAX Systems reporting unit, $13.5 million relates to the Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangement reporting unit, and $6.4 million relates to the IMAX Maintenance reporting unit.\nIf business conditions deteriorate further, or should they remain depressed for a more prolonged period of time, management's estimates of operating results and future cash flows for the IMAX Systems and Joint Revenue Sharing Arrangements reporting units may be insufficient to support the goodwill assigned to them, thus requiring impairment charges. The Company will continue to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment. In addition, estimates related to future expected credit losses and the recoverability of deferred tax assets, as well as the recoverability of joint revenue sharing equipment assets and the realization of variable consideration assets, could also be further impacted by changes in management's estimates. (see Notes 3, 5 and 12 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8).\nIMAX DMR\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders and adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per basic and diluted share exclude, where applicable: (i) share-based compensation; (ii) COVID-19 government relief benefits; (iii) legal judgment and arbitration awards; (iv) exit costs, restructuring charges and associated impairments; (v) loss in the fair value of investments, as well as the related tax impact of these adjustments, and (vi) income taxes resulting from management's decision to no longer indefinitely reinvest the historical earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries.\nIn addition, certain movies shown in IMAX theaters are filmed using proprietary IMAX film and IMAX certified digital cameras, which offer filmmakers customized guidance and a workflow process to provide further enhanced and differentiated image quality and a film aspect ratio that delivers up to 26% more image onto a movie screen.\nOther Theater Business\nResearch and Development\n \u2022 a license to the globally recognized IMAX brand. \nFinancing Activities\nThe following table provides detailed information about the mix of IMAX Theater System installations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all of its requirements under the Credit Agreement, as amended. The Company's continued compliance with the requirements of the Credit Agreement will depend on the Company's ability to generate sufficient EBITDA to ensure compliance with the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant throughout the next twelve months, which is dependent on the timing of when theaters in the IMAX network resume normal operations. The risk of breaching this covenant within the next twelve months increases significantly as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely impact the Company's ability to generate EBITDA. A violation of this covenant would represent an event of default under the terms of the Credit Agreement, allowing lenders to declare the principal and interest on all outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness due or payable immediately. If a breach of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio covenant were to occur, however, management believes the Company would be able to either reduce a sufficient portion of the drawn amount on the Credit Facility with existing cash balances to achieve compliance, obtain additional sources of liquidity prior to the time when the repayment of its outstanding Credit Facility indebtedness would be required, or negotiate a further amendment with its lenders to the Credit Agreement to provide further covenant relief.\nCredit Facility\nThe following table presents the Company's revenue and gross margin (margin loss) by category and reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n (2) Reflects contractual upfront payments. Future contingent payments are not reflected as these are based on negotiated shares of box office results. \nEBITDA is defined as net income or loss excluding: (i) interest expense, net of interest income; (ii) income tax expense or benefit; and (iii) depreciation and amortization, including film asset amortization. Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility is defined as EBITDA excluding: (i) share-based and other non-cash compensation; (ii) gain or loss in the fair value of investments; (iii) write-downs, net of recoveries, including asset impairments and credit loss expense; (iv) legal judgment and arbitration awards; and (iv) the gain or loss from equity accounted investments.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company also updated its recoverability tests of the carrying values of the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements, which are recorded within Property, Plant and Equipment. In performing its reviews of recoverability, the Company estimated the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. The cash flow estimates used in these tests are consistent with management's estimated long-term projections, against which various sensitivity analyses were performed. These estimates are highly uncertain due to the COVID-19 global pandemic; therefore, management's estimated cash flows factor in a number of underlying variables and ranges of possible cash flow scenarios. Actual results may materially differ from management's estimates, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded impairment losses of $0.3 million related to the theater system equipment supporting its joint revenue sharing arrangements. (See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nWells Fargo Foreign Exchange Facility\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Research and Development expenses increased by $0.4 million (8%), when compared to the prior year, primarily due to costs associated with the Connected Theaters initiative.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe following tables provide detailed information about the Commercial Multiplex theaters in operation within the IMAX network by arrangement type and geographic location as of December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nThe ability of the Company to collect its accounts receivable, financing receivable and variable consideration receivables is heavily dependent on the viability and solvency of individual theater operators which is significantly influenced by consumer behavior and general economic conditions. Theater operators and, in certain situations, movie studios, may experience financial difficulties that could cause them to be unable to fulfill their payment obligations to the Company.\nRevenues and Gross Margin\n(See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d and Risk Factors - The Company has experienced a significant decrease in its revenues, earnings and cash flows due to the COVID-19 global pandemic and its business, financial condition and results of operations may continue to be significantly harmed in future reporting periods\u201d in Part I, Item 1A.)\nFilm Distribution and Post-Production\nRestricted Share Units\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a provision for current expected credit losses of $18.6 million reflecting a reduction in the credit quality of its theater and studio related receivable balances, which management believes is primarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic and adequately addresses the risk of not collecting these receivables in full. Management's judgments regarding expected credit losses are based on the facts available to management and involve estimates about the future. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, its effect on the Company's customers and their ability to meet their financial obligations to the Company is difficult to predict. As a result, the Company's judgments and associated estimates of credit losses may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect. For the year ended December 31, 2019, credit loss expense was $2.4 million. (See Notes 2 and 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.)\nThe Film Post-Production segment provides film post-production and quality control services for large-format films (whether produced by IMAX or third parties), and digital post-production services.\nThe average revenue per IMAX Theater System under sales and sales-type lease arrangements varies depending upon the number of IMAX Theater System commitments with a single respective exhibitor, an exhibitor's location and various other factors. The average revenue per full (i.e., not hybrid) IMAX Theater System under sales and sales-type lease arrangements was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to $1.3 million in the prior year.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a charge of $4.1 million associated with the Final Judgment issued on December 3, 2020 in respect of the Giencourt matter, as discussed in Note 16(c) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. No such charges were incurred in 2019.\nThe Company leverages its innovative technology and engineering in all aspects of its core business, which principally consists of the digital remastering of films and other presentations into the IMAX format ( IMAX DMR\u201d) and the sale or lease of premium IMAX theater systems ( IMAX Theater Systems\u201d).\nIMAX DMR\nThe Company's net cash used in or provided by operating activities is affected by a number of factors, including: (i) the level of cash collections from customers in respect of existing IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements, (ii) the amount of upfront payments collected from newly signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements, (iii) the box-office performance of films distributed by the Company and/or released to IMAX theaters, (iv) the level of inventory purchases and (v) the level of the Company's operating expenses, including expenses for research and development and new business initiatives.\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of its business, the Company will have customers who are unable to proceed with an IMAX Theater System installation for a variety of reasons, including the inability to obtain certain consents, approvals or financing. Once the determination is made that the customer will not proceed with installation, the agreement with the customer is terminated or amended. If the agreement is terminated, once the Company and the customer are released from all their future obligations under the agreement, all or a portion of the initial rents or fees that the customer previously made to the Company are recognized as revenue.\nIn sale arrangements, title to the IMAX Theater System equipment generally transfers to the customer. However, in certain instances, the Company retains title or a security interest in the equipment until the customer has made all payments required by the agreement or until certain shipment events for the equipment have occurred. In a sales-type lease arrangement, title to the IMAX Theater System equipment remains with the Company. The Company has the right to remove the equipment for non-payment or other defaults by the customer.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX DMR revenues and gross margin decreased by $92.5 million (77%) and $64.9 million (83%), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These decreases are due to a $849.3 million (77%) reduction in GBO generated by IMAX DMR films, from $1,108.5 million to $259.2 million, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the year ended December 31, 2020, GBO was generated primarily by the exhibition of 35 films (31 new and 4 carryovers) and the re-release of classic titles, as compared to 72 films (60 new and 12 carryovers) exhibited in 2019.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nMaintenance margins vary depending on the mix of theater system configurations in the theater network, volume-pricing related to larger relationships and the timing and the date(s) of installation and/or service.\nIncome Taxes\n\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe fair value determined by the Monte Carlo Model is affected by the Company's stock price, as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, market conditions as of the grant date, the Company's expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, and other relevant data. The compensation expense is fixed on the date of grant based on the dollar value granted.\nThe Company's Consolidated Financial Statements include the non-controlling interest in the net income (loss) of IMAX China as well as the impact of non-controlling interests in the activity of its Original Film Fund subsidiary. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the net loss attributable to non-controlling interests of the Company's subsidiaries was $13.7 million (2019 \u2500 net income attributable to non-controlling interests of $11.7 million).\nCredit Loss Expense\nIMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance\nIMAX Technology Network\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, cash and cash equivalents increased by $207.9 million principally due to financing cash inflows of $240.6 million, which include the full draw of the Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020, as discussed above. These financing cash inflows are partially offset by $23.0 million of cash used to fund the Company's operating activities as the COVID-19 global pandemic resulted in a significant decline in revenue and earnings. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company invested $9.3 million in equipment to be used in its joint revenue sharing arrangements with exhibitors, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment. Based on management's current operating plan for 2021, the Company expects to continue to use cash to deploy additional IMAX Theater Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements.\nIMPACT OF COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nIMAX Enhanced\nPension and Postretirement Obligations\nThe revenue earned from customers under the Company's theater system sales or lease agreements varies from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors, including the number and mix of theater system configurations sold or leased, the timing of installation of the IMAX Theater Systems, the nature of the arrangement and other factors specific to individual contracts.\nJudgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, and the amount of any required allowance for credit losses, are based on management's initial credit evaluation of the customer and the regular ongoing monitoring of the credit quality of each customer. This monitoring process includes an analysis of collections history and aging for each customer, as well as meetings on at least a monthly basis to identify credit concerns and potential changes in credit quality classification. A customer may improve their credit quality classification once a substantial payment is made on an overdue balance or when the customer has agreed to a payment plan and payments have commenced in accordance with that plan. Changes in credit quality classification are dependent upon management approval. Management's judgments with respect to the collectibility of accounts receivable, financing receivables and variable consideration receivables, and the amount of any required allowance for credit losses, may ultimately prove, with the benefit of hindsight, to be incorrect.\n (1) Represents total payments to be made under binding commitments with suppliers and outstanding payments to be made for supplies ordered, but yet to be invoiced. \n\nThe Company evaluates each of the performance obligations in an IMAX Theater System arrangement to determine which are considered distinct, either individually or in a group, for accounting purposes and which of the deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on the applicable accounting guidance in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d ASC Topic 842, Leases,\u201d and ASC Topic 460, Guarantees\u201d.\nThe transaction price for the System Obligation consists of upfront or initial payments made before and after the final installation of the IMAX Theater System and ongoing payments throughout the term of the arrangement. The Company estimates the transaction price, including an estimate of future variable consideration, received in exchange for the goods delivered or services rendered. The arrangement for the sale of an IMAX Theater System includes indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include amounts owed by the customer based on a percentage of their box office receipts over the term of the arrangement. These contract provisions are considered to be variable consideration under ASC Topic 606. An estimate of the present value of such variable consideration is recognized as revenue upon the transfer of control of the System Obligation to the customer, subject to constraints to ensure that there is not a risk of significant revenue reversal. This estimate is based on management's box office projections for the individual theater, which are developed using historical data for the theater and, if necessary, comparable theaters and territories. Transfer of control of the System Obligation occurs at the earlier of client acceptance of the installation of the IMAX Theater System, including projectionist training, and the opening of the theater to the public.\nIMAX Systems\n(See Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d above for a more detailed discussion of the impacts of the pandemic on the Company's business.)\nThe Company believes that growth in international box office remains an important driver of growth for the Company. To support continued growth in international markets, the Company has sought to bolster its international film strategy, supplementing the Company's film slate of Hollywood DMR titles with appealing local IMAX DMR releases in select markets, particularly in China. During 2019, 18 local language IMAX DMR films were released to the IMAX network, including 14 in China and one in each of Japan, South Korea, India and Russia. The blockbuster Ne Zha: The IMAX Experience was released in China in July 2019 and it is the Company's first Chinese animated local language film title. During 2020, 17 local language IMAX DMR films were released into the IMAX network, including ten in China, three in Russia, three in Japan, and one in South Korea. The Company expects to announce additional local language IMAX DMR films to be released to the IMAX network in 2021.\nFor all IMAX theaters, theater owners or operators are also responsible for paying the Company an annual maintenance and extended warranty fee. Under these arrangements, the Company provides proactive and emergency maintenance services to every theater in its network to ensure that each presentation is up to the highest IMAX quality standard. Annual maintenance fees are paid throughout the duration of the term of the theater agreements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, JRSA contingent rent revenue and gross margin decreased by $58.8 million (77%) and $57.9 million (120%), respectively, when compared to the prior year. These decreases are due to a $429.3 million (77%) reduction in GBO generated by theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements during the current year, from $560.3 million to $131.0 million, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, 890 theaters were operating under joint revenue sharing arrangements, as compared to 870 theaters as of December 31, 2019, an increase of 2%. However, as discussed above, a portion of the theaters in the IMAX network remain closed as of December 31, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, IMAX Systems revenue and gross margin decreased by $53.3 million (50%) and $33.4 million (57%), respectively, when compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. These decreases are principally the result of 28 fewer IMAX Theater System installations and 11 fewer IMAX Theater System upgrades in the current year as the pace of theater system installations slowed significantly due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nResults of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nJoint revenue sharing arrangements also require IMAX to provide maintenance and extended warranty services to the customer over the term of the lease in exchange for a separate fixed annual fee. These fees are reported within IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, as discussed below.\nThe Company issues share-based compensation to eligible employees, directors, and consultants under the IMAX Corporate Second Amended and Restated Long-Term Incentive Plan (as may be amended, the IMAX LTIP\u201d) and the China Long-Term Incentive Plan (the China LTIP\u201d) as summarized below. On June 3, 2020, the Company's shareholders approved the IMAX LTIP at the Company's Annual and Special Meeting. The IMAX LTIP is the Company's governing document and awards to employees, directors, and consultants under this plan may consist of stock options, restricted share units ( RSUs\u201d), performance share units ( PSUs\u201d) and other awards. A separate stock option plan, the China LTIP, was adopted by a subsidiary of the Company in October 2012.\nIMAX DMR digitally enhances the image resolution of motion picture films for projection on IMAX screens while maintaining or enhancing the visual clarity and sound quality to levels for which The IMAX Experience is known. In addition, the original soundtrack of a film to be exhibited in IMAX theaters is remastered for IMAX digital sound systems in connection with the IMAX DMR release of the film. Unlike the soundtracks played in conventional theaters, IMAX remastered soundtracks are uncompressed and full fidelity. IMAX sound systems use proprietary loudspeaker systems and proprietary surround sound configurations that ensure every theater seat is in an optimal listening position.\nThe Company is currently exploring new technologies and forms of content as a way to deepen consumer engagement and brand loyalty, including new technologies to further connect the IMAX network and to facilitate bringing more unique content, including live events, to IMAX theater audiences. The Company believes such additional connectivity can provide more innovative content to the IMAX network and in turn permit the Company to engage audiences in new ways.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Film Distribution and Post-Production revenue and gross margin decreased by $3.5 million (29%) and $8.9 million, respectively, when compared to the prior year. The results for the year are significantly influenced by $10.0 million in impairment losses recorded in the year principally to write-down the carrying value of certain documentary and alternative content film assets due to a decrease in projected box office totals and related revenues based on management's regular quarterly recoverability assessments. As of December 31, 2020, following the recording of these write-downs, the Company's film assets totaled $5.8 million, which principally consists of DMR and documentary content. There can be no assurances that there will not be additional write-downs to the carrying values of these assets as the Company continues to assess the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (see Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8).\nIn 2019, the net cash used in financing activities was principally due to the net repayment of $20.0 million in Credit Facility borrowings, $19.2 million for the repurchase of common shares under the IMAX China share repurchase program, $14.4 million paid to purchase treasury stock for the settlement of restricted share units and related taxes, $4.4 million of dividends paid to the non-controlling interest shareholders of IMAX China, and $2.7 million paid to repurchase common shares under the Company's share repurchase program, partially offset by $2.4 million common shares issued for stock options exercised and $1.1 million received for the issuance of subsidiary shares to non-controlling interests.\nThe revenue earned from customers under the Company's joint revenue sharing arrangements can vary from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of factors including film performance, the mix of theater system configurations, the timing of installation of these IMAX Theater Systems, the nature of the arrangement, the location, size and management of the theater and other factors specific to individual arrangements.\n (3) In addition to revenue from new and upgraded IMAX Theater Systems, revenues earned by the IMAX Systems segment also includes finance income and the impact of renewals and amendments to existing theater system arrangements. \n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. \nNBC Facility\n (1) Includes 46 IMAX Theater Systems (2019 - 47) where the customer has the option to convert from a joint revenue sharing arrangement to a sales arrangement. \nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company did not have any letters of credit and advance payment guarantees outstanding under the Credit Facility.\nThe number of IMAX Theater Systems in the backlog reflects the minimum number of commitments under signed contracts. The dollar value fluctuates depending on the number of new arrangements signed from year-to-year, which adds to backlog and the installation and acceptance of IMAX Theater Systems and the settlement of contracts, both of which reduce backlog. Backlog typically represents the fixed contracted revenue under signed IMAX Theater System sale and lease agreements that the Company believes will be recognized as revenue upon installation and acceptance of the associated system, as well as an estimate of variable consideration in sales arrangements, however it excludes amounts allocated to maintenance and extended warranty revenues. The value of backlog does not include revenue from theaters in which the Company has an equity interest, operating leases and long-term conditional theater commitments. Theaters under joint revenue sharing arrangements do not usually have dollar value backlog, although certain IMAX Theater Systems under joint revenue sharing arrangements provide for contracted upfront payments and therefore carry a backlog value based on those payments. The Company believes that the contractual obligations for IMAX Theater System installations that are listed in backlog are valid and binding commitments.\nAs one of the world's leaders in entertainment technology, the Company strives to remain at the forefront of advancements in cinema technology. In 2018, the Company introduced IMAX with Laser, a laser projection system designed for IMAX theaters in commercial multiplexes, which represents a further evolution of IMAX's proprietary technology. The Company believes that IMAX with Laser delivers increased resolution, sharper and brighter images, deeper contrast as well as the widest range of colors available to filmmakers today. The Company further believes that IMAX with Laser is helping facilitate the next major lease renewal and upgrade cycle for the global IMAX network.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $(143.8) million, or $(2.43) per diluted share, as compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $46.9 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reported an adjusted net loss attributable to common shareholders* of $(112.1) million, or $(1.89) per diluted share*, as compared to adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders* of $64.8 million, or $1.05 per diluted share*, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs discussed above, the Company's significant streams of variable consideration relate to arrangements for the sale of IMAX Theater Systems which include indexed minimum payment increases over the term of the arrangement, as well as the potential for additional payments owed by the customer if certain minimum box office receipt thresholds are exceeded. In addition, hybrid sales arrangements include variable consideration based on a percentage of the customer's box office receipts over the term of the arrangement.\n (1) The Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is calculated using twelve months ended Adjusted EBITDA per Credit Facility. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company entered into the First Amendment to the Credit Facility Agreement which provides for, among other things, the suspension of the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio financial covenant through the first quarter of 2021. For more information see Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. \nTax reserves for uncertain tax positions are adjusted by the Company to reflect management's best estimate of the outcome of examinations and assessments and in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the completion of a tax audit, expiration of a statute of limitations, the refinement of an estimate, and interest accruals associated with the uncertain tax positions until they are resolved. Some of these adjustments require significant judgment in estimating the timing and amount of the additional tax expense.\nThe discussion of the Company's results of operations below compares results for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. A discussion of the Company's results of operations comparing results for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is included under the section entitled Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, and is incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nNon-Controlling Interests\nOn October 28, 2019, the Company entered into a $5.0 million facility with the National Bank of Canada (the NBC Facility\u201d) fully insured by Export Development Canada for use solely in conjunction with the issuance of performance guarantees and letters of credit. The Company did not have any letters of credit and advance payment guarantees outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 under the NBC Facility.\nIn the first quarter of 2019, IMAX China (Hong Kong), Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IMAX China, entered into a cornerstone investment agreement with Maoyan Entertainment ( Maoyan\u201d) and purchased equity securities for $15.2 million. These equity securities are traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, and the Company is required to adjust the fair value of the securities each period to reflect the current market value. This adjustment will fluctuate based on the closing market price at the end of each period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the fair value of the Company's investment in Maoyan resulted in an unrealized loss of $2.1 million, as compared to an unrealized loss of $0.5 million in the prior year, which are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. In February 2021, IMAX China (Hong Kong) sold all of its 7,949,000 shares of Maoyan for gross proceeds of $17.8 million, which represents a $2.6 million gain relative to the Company's acquisition cost. No shares of Maoyan are currently held by IMAX China (Hong Kong).\n (1) Includes 148 new IMAX with Laser projection system configurations and 95 upgrades of existing locations to IMAX with Laser projection system configurations. \nFilm Assets\n \u2022 Adjusted net (loss) income attributable to common shareholders per diluted share; ", "item_7_tables": "Table 146: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>

entertainment technology company that specializes in technologies and innovations for immersive cinema experiences. It earns revenue primarily from its proprietary IMAX Theater Systems and its digital remastering (IMAX DMR) technology.\n\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\n- The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in extended closure of IMAX theaters globally, delays in theater installations, and delays in major Hollywood film releases. This significantly reduced IMAX's revenues, earnings, and cash flows in 2020. There is uncertainty around the timing of theater reopenings and film releases.  \n\nResults of Operations\n- Total revenues decreased 65% and gross margins decreased 90% in 2020 due to the pandemic's impact. The IMAX Technology Network, IMAX Technology Sales and Maintenance, and Film Distribution segments were all negatively impacted. Non-GAAP adjusted net loss was $112 million in 2020, versus adjusted net income of $65 million in 2019.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n- IMAX has taken steps to reduce costs and capital expenditures to preserve cash. The company drew down $280 million from its credit facility in early 2020 to boost liquidity. Compliance with financial covenants could become an issue if theaters remain closed and EBITDA does not recover.\n\nBacklog \n- There were 300 new IMAX theater system signings in 2020, down from 304 in 2019. Installations slowed, with 33 new installs and 95 upgrades in 2020, versus 61 and 106 respectively in 2019. Theater system backlog remains over $300 million.\n\nThat covers the key points from the management's discussion and analysis section.
