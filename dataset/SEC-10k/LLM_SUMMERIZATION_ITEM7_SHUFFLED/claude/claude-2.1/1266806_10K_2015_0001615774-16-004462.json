Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. The consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K and in conjunction with the Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness Overview\nWe were founded in 1998 with a mission to develop, manufacture, and market prosthetic devices that restore vision to the blind. Our principal offices are located in Sylmar, California, approximately 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. We also have an office in Lausanne, Switzerland that manages our commercial and clinical operations in Europe and the Middle East.\nOur first commercial product, the Argus II System, is a retinal prosthesis that can provide some functional vision to individuals blinded by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The Argus II System is an implantable neurostimulation device that uses electrical stimulation of the retina (based on a wireless video camera feed) to replace the function of the defunct photo-receptors in RP patients.\nOur major corporate, clinical and regulatory milestones include:\nTable 167: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 1998, we were founded. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 168: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 2002, we commenced clinical trials for our prototype product, the Argus I retinal prosthesis. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 169: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 2006, we commenced clinical trials for the Argus II System, which later became our first commercial product. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 170: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 2007, we commenced clinical trials in the US for the Argus II System, which later became our first commercial product. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 171: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 2011, we received marketing approval in Europe (CE Mark) for the Argus II System. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 2013, we received marketing approval in the United States (FDA) for the Argus II System. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 173: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 2014, we completed our initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol EYES.\u201d </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>In 2015, we commenced a clinical trial in the UK for an expanded indication for the Argus II System in individuals with dry AMD. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe began selling the Argus II System in Europe at the end of 2011, in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and in the United States and Canada in 2014, and in Turkey in 2015. We have limited regulatory approval in Canada and Saudi Arabia, and we are currently applying for full approval. To date, all of our sales have been made by our direct sales force, but we plan to add partners and distributors to enhance our coverage of existing and future markets. In 2014, we entered into our first distribution agreements, that cover the countries of Spain and Turkey, and we are at various stages of negotiations with a number of other distributors for countries in Europe and the Middle East.\nGoing Concern\nFrom inception, our operations have been funded primarily through the sales of our common stock, as well as from the issuance of convertible debt, research and clinical grants, and product revenue generated by the sale of our Argus II System. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we funded our business primarily through:\nTable 175: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Revenue of $8.9 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, generated by sales of our Argus II System, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 176: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Issuance of convertible debt with the face value of $19.5 million in 2013, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 177: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>A $4.1 million grant under Joint Research and Development Agreement with The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in 2014, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 178: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Issuance of common stock in a private placements aggregating $9.1 million and $2.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 179: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in November 2014, which generated net proceeds of $34.2 million of cash after offering expenses. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 180: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur financial statements have been presented on the basis that our business is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with one product line and limited commercial product revenues, including limitations on our operating capital resources and uncertain demand for our products. We have incurred recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our 2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn January 25, 2016, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct a registered rights offering as of a future record date to allow the holders of our common stock to purchase newly-issued shares of common stock. The shares will be offered at the lower of $4.25 per share or 85% of the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the last day of the offering period. Assuming full subscription and a closing stock price of between $4.00 and $6.00 per share on the last day of the offering period, we expect to sell between 4.6 million and 5.8 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $19.8 million. The actual number of shares sold and proceeds raised will depend on, among other factors, the extent to which current shareholders participate in the rights offering and the final price per share at which we sell our common stock. We intend to use the proceeds from this rights offering to invest in our business to expand sales and marketing efforts, enhance current products, gain regulatory approvals for additional indications, and continue research and development into next generation technology.\nWe have received verbal assurances from two shareholders, one of whom is currently a director of the Company, and the other of whom is an affiliate of an early investor in the Company, that they will each exercise their subscription rights in full. In addition, to the extent that other shareholders do not exercise their subscription rights in full, these two shareholders have also provided verbal assurances to us that they will exercise their respective over-subscription privileges at the subscription price, to allow these shareholders to make an aggregate investment in us of up to $12.75 million. Accordingly, the rights offering is expected to raise a minimum of $12.75 million and a maximum of approximately $19.8 million in gross proceeds. We expect that the rights offering may close during the second quarter of 2016. The director/shareholder has also been granted the right, but not the obligation, to provide all of the remaining unsubscribed amounts, up to the aggregate balance of the amount not taken up in the rights offering by our other shareholders. We believe that these two shareholders have the financial capability to meet these financial commitments to us as described herein.\nNo assurances can be given that we will ultimately be successful in completing this rights offering, or if unsuccessful, that we will be able to raise sufficient funds through other means so as to be able to continue operating our business at current levels beyond the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInsurance Reimbursement\nObtaining reimbursement from governmental and private insurance companies is critical to our future commercial success. Due to the cost of the Argus II System, our sales would be limited without the availability of third party reimbursement. In the US, coding, coverage, and payment are necessary for the surgical procedure and Argus II system to be reimbursed by payers. Coding has been established for the device and the surgical procedure. Coverage and payment vary by payer. Argus II patients are eligible for Medicare, and coverage is primarily provided through traditional Medicare (sometimes referred to as Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS)) or Medicare Advantage. A small percentage of patients are covered by commercial insurers.\nTable 181: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Medicare FFS patients - Coverage is determined by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) that administer various geographic regions of the US. As of March 1, 2016, five of 12 MACs (17 states, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands) have made positive coverage decisions for the Argus II. Effective January 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established a New Technology Ambulatory Payment Class (APC) 1599, Level 48, with a payment rate of $95,000 for both the procedure and the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. From October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, the Argus II was classified as having pass-through payment status and the device was paid separately from the procedure. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 183: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Medicare Advantage patients - Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same benefits as those covered by the MAC in that jurisdiction. For example, if a MAC in a jurisdiction has favorable coverage for the Argus II, then all Medicare Advantage plans in that MAC jurisdiction are required to offer the same coverage for the Argus II. Individual hospitals and ASCs may negotiate Medicare Advantage contracts specific to that individual facility, which may include additional separate payment for the Argus II implant system. In addition, procedural payment is variable and can be based on a percentage of billed charges, payment groupings or other individually negotiated payment methodologies. Medicare Advantage plans also allow providers to confirm coverage and payment for the Argus II procedure in advance of implantation. In 2015, 93% or 13 of 14 Medicare Advantage pre-authorization requests were granted. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 184: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Commercially insured patients - Commercial insurance plans make coverage and payment rate decisions independent of Medicare decisions and contracts are individually negotiated with facility and physician providers. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn 2015, 32 individuals in the US and Canada received and were implanted with the Argus II technology. Of these, nine were Medicare FFS patients, 13 were Medicare Advantage patients and three were commercially insured patients. The remaining seven patients were covered by private pay, Veteran's Administration, or other insurers.\nA significant focus for 2016, and beyond, will be expanding US reimbursement coverage and working with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish Medicare hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center payment rates that are in line with facility costs. We have individuals working at Second Sight dedicated to reimbursement and employ a variety of consultants with expertise in this field. Currently, five MACs that oversee 17 states and two US Territories have agreed to cover the Argus II System when medically necessary for the FDA approved indications. The MACs now covering the Argus II include First Coast Service Options (covers on a case-by-case basis for Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands), CGS Administrators, LLC (for the states of Ohio and Kentucky), Palmetto GBA (for the states of North and South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia, other than the counties of Arlington and Fairfax in Virginia and the City of Arlington in Virginia), National Government Services, Inc. (NGS), Jurisdiction 6 (for the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), and NGS, Jurisdiction K (for the states of Connecticut, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont). We are actively engaged with the remaining MACs and are committed to providing them with clinical evidence to support our requests for coverage. We expect that additional positive coverage decisions will be issued over time but cannot predict timing or ultimate success with each MAC.\nWe are actively engaged with CMS concerning the outpatient payment rate for Medicare FFS patients. As discussed above, the 2016 Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate for the Argus procedure is $95,000. Based on available cost information, the Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate should be at least $150,000 to fully cover the hospitals' costs for the device and procedure (with physician fees being billed and reimbursed separately). Our efforts have been focused on changing the 2016 payment rate to be more reflective of hospitals' actual costs. As of March 1, 2016, we are operating our business with the belief that the US outpatient payment rate will remain $95,000 in 2016. In parallel, the company is focused on obtaining a 2017 outpatient payment rate that adequately covers hospital costs. Several paths exist to accomplishing this goal including continued education of hospitals concerning the importance of properly coding, billing and submitting Argus II Medicare claims. This activity is important to establish an accurate claims data base that CMS will use to set future payment rates. Finally, the company is exploring other options for changes to Medicare payment policy that may facilitate appropriate reimbursement. No assurance can be given that the company will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nWithin Europe, we have obtained reimbursement approval in Germany, France and two regions of Italy. We also are seeking reimbursement approval in other countries including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey. In France, Second Sight was selected to receive the first \"Forfait Innovation\" (Innovation Bundle) from the Ministry of Health, which is a special funding program for breakthrough procedures to be introduced into clinical practice. As part of this program, Second Sight is conducting a post-market study in France which will enroll a total of 18 subjects and follow them for two years. The French program will fund implantation of up to 18 additional patients that will not be part of the post-market study. After review of the study's results, we expect Argus II therapy to be covered and funded through the standard payment system in France, however, we can provide no assurance that the French government will continue to fund the Argus II after the first 36 implants.\nTo date, we have not faced traditional sales challenges in any of our markets, largely due to the currently unmet clinical need and the lack of any other available device or competitive treatment for RP-caused profound blindness. Our marketing activities have focused on raising awareness of the Argus II System with potential patients, implanting physicians, and referring physicians. Our marketing activities include exhibiting, sponsoring symposia, and securing podium presence at professional and trade shows, securing journalist coverage in popular and trade media, attending patient meetings focused on educating patients about existing and future treatments, and sponsoring information sessions for the Argus II System. In the US, our efforts in 2016 will focus on presenting media ads dedicated to RP patients and their families. These ads will be placed in geographic areas where we have proven implanting centers and established reimbursement. Based on pilot efforts we conducted in 2015 we believe this may be a cost-efficient method to connect qualified patients with Argus II implanting centers. As of March 1, 2016 as a result of these efforts the Company had a patient interest list with over 150 conditionally qualified individuals.\nProduct and Clinical Development Plans\nWe are currently working on new external hardware and software for our Argus II System, which we believe may improve the performance characteristics, ease of use and resolution of the system. In the first half of 2016, we plan to introduce new clinical software to be used for adjusting the Argus II that we believe will help clinicians with the initial programming and follow up training of patients. In early 2017, we plan to introduce new eyewear and a new VPU that will allow us to implement some software enhancements that may improve the performance of the Argus II System. For example, improving the resolution of the system may enhance the user experience and increase our potential market size. Improved image resolution may be achieved by enhanced image processing, including contrast enhancement and electronic zooming.\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCurrently, our Argus II System is approved for persons suffering from RP. We believe we may be able to expand the market for the Argus II System beyond RP to patients with severe to profound vision loss due to dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. We are currently enrolling and implanting patients in a pilot study, of about five patients, to evaluate the safety and benefit of the Argus II System for use in persons suffering from AMD. Based on the results from this study, we could begin a larger scale efficacy trial. The size and timing of the pivotal study are dependent on multiple factors including the actual subset of AMD patients we target and whether we decide to modify the Argus II system prior to commencing a pivotal study. The subset of patients will influence the regulatory and reimbursement pathways, the size of the study and the length of time required to enroll the study. The company is also evaluating the potential benefits of system changes optimized for AMD. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in any of these endeavors. If the Argus II System is successfully developed and approved for sale to treat AMD, as to which there can be no assurances, we believe that the potential addressable market opportunity for that device will significantly exceed our existing RP markets for the Argus II System.\nWe are also conducting preclinical development, including animal studies, of a product for cortical stimulation that we refer to as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis (or Orion I\u201d), which we expect will be able to provide some vision restoration to individuals with almost all unpreventable forms of blindness. Our objective in designing and developing the Orion I is to bypass the retina and optic nerve and to directly stimulate the visual cortex region of the brain. Human clinical testing is likely to take the form of a feasibility study followed by a premarket approval pivotal trial. The details of these trials will be determined collaboratively with the FDA at that time. We cannot accurately estimate the timing or exact cost of these trials at this time. If the Orion I is successfully developed and approved for sale, as to which there can be no assurances, we believe that the potential addressable market opportunity for that device will greatly exceed our existing RP markets for the Argus II System.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. Based on the FASB's Exposure Draft Update issued on April 29, 2015, and approved in July 2015, Revenue from Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2014-09 is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating ASU 2014-9, and has not yet determined its impact to the Company's financial statements, nor decided the transition approach it will take.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management's evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nTable 186: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-01 (ASU 2015-01), Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20). ASU 2015-01 eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. Presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item. Paragraph 225-20-45-2 contains the following criteria that must both be met for extraordinary classification: (1) Unusual nature. The underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the entity, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates. (2) Infrequency of occurrence. The underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates. If an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the guidance prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02), Consolidation (Topic 810). ASU 2015-02 changes the guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation mode. ASU 2015-02 affects the following areas: (1) limited partnerships and similar legal entities; (2) evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest; (3) the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination; (4) the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination; and (5) certain investment funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the guidance in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 (ASU 2015-03), Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the new guidance. ASU 2015-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. An entity is required to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented is adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (i.e., debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). The adoption of ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 (ASU 2015-17), Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have any impact on Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 regarding leases. The new standard requires lessee recognition on the balance sheet of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. It further requires recognition in the income statement of a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis. Finally, it requires classification of all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. It is effective for fiscal years commencing after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. Management has not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nTable 187: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. See Note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition.\u2003The Company's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of its Argus II retinal implant, which is implanted during retinal surgery to restore some functional vision to patients blinded by Retinitis Pigmentosa. The Company sells to a variety of customers including university hospitals, large medical centers and distributors.\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectability is probable, and delivery has occurred.\nRevenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple deliverables (multiple-element arrangements), comprising the following deliverables:\nTable 188: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Hospital start up kits (one per site), </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 189: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Surgical support, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 190: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Training, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 191: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>The Argus II System </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe deliverables may vary by transaction.\nThe Company evaluates each deliverable in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within the Company's control. The Company has determined that the elements listed above do not have standalone value to the customer until delivery of all components has occurred. Accordingly, revenue from multiple-element arrangements is recognized when delivery of all of deliverables has taken place and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Generally, revenue recognition occurs at the time of implantation, but revenue recognition can be delayed if certain training has not been delivered to the implanting sites, or if other revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\nIn the United States, the amount of revenue recognized per unit has been limited in some situations due to the uncertainties of the reimbursement environment and payment terms. In such cases, revenue is not recognized until the consideration becomes fixed, generally when paid to the Company.\nIn order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured, the Company assesses a number of factors, including creditworthiness of the customer and medical insurance coverage. The Company may periodically grant extended payment terms to customers. In such situations, the Company defers the recognition of revenue until collection becomes probable, which is generally upon receipt of payment.\nThe Company also sells surgical supplies to customers and recognizes revenue on these products when they are shipped and other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nThe Company sells through distributors in certain countries. The Company provides these distributors with clinical start-up kits, surgical supplies and the Argus II System, as well as training them to provide pre- and post-surgical support. The Company monitors the surgery. Other than surgical support which is provided by the Company, the distributor is responsible for delivering products and services to its customers. In the past, the Company has allowed distributors to return or exchange products in certain situations. Due to the Company's continuing involvement and its returns policy, the Company recognizes revenue from distributors when the implantation procedure has been performed by the distributor's customer, and all other revenue recognition criteria between the Company and the distributor have been met.\nStock-Based Compensation.\u2003Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 718 Share-Based Payment ( ASC 718\u201d), the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards. Under ASC 718, the Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term.\nTable 192: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 193: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The grant price of the issuances, with certain exceptions, is determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the date of grant. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 194: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>The risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 195: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>As permitted by SAB 107, due to the Company's insufficient history of option activity, management utilizes the simplified approach to estimate the options expected term, which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 196: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Volatility is determined based on average historical volatilities of comparable companies in similar industry. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 197: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Expected dividend yield is based on current yield at the grant date or the average dividend yield over the historical period.

Due to the uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on Company's research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal, filing fees and other costs, including internally generated costs, are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nConvertible Promissory Notes and Warrants.\u2003The warrants and embedded beneficial conversion feature of convertible promissory notes are classified as equity under FASB ASC Topic 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity\u201d. The Company allocates the proceeds of the convertible promissory notes between convertible promissory notes and the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes based on their relative fair values at the commitment date. The fair value of the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the respective allocated proceeds to the warrants is recorded in additional paid-in capital. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the same valuation assumptions as described herein for Stock Based Compensation. The embedded beneficial conversion feature associated with convertible promissory notes is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20 Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options.\u201d The portion of debt discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is being amortized over the life of the convertible promissory notes. For the portion of debt discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the beneficial conversion feature, it is amortized over the term of the notes from the respective dates of issuance.\nLong Term Investor Right.\u2003Each beneficial owner ( IPO Shareholder\u201d) of the Company's common stock, who purchased shares directly in the offering ( IPO Shares\u201d), may qualify to receive up to one additional share of common stock from the Company for each share purchased in the offering ( IPO Supplemental Shares\u201d) pursuant to the Long Term Investor Right that was included with each IPO Share. To qualify for receipt of IPO Supplemental Shares, an IPO Shareholder was required to take action to become the direct registered owner of its IPO Shares within 90 days following the closing date of the offering, or by February 22, 2015. Furthermore, IPO Shareholders are required to hold their IPO Shares in their own name and not place them in street name\u201d or trade them at any time during the 24 month period immediately following the IPO closing date. This Long Term Investors Right is non-detachable and transferable only in limited circumstances.\nThe Company will issue IPO Supplemental Shares to IPO Shareholders who have not otherwise forfeited their Long Term Investor Right if, during the two-year period immediately following the IPO closing date, the Company's common stock does not trade at or above $18.00 per share (200% of the IPO price per share) for any five consecutive day period. If the Company's common stock trades on its principal exchange at 200% of the IPO price per share or greater on five consecutive trading days during the two years after the IPO closing date, the Long Term Investor Right will terminate.\nThe formula to determine the number of IPO Supplemental Shares to be issued on a trigger of the Long Term Investor Right will be: (i) $18.00 minus (ii) the average of the highest consecutive closing prices in any 90 day trading period on the principal exchange during the two years after the Closing Date (the Measurement Average\u201d) divided by the Measurement Average. Fractional shares issuable to a qualifying IPO Shareholder resulting from the calculation will be rounded up to the next whole share of common stock, taking into account the aggregate number of Long Term Investor Rights of a holder. As an illustrative example, if the highest average of consecutive closing prices over any 90 calendar day period is $10.00 per share, each Long-Term Investor Right will be entitled to 0.80 additional shares of common stock, which is calculated as: ($18.00 - $10.00)/$10.00.\nTable 198: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe IPO offering price for purposes of the calculation of the amount of common stock to be issued on a Long Term Investor Right will be subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization, recapitalization or split-up of the Company's shares, the issuance of a stock dividend or any similar event. The amount of IPO Supplemental Shares, if any, to be issued will be computed by an independent public accountant as soon as practicable following the second anniversary of the Closing Date. The determination by such independent public accountant will be final and binding on the Company and on all qualifying IPO Shareholders and the Company will within about 15 days after receipt of written determination deliver to shareholders certificates evidencing the additional shares.\nThe Company has identified and will track IPO Investors who have perfected their Rights on a quarterly basis. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will disclose the potential dilutive effect of the Right, including the number of common shares that would be issuable on such date, based on the actual share price movements since the IPO.\nThe Right is an equity instrument that is accounted for as a component of the actual price per common share paid by the investor in the IPO. For basic earnings per share, the common shares associated with the Right are treated as contingently issuable shares and will not be included in basic earnings per share until the actual number of shares can be calculated and the shares have been issued.\nResults of Operations\nNet sales.\u2003Our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of our Argus II System. We began selling our products in Europe in 2011, Saudi Arabia in 2012, in the United States and Canada in 2014, and in Turkey in 2015. Our objective is to increase our product revenue over the next several years as we pursue commercialization of our product, as our product becomes more well-known and accepted in the market, and as insurance coverage becomes more widespread.\nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales includes the salaries, benefits, material, overhead, third party costs, warranty, charges for excess and obsolete inventory, and other costs required to make our Argus II System at our Sylmar, California facility. Historically, our cost of sales has been greater than our revenues, which has resulted in gross losses. However, in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 and for all of fiscal 2015, due to higher revenues and increased manufacturing output and efficiencies, we generated a positive gross margin. Our product involves new and technologically complex materials and processes. As we move from making small quantities of our product for clinical trials to larger quantities for commercial distribution, we are developing new manufacturing techniques and processes that we expect to allow us to scale production. We are currently experiencing low yields on our manufacturing process, but we expect that over the next few years we will be able to refine our processes and improve our manufacturing yields. Accordingly, as we produce in quantities sufficient to support our commercial efforts, we expect that we will generate a positive gross profit.\nOperating Expenses.\u2003We generally recognize our operating expenses as we incur them in four general operational categories: research and development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating expenses also include a non-cash component related to the amortization of deferred stock-based compensation allocated to research and development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing and general and administrative personnel. From time to time we have received grants from institutions or agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, to help fund the some of the cost of our development efforts. We have recorded these grants as offsets to the costs as they are incurred to complete the related work.\nTable 199: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and consulting costs related to the design, development, and enhancements of our current and potential future products, offset by grant revenue received in support of specific research projects. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future products, such as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis. We also expect to receive additional grants in the future that will be offset primarily against research and development costs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 200: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>Clinical and regulatory expenses consist primarily of salaries, travel and related expenses for personnel engaged in clinical and regulatory functions, as well as internal and external costs associated with conducting clinical trials and maintaining relationships with regulatory agencies.

We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operate as a public company. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense was a non-cash expense associated with the Company's convertible promissory notes. Simple interest was accrued at 7.5% per annum based on the face value of the convertible promissory notes outstanding during the year. The accrued interest was added to the amount of outstanding debt, but does not earn additional interest. The terms of the convertible promissory notes provided for automatic conversion of principal and accrued interest into equity on our IPO, at $5.00 per share. Accordingly, subsequent to our IPO in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company no longer incurred interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nAmortization of discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003As discussed more fully above, our convertible promissory notes issued during 2012 and 2013 were issued with detachable warrants and an embedded beneficial conversion feature, which were recorded as an issuance discount with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. This issuance discount was amortized as a non-cash charge over the term of the convertible promissory note. The terms of the convertible promissory notes provided for conversion into equity on an IPO, at $5.00 per share. At December 31, 2013, the unamortized issuance cost related to our convertible promissory notes was $12.0 million. As a result of our IPO in November 2014, $7.0 million of unamortized issuance costs were charged to income due to the automatic conversion of all outstanding convertible promissory notes into common stock.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and\nNet Sales.\u2003Our net sales increased from $3.4 million in 2014 to $8.9 million in 2015, an increase of $5.5 million, or 162%. This increase in net sales was primarily due to selling 75 Argus II systems that were implanted in 2015 compared to 29 in 2014. Average revenue recognized per implant was fairly constant at approximately $119,000 in 2015 compared to $117,000 in 2014. In 2015, there were 43 implants in Europe and the Middle East (EMEA) compared to 13 implants in the prior year. The increase in implants in EMEA is primarily attributable to reimbursement programs in France and Italy, which combined accounted for 31 implants in 2015 compared to three in the 2014. In the United States and Canada (North America), implants increased to 32 in 2015 compared to 16 in 2014. We began selling the Argus II in North America in 2014, and the growth in 2015 represents the positive results of our ongoing commercial efforts.\nThe amount of revenue recognized per implant in a period depends on several factors, including reimbursement policies set by private and government payers, the mix of implants between EMEA and North America, exchange rates, payment terms that may affect revenue recognition, and sales of ancillary products, such as clinical start-up kits and surgical supplies. Given the recent CMS pricing decision discussed above, we made the determination in late February 2016 to temporarily discount the Argus device in the US to approximately $92,000 compared to the $144,000 we sold the product for in 2015. Accordingly, we expect that our average revenue per implant will be lower in 2016 than it was in 2015. The actual impact of this pricing decision on our average revenue will depend on the number of US patients implanted with the Argus II in a given period. Beyond 2016, our average revenue per implant may increase if we are successful in negotiating with CMS to increase the Medicare FFS reimbursement rate for the Argus II System. No assurance can be given, however, that we will be successful in doing so.\nPrior to offering these discounts, our business was negatively impacted during the first two months of 2016 by the difference between our selling price and the 2016 payment rate for Medicare patients. More specifically, we believe several Medicare cases and one planned implanting center opening were delayed due to reimbursement concerns. Given these reimbursement concerns in the U.S. and the inherent variability in our results, we now expect our Q1 2016 implants will be in a range of between 10 and 14 implants worldwide. This expected range is down from the 19 worldwide implants reported in the first quarter of 2015. Most of this expected shortfall is attributable to the US market. With U.S. discounts in place, we should see implant levels rebound in upcoming quarters as we open new centers, qualify more patients and benefit from expanded reimbursement coverage.\nIn the United States, the amount of sales revenue recognized per unit has been limited in some situations due to the uncertainties of the reimbursement environment and payment terms. Favorable claims outcomes and the development of positive coverage policies in the United States may eventually result in greater and earlier revenue recognition.\nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales increased from $3.6 million in 2014 to $5.3 million in 2015, an increase of $1.7 million or 47%. This increase is primarily due to increasing our production volume and yields in 2015 relative to 2014, resulting in more finished goods and sub-assemblies being accepted into inventory and a lower level of scrapped product being expensed. As we manufacture more products, our manufacturing overhead is spread over more units and our cost per unit produced decreases. Also, as our yields improve and we accept more units into inventory, the amount of scrapped product that is written off to cost of sales decreases. We will continue to invest in improving our manufacturing processes. However, if we produce fewer units in 2016, our cost per unit produced could increase. Additionally, our lower expected revenue per implant in 2016, as discussed above, will most likely lead to lower gross margins being recognized in 2016 than in 2015.\nTable 204: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expense.\u2003Research and development expense decreased from $5.0 million in 2014 to $3.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 40%. The decrease is primarily attributable to utilizing $1.9 million of grant funding from The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to offset labor, consulting and overhead costs incurred during 2015 compared to no grant funding in the prior year. To date, we have recognized $1.9 million out of a total $4.1 million related to this grant. We expect research and development costs to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future cortical implant product.\nClinical and regulatory expense.\u2003Clinical and regulatory expense increased from $2.6 million in 2014 to $3.5 million in 2015, an increase of $0.9 million, or 35%. This increase is primarily attributable to the cost of post-market and other clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of our current product, to assess possible enhancements to our existing product, and to assess the efficacy of our technology for treating blindness due to Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\nSelling and marketing expense.\u2003Selling and marketing expense increased from $6.8 million in 2014 to $8.9 million in 2015, an increase of $2.1 million or 31%. This increase in costs is attributable to an increase in personnel, as well as higher costs for marketing and customer awareness programs, as we increased our efforts to commercialize the Argus II System. Beginning in 2014, we began selling our product in the United States, Canada and Spain. These costs increased as we intensified our selling and marketing efforts to accelerate the commercialization of our product, but we expect selling and marketing expense to decrease over time when expressed as a percentage of product revenue.\nGeneral and administrative expense.\u2003General and administrative expense increased from $6.6 million in 2014 to $8.2 million in 2015, an increase of $1.6 million, or 24%. This increase is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of higher stock-based compensation charges in 2015, $0.5 million in higher compensation costs, as well as higher legal, accounting, insurance and regulatory costs associated with being a public company.\nInterest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense on the convertible promissory notes decreased from $2.0 million in 2014 to $0 in 2015. This decrease is due to the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, when all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company did not incur interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nAmortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes decreased from $5.1 million in 2014 to $0 in 2015. This decrease is due to the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, when all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company did not incur the amortization of issuance discount on the convertible promissory notes\nWrite-off of unamortized discount on conversion of convertible promissory notes.\u2003The original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes specified that the notes automatically converted into common stock of the Company in the event, among other things, of an IPO. Accordingly, as of the IPO date, the Company wrote off $7.0 million of deferred issuance costs related to the convertible promissory notes that converted into common stock.\nNet loss.\u2003The net loss was $35.2 million in 2014, as compared to $20.0 million in 2015. The $15.2 million reduction in net loss from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to approximately $14.1 million of non-cash charges related to convertible debt and the conversion of convertible debt into common stock as a result of the Company's IPO in November 2014. These expenses include approximately $2.0 million in non-cash interest expense, $5.1 million for the amortization of debt issuance discounts, and $7.0 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance discounts.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and\nNet Sales.\u2003Our net sales increased from $1.6 million in 2013 to $3.4 million in 2014, an increase of $1.8 million or 113%. This increase in product revenue was due to selling more implants in 2014 and attaining a higher average selling price for implanted devices. We sold 29 Argus II Systems that were implanted in 2014, compared to 22 in the prior year. In 2013, all implants were in Europe and the Middle East, whereas in 2014, there were 16 implants in the United States and Canada and 13 in Europe and the Middle East. The decrease in implants in Europe and the Middle East during 2014, as compared to 2013, is primarily due to sites in Italy and Saudi Arabia, which together accounted for 10 implants in 2013, performing no implants in the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, before resuming activity with a combined 4 implants in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in average selling price in 2014 was primarily due to establishing a higher selling price on the introduction of the Argus II system in the United States and Canada, combined with a lower level of discounting and free goods in Europe in comparison to 2013.\nTable 205: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales decreased from $5.6 million in 2013 to $3.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 36%. This decrease is primarily due to increasing our production volume and yields in 2014 relative to 2013, resulting in more finished goods and sub-assemblies being accepted into inventory and a lower level of scrapped product being expenses. As we manufacture more products, our manufacturing overhead is spread over more units and our cost per unit produced decreases. Also, as our yields improve and we accept more units into inventory, the amount of scrapped product that is written off to cost of sales decreases. We will continue to invest in improving our manufacturing processes, and we expect that manufacturing yields will improve and cost of sales will decrease relative to our revenues over the next few years, although we expect significant fluctuations on a quarter to quarter basis.\nResearch and development expense.\u2003Research and development expense increased from $3.2 million in 2013 to $5.0 million in 2014, an increase of $1.8 million, or 56%. This increase in expense is primarily related to work developing our next generation externals, which includes new eyewear and a new video processing unit. In 2014, we spent $0.9 million more on salaries and other compensation costs than in 2013, and we spent $0.3 million more on materials, consulting services and other supplies to make and evaluate prototypes. We expect research and development costs to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future cortical implant product.\nClinical and regulatory expense.\u2003Clinical and regulatory expense decreased from $3.2 million in 2013 to $2.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 19%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of staffing in 2014 compared to 2013. We expect clinical and regulatory costs to increase in the future as we conduct clinical trials to assess possible enhancements to our existing product, and to assess the safety and efficacy of our current product for treating blindness due to age related macular degeneration.\nSelling and marketing expense.\u2003Selling and marketing expense increased from $3.3 million in 2013 to $6.8 million in 2014, an increase of $3.5 million, or 106%. This increase in costs is attributable to an increase in personnel, as well as higher costs for marketing and customer awareness programs, as we increased our efforts to commercialize the Argus II System as, beginning in 2014, we began selling our product in the United States, Canada and Spain. While we expect these costs to increase in the future as we increase our selling and marketing resources to accelerate the commercialization of our product, we expect selling and marketing expense to decrease over time when expressed as a percentage of product revenue.\nGeneral and administrative expense.\u2003General and administrative expense increased from $4.2 million in 2013 to $6.6 million in 2014, an increase of $2.4 million or 57%. This increase is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of higher stock-based compensation charges in 2014, $0.8 million in higher compensation costs, which includes $0.4 million due to forgiveness of a loan receivable to an officer to finance stock options, $0.2 million of expense related to a stock award to the Company's Chairman, as well as higher spending on patent and audit related fees. The stock-based compensation charge in 2014 includes $0.6 million related to option grants to our chief executive officer. After we become a public company, we expect our general and administrative costs to increase as we incur the additional costs of being a public company, including higher legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing, and other costs.\nInterest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense on the convertible promissory notes increased from $1.6 million in 2013 to $2.0 million in 2014, an increase of $0.4 million, or 25%. This increase is due to the higher average level of debt outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013, although the debt was only outstanding for ten and one-half months in 2014. As a result of the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company no longer incurred interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nAmortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes increased from $3.4 million in 2013 to $5.1 million in 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 50%. This increase is due to the higher average level of debt outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013, although the debt was only outstanding for ten and one-half months in 2014, and to higher value attributed to the beneficial conversion feature associated with promissory notes issued during 2013, but which was only outstanding for a part of 2013. As a result of the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company will no longer incur the amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\nWrite-off of unamortized discount on conversion of convertible promissory notes.\u2003The original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes specified that the notes automatically converted into common stock of the Company in the event, among other things, of an IPO. Accordingly, as of the IPO date, the Company wrote off $7.0 million of deferred issuance costs related to the convertible promissory notes that converted into common stock.\nTable 206: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet loss.\u2003The net loss was $23.0 million in 2013, as compared to $35.2 million in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur company's consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and have financed our working capital requirements through the recurring sale of our equity securities in both public and private offerings. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its current report on our 2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern (see Going Concern\u201d above\u201d).\nOn November 18, 2014, we sold 4,025,000 shares of common stock in an IPO, including 525,000 shares sold upon exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option, at a price of $9.00 per share. Our net proceeds totaled $34.2 million after cash offering costs of $2.0 million, and excluding non-cash costs of $2.9 million for the fair value of warrants and common stock issued in connections with services rendered.\nIn accordance with the original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes, the notes converted into the Company's common stock upon the Company's IPO. In November 2014, convertible promissory notes with a face value of $29.5 million, plus accrued interest of $3.7 million, converted into 6.6 million shares of common stock.\nWorking capital was $18.8 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $33.5 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $14.7 million or 44.0%. Working capital was $33.5 million at December 31, 2014, as compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2013, an increase of $24.4 million or 268%. We use our cash, money market funds and working capital to fund our operating activities.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nDuring 2015, we used $20.6 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $20.0 million, offset by non-cash charges of $3.3 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million. This compares to 2014, when we used $17.1 million of cash in operating activities, consisting of a net loss of $35.2 million, offset by a non-cash charge of $6.9 million for the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the automatic conversion of convertible debt triggered by our IPO, reduced by non-cash charges of $9.6 million for amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, a stock grant to a related party, common stock issued for services, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million.\nDuring 2014, we used $17.1 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $35.2 million, offset by non-cash charges of $6.9 million for the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the automatic conversion of convertible debt triggered by our IPO, $9.6 million for amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, a stock grant to a related party, common stock issued for services, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. This compares to 2013, when we used $17.4 million of cash in operating activities, consisting of a net loss of $23.0 million, reduced by non-cash charges of $6.1 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, and non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, and increased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nInvesting activities in 2015 provided $17.5 million of cash, reflecting $18.3 million in proceeds from money market investments offset by $0.8 million for the purchase of equipment.\nInvesting activities in 2014 used $25.9 million of cash, reflecting $25.4 million in purchases of money market investments and $0.5 million for the purchase of equipment.\nInvesting activities in 2013 used $4.5 million of cash, reflecting $4.3 million in purchases of money market investments and $0.2 million used to purchase property and equipment in 2013.\nTable 207: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $2.8 million of cash in 2015, including $2.7 million from stock option and warrant exercises, issuance of common stock for ESPP purchases of $0.2 million offset by $0.1 million for payment of employment taxes related to stock option exercises. Financing activities provided $43.8 million of cash in 2014, including of $34.2 million net proceeds from our IPO, $9.1 million from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock at $7.00 per share in a private placement, and $0.5 million from stock option and warrant exercises\nFinancing activities provided $43.8 million of cash in 2014, including of $34.2 million net proceeds from our IPO, $9.1 million from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock at $7.00 per share in a private placement, and $0.5 million from stock option and warrant exercises. Financing activities provided $21.9 million of cash in 2013, including $19.5 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes primarily to existing investors and $2.4 million from the issuance of 0.3 million shares of common stock to new investors at $7.00 per share to new investors and $0.1 million from stock option exercises, offset by a convertible note repayment of $0.1 million.\nFinancial Commitments\nEffective August 2012, we entered into a lease agreement (the Sylmar Lease\u201d) with a Company owned by the major stockholder of the Company for office space for a term of five years that was to expire on February 28, 2017. The Sylmar Lease included rental of additional space commencing January 1, 2013 and a five year option to renew. The lease requires us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance each year, and is subject to periodic cost of living adjustments. In April 2014, the Sylmar Lease was renegotiated with the term ending on February 28, 2022, and a five year option to renew. The new lease also requires us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance each year and includes automatic increases in base rent each year. In November 2014, the industrial center in which Company's premises are located was sold to an independent third party.\nOur Swiss subsidiary rents office space in Switzerland on a month-to-month basis for CHF 8,200 (approximately $8,200) per month.\nFuture minimum rental payments required under the operating leases are as follows for the years ended December 31 (in thousands).\nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>808 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>910 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,095 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.", "item_7_truncated": " \u00b7 In 2013, we received marketing approval in the United States (FDA) for the Argus II System. \nTable 208: <table> <tr> <td>Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>808 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>833 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>884 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>910 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,095 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to offering these discounts, our business was negatively impacted during the first two months of 2016 by the difference between our selling price and the 2016 payment rate for Medicare patients. More specifically, we believe several Medicare cases and one planned implanting center opening were delayed due to reimbursement concerns. Given these reimbursement concerns in the U.S. and the inherent variability in our results, we now expect our Q1 2016 implants will be in a range of between 10 and 14 implants worldwide. This expected range is down from the 19 worldwide implants reported in the first quarter of 2015. Most of this expected shortfall is attributable to the US market. With U.S. discounts in place, we should see implant levels rebound in upcoming quarters as we open new centers, qualify more patients and benefit from expanded reimbursement coverage.\nProduct and Clinical Development Plans\n \u00b7 In 2011, we received marketing approval in Europe (CE Mark) for the Argus II System. \nGoing Concern\nNet loss.\u2003The net loss was $23.0 million in 2013, as compared to $35.2 million in 2014.\n \u00b7 In 2006, we commenced clinical trials for the Argus II System, which later became our first commercial product. \nOperating Expenses.\u2003We generally recognize our operating expenses as we incur them in four general operational categories: research and development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating expenses also include a non-cash component related to the amortization of deferred stock-based compensation allocated to research and development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing and general and administrative personnel. From time to time we have received grants from institutions or agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, to help fund the some of the cost of our development efforts. We have recorded these grants as offsets to the costs as they are incurred to complete the related work.\nAmortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes decreased from $5.1 million in 2014 to $0 in 2015. This decrease is due to the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, when all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company did not incur the amortization of issuance discount on the convertible promissory notes\nOur first commercial product, the Argus II System, is a retinal prosthesis that can provide some functional vision to individuals blinded by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The Argus II System is an implantable neurostimulation device that uses electrical stimulation of the retina (based on a wireless video camera feed) to replace the function of the defunct photo-receptors in RP patients.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWorking capital was $18.8 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $33.5 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $14.7 million or 44.0%. Working capital was $33.5 million at December 31, 2014, as compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2013, an increase of $24.4 million or 268%. We use our cash, money market funds and working capital to fund our operating activities.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \u2022 The Argus II System \n \nThe formula to determine the number of IPO Supplemental Shares to be issued on a trigger of the Long Term Investor Right will be: (i) $18.00 minus (ii) the average of the highest consecutive closing prices in any 90 day trading period on the principal exchange during the two years after the Closing Date (the Measurement Average\u201d) divided by the Measurement Average. Fractional shares issuable to a qualifying IPO Shareholder resulting from the calculation will be rounded up to the next whole share of common stock, taking into account the aggregate number of Long Term Investor Rights of a holder. As an illustrative example, if the highest average of consecutive closing prices over any 90 calendar day period is $10.00 per share, each Long-Term Investor Right will be entitled to 0.80 additional shares of common stock, which is calculated as: ($18.00 - $10.00)/$10.00.\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectability is probable, and delivery has occurred.\nThe IPO offering price for purposes of the calculation of the amount of common stock to be issued on a Long Term Investor Right will be subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization, recapitalization or split-up of the Company's shares, the issuance of a stock dividend or any similar event. The amount of IPO Supplemental Shares, if any, to be issued will be computed by an independent public accountant as soon as practicable following the second anniversary of the Closing Date. The determination by such independent public accountant will be final and binding on the Company and on all qualifying IPO Shareholders and the Company will within about 15 days after receipt of written determination deliver to shareholders certificates evidencing the additional shares.\n \nOur Swiss subsidiary rents office space in Switzerland on a month-to-month basis for CHF 8,200 (approximately $8,200) per month.\nOur financial statements have been presented on the basis that our business is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with one product line and limited commercial product revenues, including limitations on our operating capital resources and uncertain demand for our products. We have incurred recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our 2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales decreased from $5.6 million in 2013 to $3.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 36%. This decrease is primarily due to increasing our production volume and yields in 2014 relative to 2013, resulting in more finished goods and sub-assemblies being accepted into inventory and a lower level of scrapped product being expenses. As we manufacture more products, our manufacturing overhead is spread over more units and our cost per unit produced decreases. Also, as our yields improve and we accept more units into inventory, the amount of scrapped product that is written off to cost of sales decreases. We will continue to invest in improving our manufacturing processes, and we expect that manufacturing yields will improve and cost of sales will decrease relative to our revenues over the next few years, although we expect significant fluctuations on a quarter to quarter basis.\nNet sales.\u2003Our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of our Argus II System. We began selling our products in Europe in 2011, Saudi Arabia in 2012, in the United States and Canada in 2014, and in Turkey in 2015. Our objective is to increase our product revenue over the next several years as we pursue commercialization of our product, as our product becomes more well-known and accepted in the market, and as insurance coverage becomes more widespread.\nWe have received verbal assurances from two shareholders, one of whom is currently a director of the Company, and the other of whom is an affiliate of an early investor in the Company, that they will each exercise their subscription rights in full. In addition, to the extent that other shareholders do not exercise their subscription rights in full, these two shareholders have also provided verbal assurances to us that they will exercise their respective over-subscription privileges at the subscription price, to allow these shareholders to make an aggregate investment in us of up to $12.75 million. Accordingly, the rights offering is expected to raise a minimum of $12.75 million and a maximum of approximately $19.8 million in gross proceeds. We expect that the rights offering may close during the second quarter of 2016. The director/shareholder has also been granted the right, but not the obligation, to provide all of the remaining unsubscribed amounts, up to the aggregate balance of the amount not taken up in the rights offering by our other shareholders. We believe that these two shareholders have the financial capability to meet these financial commitments to us as described herein.\n \u2022 Hospital start up kits (one per site), \nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and\nThe Company also sells surgical supplies to customers and recognizes revenue on these products when they are shipped and other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nPatent Costs.\u2003The Company has over 345 domestic and foreign patents. Due to the uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on Company's research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal, filing fees and other costs, including internally generated costs, are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company will issue IPO Supplemental Shares to IPO Shareholders who have not otherwise forfeited their Long Term Investor Right if, during the two-year period immediately following the IPO closing date, the Company's common stock does not trade at or above $18.00 per share (200% of the IPO price per share) for any five consecutive day period. If the Company's common stock trades on its principal exchange at 200% of the IPO price per share or greater on five consecutive trading days during the two years after the IPO closing date, the Long Term Investor Right will terminate.\nFinancing activities provided $2.8 million of cash in 2015, including $2.7 million from stock option and warrant exercises, issuance of common stock for ESPP purchases of $0.2 million offset by $0.1 million for payment of employment taxes related to stock option exercises. Financing activities provided $43.8 million of cash in 2014, including of $34.2 million net proceeds from our IPO, $9.1 million from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock at $7.00 per share in a private placement, and $0.5 million from stock option and warrant exercises\nFuture minimum rental payments required under the operating leases are as follows for the years ended December 31 (in thousands).\n \nWe are currently working on new external hardware and software for our Argus II System, which we believe may improve the performance characteristics, ease of use and resolution of the system. In the first half of 2016, we plan to introduce new clinical software to be used for adjusting the Argus II that we believe will help clinicians with the initial programming and follow up training of patients. In early 2017, we plan to introduce new eyewear and a new VPU that will allow us to implement some software enhancements that may improve the performance of the Argus II System. For example, improving the resolution of the system may enhance the user experience and increase our potential market size. Improved image resolution may be achieved by enhanced image processing, including contrast enhancement and electronic zooming.\nThe amount of revenue recognized per implant in a period depends on several factors, including reimbursement policies set by private and government payers, the mix of implants between EMEA and North America, exchange rates, payment terms that may affect revenue recognition, and sales of ancillary products, such as clinical start-up kits and surgical supplies. Given the recent CMS pricing decision discussed above, we made the determination in late February 2016 to temporarily discount the Argus device in the US to approximately $92,000 compared to the $144,000 we sold the product for in 2015. Accordingly, we expect that our average revenue per implant will be lower in 2016 than it was in 2015. The actual impact of this pricing decision on our average revenue will depend on the number of US patients implanted with the Argus II in a given period. Beyond 2016, our average revenue per implant may increase if we are successful in negotiating with CMS to increase the Medicare FFS reimbursement rate for the Argus II System. No assurance can be given, however, that we will be successful in doing so.\n \u2022 Training, and \n \nConvertible Promissory Notes and Warrants.\u2003The warrants and embedded beneficial conversion feature of convertible promissory notes are classified as equity under FASB ASC Topic 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity\u201d. The Company allocates the proceeds of the convertible promissory notes between convertible promissory notes and the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes based on their relative fair values at the commitment date. The fair value of the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the respective allocated proceeds to the warrants is recorded in additional paid-in capital. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the same valuation assumptions as described herein for Stock Based Compensation. The embedded beneficial conversion feature associated with convertible promissory notes is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20 Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options.\u201d The portion of debt discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is being amortized over the life of the convertible promissory notes. For the portion of debt discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the beneficial conversion feature, it is amortized over the term of the notes from the respective dates of issuance.\n \u00b7 A $4.1 million grant under Joint Research and Development Agreement with The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in 2014, \nResearch and development expense.\u2003Research and development expense decreased from $5.0 million in 2014 to $3.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 40%. The decrease is primarily attributable to utilizing $1.9 million of grant funding from The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to offset labor, consulting and overhead costs incurred during 2015 compared to no grant funding in the prior year. To date, we have recognized $1.9 million out of a total $4.1 million related to this grant. We expect research and development costs to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future cortical implant product.\nFinancing activities provided $43.8 million of cash in 2014, including of $34.2 million net proceeds from our IPO, $9.1 million from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock at $7.00 per share in a private placement, and $0.5 million from stock option and warrant exercises. Financing activities provided $21.9 million of cash in 2013, including $19.5 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes primarily to existing investors and $2.4 million from the issuance of 0.3 million shares of common stock to new investors at $7.00 per share to new investors and $0.1 million from stock option exercises, offset by a convertible note repayment of $0.1 million.\n \u00b7 Issuance of convertible debt with the face value of $19.5 million in 2013, \n \u00b7 Revenue of $8.9 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, generated by sales of our Argus II System, \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02), Consolidation (Topic 810). ASU 2015-02 changes the guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation mode. ASU 2015-02 affects the following areas: (1) limited partnerships and similar legal entities; (2) evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest; (3) the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination; (4) the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination; and (5) certain investment funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the guidance in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 regarding leases. The new standard requires lessee recognition on the balance sheet of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. It further requires recognition in the income statement of a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis. Finally, it requires classification of all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. It is effective for fiscal years commencing after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. Management has not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nInsurance Reimbursement\nSelling and marketing expense.\u2003Selling and marketing expense increased from $3.3 million in 2013 to $6.8 million in 2014, an increase of $3.5 million, or 106%. This increase in costs is attributable to an increase in personnel, as well as higher costs for marketing and customer awareness programs, as we increased our efforts to commercialize the Argus II System as, beginning in 2014, we began selling our product in the United States, Canada and Spain. While we expect these costs to increase in the future as we increase our selling and marketing resources to accelerate the commercialization of our product, we expect selling and marketing expense to decrease over time when expressed as a percentage of product revenue.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCurrently, our Argus II System is approved for persons suffering from RP. We believe we may be able to expand the market for the Argus II System beyond RP to patients with severe to profound vision loss due to dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. We are currently enrolling and implanting patients in a pilot study, of about five patients, to evaluate the safety and benefit of the Argus II System for use in persons suffering from AMD. Based on the results from this study, we could begin a larger scale efficacy trial. The size and timing of the pivotal study are dependent on multiple factors including the actual subset of AMD patients we target and whether we decide to modify the Argus II system prior to commencing a pivotal study. The subset of patients will influence the regulatory and reimbursement pathways, the size of the study and the length of time required to enroll the study. The company is also evaluating the potential benefits of system changes optimized for AMD. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in any of these endeavors. If the Argus II System is successfully developed and approved for sale to treat AMD, as to which there can be no assurances, we believe that the potential addressable market opportunity for that device will significantly exceed our existing RP markets for the Argus II System.\nAmortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes increased from $3.4 million in 2013 to $5.1 million in 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 50%. This increase is due to the higher average level of debt outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013, although the debt was only outstanding for ten and one-half months in 2014, and to higher value attributed to the beneficial conversion feature associated with promissory notes issued during 2013, but which was only outstanding for a part of 2013. As a result of the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company will no longer incur the amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\n \u00b7 Expected dividend yield is based on current yield at the grant date or the average dividend yield over the historical period. The Company has never declared or paid dividends and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. \nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. See Note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of our significant accounting policies.\nGeneral and administrative expense.\u2003General and administrative expense increased from $4.2 million in 2013 to $6.6 million in 2014, an increase of $2.4 million or 57%. This increase is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of higher stock-based compensation charges in 2014, $0.8 million in higher compensation costs, which includes $0.4 million due to forgiveness of a loan receivable to an officer to finance stock options, $0.2 million of expense related to a stock award to the Company's Chairman, as well as higher spending on patent and audit related fees. The stock-based compensation charge in 2014 includes $0.6 million related to option grants to our chief executive officer. After we become a public company, we expect our general and administrative costs to increase as we incur the additional costs of being a public company, including higher legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing, and other costs.\nIn the United States, the amount of sales revenue recognized per unit has been limited in some situations due to the uncertainties of the reimbursement environment and payment terms. Favorable claims outcomes and the development of positive coverage policies in the United States may eventually result in greater and earlier revenue recognition.\nIn the United States, the amount of revenue recognized per unit has been limited in some situations due to the uncertainties of the reimbursement environment and payment terms. In such cases, revenue is not recognized until the consideration becomes fixed, generally when paid to the Company.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. Based on the FASB's Exposure Draft Update issued on April 29, 2015, and approved in July 2015, Revenue from Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2014-09 is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating ASU 2014-9, and has not yet determined its impact to the Company's financial statements, nor decided the transition approach it will take.\nIn 2015, 32 individuals in the US and Canada received and were implanted with the Argus II technology. Of these, nine were Medicare FFS patients, 13 were Medicare Advantage patients and three were commercially insured patients. The remaining seven patients were covered by private pay, Veteran's Administration, or other insurers.\nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales increased from $3.6 million in 2014 to $5.3 million in 2015, an increase of $1.7 million or 47%. This increase is primarily due to increasing our production volume and yields in 2015 relative to 2014, resulting in more finished goods and sub-assemblies being accepted into inventory and a lower level of scrapped product being expensed. As we manufacture more products, our manufacturing overhead is spread over more units and our cost per unit produced decreases. Also, as our yields improve and we accept more units into inventory, the amount of scrapped product that is written off to cost of sales decreases. We will continue to invest in improving our manufacturing processes. However, if we produce fewer units in 2016, our cost per unit produced could increase. Additionally, our lower expected revenue per implant in 2016, as discussed above, will most likely lead to lower gross margins being recognized in 2016 than in 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expense.\u2003General and administrative expense increased from $6.6 million in 2014 to $8.2 million in 2015, an increase of $1.6 million, or 24%. This increase is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of higher stock-based compensation charges in 2015, $0.5 million in higher compensation costs, as well as higher legal, accounting, insurance and regulatory costs associated with being a public company.\nDuring 2015, we used $20.6 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $20.0 million, offset by non-cash charges of $3.3 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million. This compares to 2014, when we used $17.1 million of cash in operating activities, consisting of a net loss of $35.2 million, offset by a non-cash charge of $6.9 million for the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the automatic conversion of convertible debt triggered by our IPO, reduced by non-cash charges of $9.6 million for amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, a stock grant to a related party, common stock issued for services, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million.\n \u00b7 Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and consulting costs related to the design, development, and enhancements of our current and potential future products, offset by grant revenue received in support of specific research projects. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future products, such as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis. We also expect to receive additional grants in the future that will be offset primarily against research and development costs. \nThe Right is an equity instrument that is accounted for as a component of the actual price per common share paid by the investor in the IPO. For basic earnings per share, the common shares associated with the Right are treated as contingently issuable shares and will not be included in basic earnings per share until the actual number of shares can be calculated and the shares have been issued.\n \u00b7 In 2015, we commenced a clinical trial in the UK for an expanded indication for the Argus II System in individuals with dry AMD. \n \u00b7 The risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. \nAmortization of discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003As discussed more fully above, our convertible promissory notes issued during 2012 and 2013 were issued with detachable warrants and an embedded beneficial conversion feature, which were recorded as an issuance discount with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. This issuance discount was amortized as a non-cash charge over the term of the convertible promissory note. The terms of the convertible promissory notes provided for conversion into equity on an IPO, at $5.00 per share. At December 31, 2013, the unamortized issuance cost related to our convertible promissory notes was $12.0 million. As a result of our IPO in November 2014, $7.0 million of unamortized issuance costs were charged to income due to the automatic conversion of all outstanding convertible promissory notes into common stock.\nA significant focus for 2016, and beyond, will be expanding US reimbursement coverage and working with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish Medicare hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center payment rates that are in line with facility costs. We have individuals working at Second Sight dedicated to reimbursement and employ a variety of consultants with expertise in this field. Currently, five MACs that oversee 17 states and two US Territories have agreed to cover the Argus II System when medically necessary for the FDA approved indications. The MACs now covering the Argus II include First Coast Service Options (covers on a case-by-case basis for Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands), CGS Administrators, LLC (for the states of Ohio and Kentucky), Palmetto GBA (for the states of North and South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia, other than the counties of Arlington and Fairfax in Virginia and the City of Arlington in Virginia), National Government Services, Inc. (NGS), Jurisdiction 6 (for the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), and NGS, Jurisdiction K (for the states of Connecticut, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont). We are actively engaged with the remaining MACs and are committed to providing them with clinical evidence to support our requests for coverage. We expect that additional positive coverage decisions will be issued over time but cannot predict timing or ultimate success with each MAC.\n \u00b7 Clinical and regulatory expenses consist primarily of salaries, travel and related expenses for personnel engaged in clinical and regulatory functions, as well as internal and external costs associated with conducting clinical trials and maintaining relationships with regulatory agencies. We expect clinical and regulatory expenses to increase as we assess the safety and efficacy of enhancements to our current Argus II System, seek to expand the indications for the Argus II System, such as AMD, and prepare to initiate clinical studies of potential future products, such as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis. \nWe began selling the Argus II System in Europe at the end of 2011, in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and in the United States and Canada in 2014, and in Turkey in 2015. We have limited regulatory approval in Canada and Saudi Arabia, and we are currently applying for full approval. To date, all of our sales have been made by our direct sales force, but we plan to add partners and distributors to enhance our coverage of existing and future markets. In 2014, we entered into our first distribution agreements, that cover the countries of Spain and Turkey, and we are at various stages of negotiations with a number of other distributors for countries in Europe and the Middle East.\n \u00b7 Issuance of common stock in a private placements aggregating $9.1 million and $2.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and \nOur company's consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and have financed our working capital requirements through the recurring sale of our equity securities in both public and private offerings. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its current report on our 2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern (see Going Concern\u201d above\u201d).\n \u00b7 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive, legal, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting and professional fees, patent filing costs, insurance costs and other general corporate expenses, including rent. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operate as a public company. \n \n \u00b7 The grant price of the issuances, with certain exceptions, is determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the date of grant. \n \u00b7 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, travel and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing and business development functions, as well as costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we hire additional sales personnel, initiate additional marketing programs, develop relationships with new distributors, and expand the number of doctors and medical centers that buy and implant our Argus II System and any future products. \nInterest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense on the convertible promissory notes decreased from $2.0 million in 2014 to $0 in 2015. This decrease is due to the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, when all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company did not incur interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nInterest expense on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense was a non-cash expense associated with the Company's convertible promissory notes. Simple interest was accrued at 7.5% per annum based on the face value of the convertible promissory notes outstanding during the year. The accrued interest was added to the amount of outstanding debt, but does not earn additional interest. The terms of the convertible promissory notes provided for automatic conversion of principal and accrued interest into equity on our IPO, at $5.00 per share. Accordingly, subsequent to our IPO in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company no longer incurred interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nBusiness Overview\n \nWe are actively engaged with CMS concerning the outpatient payment rate for Medicare FFS patients. As discussed above, the 2016 Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate for the Argus procedure is $95,000. Based on available cost information, the Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate should be at least $150,000 to fully cover the hospitals' costs for the device and procedure (with physician fees being billed and reimbursed separately). Our efforts have been focused on changing the 2016 payment rate to be more reflective of hospitals' actual costs. As of March 1, 2016, we are operating our business with the belief that the US outpatient payment rate will remain $95,000 in 2016. In parallel, the company is focused on obtaining a 2017 outpatient payment rate that adequately covers hospital costs. Several paths exist to accomplishing this goal including continued education of hospitals concerning the importance of properly coding, billing and submitting Argus II Medicare claims. This activity is important to establish an accurate claims data base that CMS will use to set future payment rates. Finally, the company is exploring other options for changes to Medicare payment policy that may facilitate appropriate reimbursement. No assurance can be given that the company will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nObtaining reimbursement from governmental and private insurance companies is critical to our future commercial success. Due to the cost of the Argus II System, our sales would be limited without the availability of third party reimbursement. In the US, coding, coverage, and payment are necessary for the surgical procedure and Argus II system to be reimbursed by payers. Coding has been established for the device and the surgical procedure. Coverage and payment vary by payer. Argus II patients are eligible for Medicare, and coverage is primarily provided through traditional Medicare (sometimes referred to as Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS)) or Medicare Advantage. A small percentage of patients are covered by commercial insurers.\nOn January 25, 2016, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct a registered rights offering as of a future record date to allow the holders of our common stock to purchase newly-issued shares of common stock. The shares will be offered at the lower of $4.25 per share or 85% of the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the last day of the offering period. Assuming full subscription and a closing stock price of between $4.00 and $6.00 per share on the last day of the offering period, we expect to sell between 4.6 million and 5.8 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $19.8 million. The actual number of shares sold and proceeds raised will depend on, among other factors, the extent to which current shareholders participate in the rights offering and the final price per share at which we sell our common stock. We intend to use the proceeds from this rights offering to invest in our business to expand sales and marketing efforts, enhance current products, gain regulatory approvals for additional indications, and continue research and development into next generation technology.\nNet loss.\u2003The net loss was $35.2 million in 2014, as compared to $20.0 million in 2015. The $15.2 million reduction in net loss from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to approximately $14.1 million of non-cash charges related to convertible debt and the conversion of convertible debt into common stock as a result of the Company's IPO in November 2014. These expenses include approximately $2.0 million in non-cash interest expense, $5.1 million for the amortization of debt issuance discounts, and $7.0 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance discounts.\n \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nResults of Operations\nWithin Europe, we have obtained reimbursement approval in Germany, France and two regions of Italy. We also are seeking reimbursement approval in other countries including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey. In France, Second Sight was selected to receive the first \"Forfait Innovation\" (Innovation Bundle) from the Ministry of Health, which is a special funding program for breakthrough procedures to be introduced into clinical practice. As part of this program, Second Sight is conducting a post-market study in France which will enroll a total of 18 subjects and follow them for two years. The French program will fund implantation of up to 18 additional patients that will not be part of the post-market study. After review of the study's results, we expect Argus II therapy to be covered and funded through the standard payment system in France, however, we can provide no assurance that the French government will continue to fund the Argus II after the first 36 implants.\n \nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales includes the salaries, benefits, material, overhead, third party costs, warranty, charges for excess and obsolete inventory, and other costs required to make our Argus II System at our Sylmar, California facility. Historically, our cost of sales has been greater than our revenues, which has resulted in gross losses. However, in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 and for all of fiscal 2015, due to higher revenues and increased manufacturing output and efficiencies, we generated a positive gross margin. Our product involves new and technologically complex materials and processes. As we move from making small quantities of our product for clinical trials to larger quantities for commercial distribution, we are developing new manufacturing techniques and processes that we expect to allow us to scale production. We are currently experiencing low yields on our manufacturing process, but we expect that over the next few years we will be able to refine our processes and improve our manufacturing yields. Accordingly, as we produce in quantities sufficient to support our commercial efforts, we expect that we will generate a positive gross profit.\nOn November 18, 2014, we sold 4,025,000 shares of common stock in an IPO, including 525,000 shares sold upon exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option, at a price of $9.00 per share. Our net proceeds totaled $34.2 million after cash offering costs of $2.0 million, and excluding non-cash costs of $2.9 million for the fair value of warrants and common stock issued in connections with services rendered.\nRevenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple deliverables (multiple-element arrangements), comprising the following deliverables:\nInvesting activities in 2015 provided $17.5 million of cash, reflecting $18.3 million in proceeds from money market investments offset by $0.8 million for the purchase of equipment.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWrite-off of unamortized discount on conversion of convertible promissory notes.\u2003The original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes specified that the notes automatically converted into common stock of the Company in the event, among other things, of an IPO. Accordingly, as of the IPO date, the Company wrote off $7.0 million of deferred issuance costs related to the convertible promissory notes that converted into common stock.\nSelling and marketing expense.\u2003Selling and marketing expense increased from $6.8 million in 2014 to $8.9 million in 2015, an increase of $2.1 million or 31%. This increase in costs is attributable to an increase in personnel, as well as higher costs for marketing and customer awareness programs, as we increased our efforts to commercialize the Argus II System. Beginning in 2014, we began selling our product in the United States, Canada and Spain. These costs increased as we intensified our selling and marketing efforts to accelerate the commercialization of our product, but we expect selling and marketing expense to decrease over time when expressed as a percentage of product revenue.\nThe Company has identified and will track IPO Investors who have perfected their Rights on a quarterly basis. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will disclose the potential dilutive effect of the Right, including the number of common shares that would be issuable on such date, based on the actual share price movements since the IPO.\nThe Company sells through distributors in certain countries. The Company provides these distributors with clinical start-up kits, surgical supplies and the Argus II System, as well as training them to provide pre- and post-surgical support. The Company monitors the surgery. Other than surgical support which is provided by the Company, the distributor is responsible for delivering products and services to its customers. In the past, the Company has allowed distributors to return or exchange products in certain situations. Due to the Company's continuing involvement and its returns policy, the Company recognizes revenue from distributors when the implantation procedure has been performed by the distributor's customer, and all other revenue recognition criteria between the Company and the distributor have been met.\n \u00b7 Medicare FFS patients - Coverage is determined by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) that administer various geographic regions of the US. As of March 1, 2016, five of 12 MACs (17 states, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands) have made positive coverage decisions for the Argus II. Effective January 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established a New Technology Ambulatory Payment Class (APC) 1599, Level 48, with a payment rate of $95,000 for both the procedure and the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. From October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, the Argus II was classified as having pass-through payment status and the device was paid separately from the procedure. \nNet Sales.\u2003Our net sales increased from $1.6 million in 2013 to $3.4 million in 2014, an increase of $1.8 million or 113%. This increase in product revenue was due to selling more implants in 2014 and attaining a higher average selling price for implanted devices. We sold 29 Argus II Systems that were implanted in 2014, compared to 22 in the prior year. In 2013, all implants were in Europe and the Middle East, whereas in 2014, there were 16 implants in the United States and Canada and 13 in Europe and the Middle East. The decrease in implants in Europe and the Middle East during 2014, as compared to 2013, is primarily due to sites in Italy and Saudi Arabia, which together accounted for 10 implants in 2013, performing no implants in the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, before resuming activity with a combined 4 implants in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in average selling price in 2014 was primarily due to establishing a higher selling price on the introduction of the Argus II system in the United States and Canada, combined with a lower level of discounting and free goods in Europe in comparison to 2013.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n \u00b7 As permitted by SAB 107, due to the Company's insufficient history of option activity, management utilizes the simplified approach to estimate the options expected term, which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. \nIn accordance with the original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes, the notes converted into the Company's common stock upon the Company's IPO. In November 2014, convertible promissory notes with a face value of $29.5 million, plus accrued interest of $3.7 million, converted into 6.6 million shares of common stock.\n \u00b7 Commercially insured patients - Commercial insurance plans make coverage and payment rate decisions independent of Medicare decisions and contracts are individually negotiated with facility and physician providers. \nTo date, we have not faced traditional sales challenges in any of our markets, largely due to the currently unmet clinical need and the lack of any other available device or competitive treatment for RP-caused profound blindness. Our marketing activities have focused on raising awareness of the Argus II System with potential patients, implanting physicians, and referring physicians. Our marketing activities include exhibiting, sponsoring symposia, and securing podium presence at professional and trade shows, securing journalist coverage in popular and trade media, attending patient meetings focused on educating patients about existing and future treatments, and sponsoring information sessions for the Argus II System. In the US, our efforts in 2016 will focus on presenting media ads dedicated to RP patients and their families. These ads will be placed in geographic areas where we have proven implanting centers and established reimbursement. Based on pilot efforts we conducted in 2015 we believe this may be a cost-efficient method to connect qualified patients with Argus II implanting centers. As of March 1, 2016 as a result of these efforts the Company had a patient interest list with over 150 conditionally qualified individuals.\nEffective August 2012, we entered into a lease agreement (the Sylmar Lease\u201d) with a Company owned by the major stockholder of the Company for office space for a term of five years that was to expire on February 28, 2017. The Sylmar Lease included rental of additional space commencing January 1, 2013 and a five year option to renew. The lease requires us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance each year, and is subject to periodic cost of living adjustments. In April 2014, the Sylmar Lease was renegotiated with the term ending on February 28, 2022, and a five year option to renew. The new lease also requires us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance each year and includes automatic increases in base rent each year. In November 2014, the industrial center in which Company's premises are located was sold to an independent third party.\nRevenue Recognition.\u2003The Company's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of its Argus II retinal implant, which is implanted during retinal surgery to restore some functional vision to patients blinded by Retinitis Pigmentosa. The Company sells to a variety of customers including university hospitals, large medical centers and distributors.\n \u00b7 Medicare Advantage patients - Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same benefits as those covered by the MAC in that jurisdiction. For example, if a MAC in a jurisdiction has favorable coverage for the Argus II, then all Medicare Advantage plans in that MAC jurisdiction are required to offer the same coverage for the Argus II. Individual hospitals and ASCs may negotiate Medicare Advantage contracts specific to that individual facility, which may include additional separate payment for the Argus II implant system. In addition, procedural payment is variable and can be based on a percentage of billed charges, payment groupings or other individually negotiated payment methodologies. Medicare Advantage plans also allow providers to confirm coverage and payment for the Argus II procedure in advance of implantation. In 2015, 93% or 13 of 14 Medicare Advantage pre-authorization requests were granted. \nIn order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured, the Company assesses a number of factors, including creditworthiness of the customer and medical insurance coverage. The Company may periodically grant extended payment terms to customers. In such situations, the Company defers the recognition of revenue until collection becomes probable, which is generally upon receipt of payment.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u00b7 In 2002, we commenced clinical trials for our prototype product, the Argus I retinal prosthesis. \nFrom inception, our operations have been funded primarily through the sales of our common stock, as well as from the issuance of convertible debt, research and clinical grants, and product revenue generated by the sale of our Argus II System. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we funded our business primarily through:\nInterest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense on the convertible promissory notes increased from $1.6 million in 2013 to $2.0 million in 2014, an increase of $0.4 million, or 25%. This increase is due to the higher average level of debt outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013, although the debt was only outstanding for ten and one-half months in 2014. As a result of the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company no longer incurred interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nWrite-off of unamortized discount on conversion of convertible promissory notes.\u2003The original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes specified that the notes automatically converted into common stock of the Company in the event, among other things, of an IPO. Accordingly, as of the IPO date, the Company wrote off $7.0 million of deferred issuance costs related to the convertible promissory notes that converted into common stock.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management's evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. The consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K and in conjunction with the Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nLong Term Investor Right.\u2003Each beneficial owner ( IPO Shareholder\u201d) of the Company's common stock, who purchased shares directly in the offering ( IPO Shares\u201d), may qualify to receive up to one additional share of common stock from the Company for each share purchased in the offering ( IPO Supplemental Shares\u201d) pursuant to the Long Term Investor Right that was included with each IPO Share. To qualify for receipt of IPO Supplemental Shares, an IPO Shareholder was required to take action to become the direct registered owner of its IPO Shares within 90 days following the closing date of the offering, or by February 22, 2015. Furthermore, IPO Shareholders are required to hold their IPO Shares in their own name and not place them in street name\u201d or trade them at any time during the 24 month period immediately following the IPO closing date. This Long Term Investors Right is non-detachable and transferable only in limited circumstances.\n \u00b7 In 2007, we commenced clinical trials in the US for the Argus II System, which later became our first commercial product. \nClinical and regulatory expense.\u2003Clinical and regulatory expense decreased from $3.2 million in 2013 to $2.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 19%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of staffing in 2014 compared to 2013. We expect clinical and regulatory costs to increase in the future as we conduct clinical trials to assess possible enhancements to our existing product, and to assess the safety and efficacy of our current product for treating blindness due to age related macular degeneration.\nNo assurances can be given that we will ultimately be successful in completing this rights offering, or if unsuccessful, that we will be able to raise sufficient funds through other means so as to be able to continue operating our business at current levels beyond the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nResearch and development expense.\u2003Research and development expense increased from $3.2 million in 2013 to $5.0 million in 2014, an increase of $1.8 million, or 56%. This increase in expense is primarily related to work developing our next generation externals, which includes new eyewear and a new video processing unit. In 2014, we spent $0.9 million more on salaries and other compensation costs than in 2013, and we spent $0.3 million more on materials, consulting services and other supplies to make and evaluate prototypes. We expect research and development costs to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future cortical implant product.\n \n \nDuring 2014, we used $17.1 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $35.2 million, offset by non-cash charges of $6.9 million for the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the automatic conversion of convertible debt triggered by our IPO, $9.6 million for amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, a stock grant to a related party, common stock issued for services, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. This compares to 2013, when we used $17.4 million of cash in operating activities, consisting of a net loss of $23.0 million, reduced by non-cash charges of $6.1 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, and non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, and increased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million.\nWe are also conducting preclinical development, including animal studies, of a product for cortical stimulation that we refer to as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis (or Orion I\u201d), which we expect will be able to provide some vision restoration to individuals with almost all unpreventable forms of blindness. Our objective in designing and developing the Orion I is to bypass the retina and optic nerve and to directly stimulate the visual cortex region of the brain. Human clinical testing is likely to take the form of a feasibility study followed by a premarket approval pivotal trial. The details of these trials will be determined collaboratively with the FDA at that time. We cannot accurately estimate the timing or exact cost of these trials at this time. If the Orion I is successfully developed and approved for sale, as to which there can be no assurances, we believe that the potential addressable market opportunity for that device will greatly exceed our existing RP markets for the Argus II System.\nStock-Based Compensation.\u2003Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 718 Share-Based Payment ( ASC 718\u201d), the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards. Under ASC 718, the Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and\n \u2022 Surgical support, \nThe deliverables may vary by transaction.\nClinical and regulatory expense.\u2003Clinical and regulatory expense increased from $2.6 million in 2014 to $3.5 million in 2015, an increase of $0.9 million, or 35%. This increase is primarily attributable to the cost of post-market and other clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of our current product, to assess possible enhancements to our existing product, and to assess the efficacy of our technology for treating blindness due to Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-01 (ASU 2015-01), Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20). ASU 2015-01 eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. Presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item. Paragraph 225-20-45-2 contains the following criteria that must both be met for extraordinary classification: (1) Unusual nature. The underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the entity, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates. (2) Infrequency of occurrence. The underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates. If an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the guidance prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \u00b7 In 1998, we were founded. \nNet Sales.\u2003Our net sales increased from $3.4 million in 2014 to $8.9 million in 2015, an increase of $5.5 million, or 162%. This increase in net sales was primarily due to selling 75 Argus II systems that were implanted in 2015 compared to 29 in 2014. Average revenue recognized per implant was fairly constant at approximately $119,000 in 2015 compared to $117,000 in 2014. In 2015, there were 43 implants in Europe and the Middle East (EMEA) compared to 13 implants in the prior year. The increase in implants in EMEA is primarily attributable to reimbursement programs in France and Italy, which combined accounted for 31 implants in 2015 compared to three in the 2014. In the United States and Canada (North America), implants increased to 32 in 2015 compared to 16 in 2014. We began selling the Argus II in North America in 2014, and the growth in 2015 represents the positive results of our ongoing commercial efforts.\nInvesting activities in 2014 used $25.9 million of cash, reflecting $25.4 million in purchases of money market investments and $0.5 million for the purchase of equipment.\n \u00b7 In 2014, we completed our initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol EYES.\u201d \nOur major corporate, clinical and regulatory milestones include:\nWe were founded in 1998 with a mission to develop, manufacture, and market prosthetic devices that restore vision to the blind. Our principal offices are located in Sylmar, California, approximately 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. We also have an office in Lausanne, Switzerland that manages our commercial and clinical operations in Europe and the Middle East.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n \nIn November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17 (ASU 2015-17), Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have any impact on Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \nThe Company evaluates each deliverable in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within the Company's control. The Company has determined that the elements listed above do not have standalone value to the customer until delivery of all components has occurred. Accordingly, revenue from multiple-element arrangements is recognized when delivery of all of deliverables has taken place and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Generally, revenue recognition occurs at the time of implantation, but revenue recognition can be delayed if certain training has not been delivered to the implanting sites, or if other revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\n \u00b7 Issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in November 2014, which generated net proceeds of $34.2 million of cash after offering expenses. \nFinancial Commitments\nInvesting activities in 2013 used $4.5 million of cash, reflecting $4.3 million in purchases of money market investments and $0.2 million used to purchase property and equipment in 2013.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 (ASU 2015-03), Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the new guidance. ASU 2015-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. An entity is required to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented is adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (i.e., debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). The adoption of ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \u00b7 Volatility is determined based on average historical volatilities of comparable companies in similar industry. ", "item_7_text": " \u00b7 In 2013, we received marketing approval in the United States (FDA) for the Argus II System. \nPrior to offering these discounts, our business was negatively impacted during the first two months of 2016 by the difference between our selling price and the 2016 payment rate for Medicare patients. More specifically, we believe several Medicare cases and one planned implanting center opening were delayed due to reimbursement concerns. Given these reimbursement concerns in the U.S. and the inherent variability in our results, we now expect our Q1 2016 implants will be in a range of between 10 and 14 implants worldwide. This expected range is down from the 19 worldwide implants reported in the first quarter of 2015. Most of this expected shortfall is attributable to the US market. With U.S. discounts in place, we should see implant levels rebound in upcoming quarters as we open new centers, qualify more patients and benefit from expanded reimbursement coverage.\nProduct and Clinical Development Plans\n \u00b7 In 2011, we received marketing approval in Europe (CE Mark) for the Argus II System. \nGoing Concern\nNet loss.\u2003The net loss was $23.0 million in 2013, as compared to $35.2 million in 2014.\n \u00b7 In 2006, we commenced clinical trials for the Argus II System, which later became our first commercial product. \nOperating Expenses.\u2003We generally recognize our operating expenses as we incur them in four general operational categories: research and development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing, and general and administrative. Our operating expenses also include a non-cash component related to the amortization of deferred stock-based compensation allocated to research and development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing and general and administrative personnel. From time to time we have received grants from institutions or agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, to help fund the some of the cost of our development efforts. We have recorded these grants as offsets to the costs as they are incurred to complete the related work.\nAmortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes decreased from $5.1 million in 2014 to $0 in 2015. This decrease is due to the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, when all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company did not incur the amortization of issuance discount on the convertible promissory notes\nOur first commercial product, the Argus II System, is a retinal prosthesis that can provide some functional vision to individuals blinded by retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The Argus II System is an implantable neurostimulation device that uses electrical stimulation of the retina (based on a wireless video camera feed) to replace the function of the defunct photo-receptors in RP patients.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nWorking capital was $18.8 million at December 31, 2015, as compared to $33.5 million at December 31, 2014, a decrease of $14.7 million or 44.0%. Working capital was $33.5 million at December 31, 2014, as compared to $9.1 million at December 31, 2013, an increase of $24.4 million or 268%. We use our cash, money market funds and working capital to fund our operating activities.\nManagement does not believe that any other recently issued, but not yet effective, authoritative guidance, if currently adopted, would have a material impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \u2022 The Argus II System \n \nThe formula to determine the number of IPO Supplemental Shares to be issued on a trigger of the Long Term Investor Right will be: (i) $18.00 minus (ii) the average of the highest consecutive closing prices in any 90 day trading period on the principal exchange during the two years after the Closing Date (the Measurement Average\u201d) divided by the Measurement Average. Fractional shares issuable to a qualifying IPO Shareholder resulting from the calculation will be rounded up to the next whole share of common stock, taking into account the aggregate number of Long Term Investor Rights of a holder. As an illustrative example, if the highest average of consecutive closing prices over any 90 calendar day period is $10.00 per share, each Long-Term Investor Right will be entitled to 0.80 additional shares of common stock, which is calculated as: ($18.00 - $10.00)/$10.00.\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the fee is fixed or determinable, collectability is probable, and delivery has occurred.\nThe IPO offering price for purposes of the calculation of the amount of common stock to be issued on a Long Term Investor Right will be subject to adjustment in the event of a reorganization, recapitalization or split-up of the Company's shares, the issuance of a stock dividend or any similar event. The amount of IPO Supplemental Shares, if any, to be issued will be computed by an independent public accountant as soon as practicable following the second anniversary of the Closing Date. The determination by such independent public accountant will be final and binding on the Company and on all qualifying IPO Shareholders and the Company will within about 15 days after receipt of written determination deliver to shareholders certificates evidencing the additional shares.\n \nOur Swiss subsidiary rents office space in Switzerland on a month-to-month basis for CHF 8,200 (approximately $8,200) per month.\nOur financial statements have been presented on the basis that our business is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with a business with one product line and limited commercial product revenues, including limitations on our operating capital resources and uncertain demand for our products. We have incurred recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative operating cash flows for at least the next few years. As a result, management has concluded that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, and our independent registered public accounting firm, in its report on our 2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales decreased from $5.6 million in 2013 to $3.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 36%. This decrease is primarily due to increasing our production volume and yields in 2014 relative to 2013, resulting in more finished goods and sub-assemblies being accepted into inventory and a lower level of scrapped product being expenses. As we manufacture more products, our manufacturing overhead is spread over more units and our cost per unit produced decreases. Also, as our yields improve and we accept more units into inventory, the amount of scrapped product that is written off to cost of sales decreases. We will continue to invest in improving our manufacturing processes, and we expect that manufacturing yields will improve and cost of sales will decrease relative to our revenues over the next few years, although we expect significant fluctuations on a quarter to quarter basis.\nNet sales.\u2003Our net sales are derived primarily from the sale of our Argus II System. We began selling our products in Europe in 2011, Saudi Arabia in 2012, in the United States and Canada in 2014, and in Turkey in 2015. Our objective is to increase our product revenue over the next several years as we pursue commercialization of our product, as our product becomes more well-known and accepted in the market, and as insurance coverage becomes more widespread.\nWe have received verbal assurances from two shareholders, one of whom is currently a director of the Company, and the other of whom is an affiliate of an early investor in the Company, that they will each exercise their subscription rights in full. In addition, to the extent that other shareholders do not exercise their subscription rights in full, these two shareholders have also provided verbal assurances to us that they will exercise their respective over-subscription privileges at the subscription price, to allow these shareholders to make an aggregate investment in us of up to $12.75 million. Accordingly, the rights offering is expected to raise a minimum of $12.75 million and a maximum of approximately $19.8 million in gross proceeds. We expect that the rights offering may close during the second quarter of 2016. The director/shareholder has also been granted the right, but not the obligation, to provide all of the remaining unsubscribed amounts, up to the aggregate balance of the amount not taken up in the rights offering by our other shareholders. We believe that these two shareholders have the financial capability to meet these financial commitments to us as described herein.\n \u2022 Hospital start up kits (one per site), \nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2015 and\nThe Company also sells surgical supplies to customers and recognizes revenue on these products when they are shipped and other revenue recognition criteria have been met.\nPatent Costs.\u2003The Company has over 345 domestic and foreign patents. Due to the uncertainty associated with the successful development of one or more commercially viable products based on Company's research efforts and any related patent applications, all patent costs, including patent-related legal, filing fees and other costs, including internally generated costs, are expensed as incurred. Patent costs are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company will issue IPO Supplemental Shares to IPO Shareholders who have not otherwise forfeited their Long Term Investor Right if, during the two-year period immediately following the IPO closing date, the Company's common stock does not trade at or above $18.00 per share (200% of the IPO price per share) for any five consecutive day period. If the Company's common stock trades on its principal exchange at 200% of the IPO price per share or greater on five consecutive trading days during the two years after the IPO closing date, the Long Term Investor Right will terminate.\nFinancing activities provided $2.8 million of cash in 2015, including $2.7 million from stock option and warrant exercises, issuance of common stock for ESPP purchases of $0.2 million offset by $0.1 million for payment of employment taxes related to stock option exercises. Financing activities provided $43.8 million of cash in 2014, including of $34.2 million net proceeds from our IPO, $9.1 million from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock at $7.00 per share in a private placement, and $0.5 million from stock option and warrant exercises\nFuture minimum rental payments required under the operating leases are as follows for the years ended December 31 (in thousands).\n \nWe are currently working on new external hardware and software for our Argus II System, which we believe may improve the performance characteristics, ease of use and resolution of the system. In the first half of 2016, we plan to introduce new clinical software to be used for adjusting the Argus II that we believe will help clinicians with the initial programming and follow up training of patients. In early 2017, we plan to introduce new eyewear and a new VPU that will allow us to implement some software enhancements that may improve the performance of the Argus II System. For example, improving the resolution of the system may enhance the user experience and increase our potential market size. Improved image resolution may be achieved by enhanced image processing, including contrast enhancement and electronic zooming.\nThe amount of revenue recognized per implant in a period depends on several factors, including reimbursement policies set by private and government payers, the mix of implants between EMEA and North America, exchange rates, payment terms that may affect revenue recognition, and sales of ancillary products, such as clinical start-up kits and surgical supplies. Given the recent CMS pricing decision discussed above, we made the determination in late February 2016 to temporarily discount the Argus device in the US to approximately $92,000 compared to the $144,000 we sold the product for in 2015. Accordingly, we expect that our average revenue per implant will be lower in 2016 than it was in 2015. The actual impact of this pricing decision on our average revenue will depend on the number of US patients implanted with the Argus II in a given period. Beyond 2016, our average revenue per implant may increase if we are successful in negotiating with CMS to increase the Medicare FFS reimbursement rate for the Argus II System. No assurance can be given, however, that we will be successful in doing so.\n \u2022 Training, and \n \nConvertible Promissory Notes and Warrants.\u2003The warrants and embedded beneficial conversion feature of convertible promissory notes are classified as equity under FASB ASC Topic 815-40 Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity\u201d. The Company allocates the proceeds of the convertible promissory notes between convertible promissory notes and the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes based on their relative fair values at the commitment date. The fair value of the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the respective allocated proceeds to the warrants is recorded in additional paid-in capital. The Company utilized the Black-Scholes option valuation model using the same valuation assumptions as described herein for Stock Based Compensation. The embedded beneficial conversion feature associated with convertible promissory notes is recognized and measured by allocating a portion of the proceeds equal to the intrinsic value of that feature to additional paid-in capital in accordance with ASC Topic 470-20 Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options.\u201d The portion of debt discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the financial instruments related to warrants associated with convertible promissory notes is being amortized over the life of the convertible promissory notes. For the portion of debt discount resulting from the allocation of proceeds to the beneficial conversion feature, it is amortized over the term of the notes from the respective dates of issuance.\n \u00b7 A $4.1 million grant under Joint Research and Development Agreement with The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in 2014, \nResearch and development expense.\u2003Research and development expense decreased from $5.0 million in 2014 to $3.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.0 million, or 40%. The decrease is primarily attributable to utilizing $1.9 million of grant funding from The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory to offset labor, consulting and overhead costs incurred during 2015 compared to no grant funding in the prior year. To date, we have recognized $1.9 million out of a total $4.1 million related to this grant. We expect research and development costs to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future cortical implant product.\nFinancing activities provided $43.8 million of cash in 2014, including of $34.2 million net proceeds from our IPO, $9.1 million from the issuance of 1.3 million shares of common stock at $7.00 per share in a private placement, and $0.5 million from stock option and warrant exercises. Financing activities provided $21.9 million of cash in 2013, including $19.5 million from the issuance of convertible promissory notes primarily to existing investors and $2.4 million from the issuance of 0.3 million shares of common stock to new investors at $7.00 per share to new investors and $0.1 million from stock option exercises, offset by a convertible note repayment of $0.1 million.\n \u00b7 Issuance of convertible debt with the face value of $19.5 million in 2013, \n \u00b7 Revenue of $8.9 million, $3.4 million, and $1.6 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, generated by sales of our Argus II System, \nIn February 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-02 (ASU 2015-02), Consolidation (Topic 810). ASU 2015-02 changes the guidance with respect to the analysis that a reporting entity must perform to determine whether it should consolidate certain types of legal entities. All legal entities are subject to reevaluation under the revised consolidation mode. ASU 2015-02 affects the following areas: (1) limited partnerships and similar legal entities; (2) evaluating fees paid to a decision maker or a service provider as a variable interest; (3) the effect of fee arrangements on the primary beneficiary determination; (4) the effect of related parties on the primary beneficiary determination; and (5) certain investment funds. ASU 2015-02 is effective for public business entities for fiscal years, and for interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. If an entity early adopts the guidance in an interim period, any adjustments should be reflected as of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes that interim period. A reporting entity may apply the amendments in this guidance using a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulative-effect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. A reporting entity also may apply the amendments retrospectively. The adoption of ASU 2015-02 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n\nIn February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02 regarding leases. The new standard requires lessee recognition on the balance sheet of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability, initially measured at the present value of the lease payments. It further requires recognition in the income statement of a single lease cost, calculated so that the cost of the lease is allocated over the lease term on a generally straight-line basis. Finally, it requires classification of all cash payments within operating activities in the statement of cash flows. It is effective for fiscal years commencing after December 15, 2018 and early adoption is permitted. Management has not yet evaluated the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\nInsurance Reimbursement\nSelling and marketing expense.\u2003Selling and marketing expense increased from $3.3 million in 2013 to $6.8 million in 2014, an increase of $3.5 million, or 106%. This increase in costs is attributable to an increase in personnel, as well as higher costs for marketing and customer awareness programs, as we increased our efforts to commercialize the Argus II System as, beginning in 2014, we began selling our product in the United States, Canada and Spain. While we expect these costs to increase in the future as we increase our selling and marketing resources to accelerate the commercialization of our product, we expect selling and marketing expense to decrease over time when expressed as a percentage of product revenue.\nAt December 31, 2015, the Company did not have any transactions, obligations or relationships that could be considered off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCurrently, our Argus II System is approved for persons suffering from RP. We believe we may be able to expand the market for the Argus II System beyond RP to patients with severe to profound vision loss due to dry age-related macular degeneration, or AMD. We are currently enrolling and implanting patients in a pilot study, of about five patients, to evaluate the safety and benefit of the Argus II System for use in persons suffering from AMD. Based on the results from this study, we could begin a larger scale efficacy trial. The size and timing of the pivotal study are dependent on multiple factors including the actual subset of AMD patients we target and whether we decide to modify the Argus II system prior to commencing a pivotal study. The subset of patients will influence the regulatory and reimbursement pathways, the size of the study and the length of time required to enroll the study. The company is also evaluating the potential benefits of system changes optimized for AMD. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in any of these endeavors. If the Argus II System is successfully developed and approved for sale to treat AMD, as to which there can be no assurances, we believe that the potential addressable market opportunity for that device will significantly exceed our existing RP markets for the Argus II System.\nAmortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes increased from $3.4 million in 2013 to $5.1 million in 2014, an increase of $1.7 million or 50%. This increase is due to the higher average level of debt outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013, although the debt was only outstanding for ten and one-half months in 2014, and to higher value attributed to the beneficial conversion feature associated with promissory notes issued during 2013, but which was only outstanding for a part of 2013. As a result of the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company will no longer incur the amortization of issuance discount on convertible promissory notes.\n \u00b7 Expected dividend yield is based on current yield at the grant date or the average dividend yield over the historical period. The Company has never declared or paid dividends and has no plans to do so in the foreseeable future. \nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Certain accounting policies and estimates are particularly important to the understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management or can be materially affected by changes from period to period in economic factors or conditions that are outside of our control. As a result, they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. In applying these policies, our management uses their judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates. Those estimates are based on our historical operations, our future business plans and projected financial results, the terms of existing contracts, our observance of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. See Note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of our significant accounting policies.\nGeneral and administrative expense.\u2003General and administrative expense increased from $4.2 million in 2013 to $6.6 million in 2014, an increase of $2.4 million or 57%. This increase is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of higher stock-based compensation charges in 2014, $0.8 million in higher compensation costs, which includes $0.4 million due to forgiveness of a loan receivable to an officer to finance stock options, $0.2 million of expense related to a stock award to the Company's Chairman, as well as higher spending on patent and audit related fees. The stock-based compensation charge in 2014 includes $0.6 million related to option grants to our chief executive officer. After we become a public company, we expect our general and administrative costs to increase as we incur the additional costs of being a public company, including higher legal, accounting, insurance, exchange listing, and other costs.\nIn the United States, the amount of sales revenue recognized per unit has been limited in some situations due to the uncertainties of the reimbursement environment and payment terms. Favorable claims outcomes and the development of positive coverage policies in the United States may eventually result in greater and earlier revenue recognition.\nIn the United States, the amount of revenue recognized per unit has been limited in some situations due to the uncertainties of the reimbursement environment and payment terms. In such cases, revenue is not recognized until the consideration becomes fixed, generally when paid to the Company.\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09 (ASU 2014-09), Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-09 will eliminate transaction- and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replace it with a principle based approach for determining revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 will require that companies recognize revenue based on the value of transferred goods or services as they occur in the contract. ASU 2014-09 also will require additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts, including significant judgments and changes in judgments and assets recognized from costs incurred to obtain or fulfill a contract. Based on the FASB's Exposure Draft Update issued on April 29, 2015, and approved in July 2015, Revenue from Contracts With Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of the Effective Date, ASU 2014-09 is now effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Entities will be able to transition to the standard either retrospectively or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. The Company is evaluating ASU 2014-9, and has not yet determined its impact to the Company's financial statements, nor decided the transition approach it will take.\nIn 2015, 32 individuals in the US and Canada received and were implanted with the Argus II technology. Of these, nine were Medicare FFS patients, 13 were Medicare Advantage patients and three were commercially insured patients. The remaining seven patients were covered by private pay, Veteran's Administration, or other insurers.\nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales increased from $3.6 million in 2014 to $5.3 million in 2015, an increase of $1.7 million or 47%. This increase is primarily due to increasing our production volume and yields in 2015 relative to 2014, resulting in more finished goods and sub-assemblies being accepted into inventory and a lower level of scrapped product being expensed. As we manufacture more products, our manufacturing overhead is spread over more units and our cost per unit produced decreases. Also, as our yields improve and we accept more units into inventory, the amount of scrapped product that is written off to cost of sales decreases. We will continue to invest in improving our manufacturing processes. However, if we produce fewer units in 2016, our cost per unit produced could increase. Additionally, our lower expected revenue per implant in 2016, as discussed above, will most likely lead to lower gross margins being recognized in 2016 than in 2015.\nGeneral and administrative expense.\u2003General and administrative expense increased from $6.6 million in 2014 to $8.2 million in 2015, an increase of $1.6 million, or 24%. This increase is primarily attributable to $0.8 million of higher stock-based compensation charges in 2015, $0.5 million in higher compensation costs, as well as higher legal, accounting, insurance and regulatory costs associated with being a public company.\nDuring 2015, we used $20.6 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $20.0 million, offset by non-cash charges of $3.3 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $3.9 million. This compares to 2014, when we used $17.1 million of cash in operating activities, consisting of a net loss of $35.2 million, offset by a non-cash charge of $6.9 million for the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the automatic conversion of convertible debt triggered by our IPO, reduced by non-cash charges of $9.6 million for amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, a stock grant to a related party, common stock issued for services, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million.\n \u00b7 Research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and consulting costs related to the design, development, and enhancements of our current and potential future products, offset by grant revenue received in support of specific research projects. We expense our research and development costs as they are incurred. We expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future products, such as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis. We also expect to receive additional grants in the future that will be offset primarily against research and development costs. \nThe Right is an equity instrument that is accounted for as a component of the actual price per common share paid by the investor in the IPO. For basic earnings per share, the common shares associated with the Right are treated as contingently issuable shares and will not be included in basic earnings per share until the actual number of shares can be calculated and the shares have been issued.\n \u00b7 In 2015, we commenced a clinical trial in the UK for an expanded indication for the Argus II System in individuals with dry AMD. \n \u00b7 The risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield in effect at the time of grant. \nAmortization of discount on convertible promissory notes.\u2003As discussed more fully above, our convertible promissory notes issued during 2012 and 2013 were issued with detachable warrants and an embedded beneficial conversion feature, which were recorded as an issuance discount with an offsetting credit to additional paid-in capital. This issuance discount was amortized as a non-cash charge over the term of the convertible promissory note. The terms of the convertible promissory notes provided for conversion into equity on an IPO, at $5.00 per share. At December 31, 2013, the unamortized issuance cost related to our convertible promissory notes was $12.0 million. As a result of our IPO in November 2014, $7.0 million of unamortized issuance costs were charged to income due to the automatic conversion of all outstanding convertible promissory notes into common stock.\nA significant focus for 2016, and beyond, will be expanding US reimbursement coverage and working with Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to establish Medicare hospital outpatient and ambulatory surgery center payment rates that are in line with facility costs. We have individuals working at Second Sight dedicated to reimbursement and employ a variety of consultants with expertise in this field. Currently, five MACs that oversee 17 states and two US Territories have agreed to cover the Argus II System when medically necessary for the FDA approved indications. The MACs now covering the Argus II include First Coast Service Options (covers on a case-by-case basis for Florida, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands), CGS Administrators, LLC (for the states of Ohio and Kentucky), Palmetto GBA (for the states of North and South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia, other than the counties of Arlington and Fairfax in Virginia and the City of Arlington in Virginia), National Government Services, Inc. (NGS), Jurisdiction 6 (for the states of Illinois, Minnesota and Wisconsin), and NGS, Jurisdiction K (for the states of Connecticut, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont). We are actively engaged with the remaining MACs and are committed to providing them with clinical evidence to support our requests for coverage. We expect that additional positive coverage decisions will be issued over time but cannot predict timing or ultimate success with each MAC.\n \u00b7 Clinical and regulatory expenses consist primarily of salaries, travel and related expenses for personnel engaged in clinical and regulatory functions, as well as internal and external costs associated with conducting clinical trials and maintaining relationships with regulatory agencies. We expect clinical and regulatory expenses to increase as we assess the safety and efficacy of enhancements to our current Argus II System, seek to expand the indications for the Argus II System, such as AMD, and prepare to initiate clinical studies of potential future products, such as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis. \nWe began selling the Argus II System in Europe at the end of 2011, in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and in the United States and Canada in 2014, and in Turkey in 2015. We have limited regulatory approval in Canada and Saudi Arabia, and we are currently applying for full approval. To date, all of our sales have been made by our direct sales force, but we plan to add partners and distributors to enhance our coverage of existing and future markets. In 2014, we entered into our first distribution agreements, that cover the countries of Spain and Turkey, and we are at various stages of negotiations with a number of other distributors for countries in Europe and the Middle East.\n \u00b7 Issuance of common stock in a private placements aggregating $9.1 million and $2.4 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, and \nOur company's consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We have experienced recurring operating losses and negative operating cash flows since inception, and have financed our working capital requirements through the recurring sale of our equity securities in both public and private offerings. As a result, our independent registered public accounting firm, in its current report on our 2015 consolidated financial statements, has raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern (see Going Concern\u201d above\u201d).\n \u00b7 General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive, legal, finance, human resources, information technology and administrative personnel, as well as recruiting and professional fees, patent filing costs, insurance costs and other general corporate expenses, including rent. We expect general and administrative expenses to increase as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and operate as a public company. \n \n \u00b7 The grant price of the issuances, with certain exceptions, is determined based on the estimated fair value of the shares at the date of grant. \n \u00b7 Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries, commissions, travel and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales, marketing and business development functions, as well as costs associated with promotional and other marketing activities. We expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as we hire additional sales personnel, initiate additional marketing programs, develop relationships with new distributors, and expand the number of doctors and medical centers that buy and implant our Argus II System and any future products. \nInterest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense on the convertible promissory notes decreased from $2.0 million in 2014 to $0 in 2015. This decrease is due to the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, when all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company did not incur interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nInterest expense on convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense was a non-cash expense associated with the Company's convertible promissory notes. Simple interest was accrued at 7.5% per annum based on the face value of the convertible promissory notes outstanding during the year. The accrued interest was added to the amount of outstanding debt, but does not earn additional interest. The terms of the convertible promissory notes provided for automatic conversion of principal and accrued interest into equity on our IPO, at $5.00 per share. Accordingly, subsequent to our IPO in the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company no longer incurred interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nBusiness Overview\n \nWe are actively engaged with CMS concerning the outpatient payment rate for Medicare FFS patients. As discussed above, the 2016 Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate for the Argus procedure is $95,000. Based on available cost information, the Medicare hospital outpatient payment rate should be at least $150,000 to fully cover the hospitals' costs for the device and procedure (with physician fees being billed and reimbursed separately). Our efforts have been focused on changing the 2016 payment rate to be more reflective of hospitals' actual costs. As of March 1, 2016, we are operating our business with the belief that the US outpatient payment rate will remain $95,000 in 2016. In parallel, the company is focused on obtaining a 2017 outpatient payment rate that adequately covers hospital costs. Several paths exist to accomplishing this goal including continued education of hospitals concerning the importance of properly coding, billing and submitting Argus II Medicare claims. This activity is important to establish an accurate claims data base that CMS will use to set future payment rates. Finally, the company is exploring other options for changes to Medicare payment policy that may facilitate appropriate reimbursement. No assurance can be given that the company will be successful in any of these endeavors.\nObtaining reimbursement from governmental and private insurance companies is critical to our future commercial success. Due to the cost of the Argus II System, our sales would be limited without the availability of third party reimbursement. In the US, coding, coverage, and payment are necessary for the surgical procedure and Argus II system to be reimbursed by payers. Coding has been established for the device and the surgical procedure. Coverage and payment vary by payer. Argus II patients are eligible for Medicare, and coverage is primarily provided through traditional Medicare (sometimes referred to as Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS)) or Medicare Advantage. A small percentage of patients are covered by commercial insurers.\nOn January 25, 2016, we filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission to conduct a registered rights offering as of a future record date to allow the holders of our common stock to purchase newly-issued shares of common stock. The shares will be offered at the lower of $4.25 per share or 85% of the closing price of the Company's common stock as reported by Nasdaq on the last day of the offering period. Assuming full subscription and a closing stock price of between $4.00 and $6.00 per share on the last day of the offering period, we expect to sell between 4.6 million and 5.8 million shares of common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $19.8 million. The actual number of shares sold and proceeds raised will depend on, among other factors, the extent to which current shareholders participate in the rights offering and the final price per share at which we sell our common stock. We intend to use the proceeds from this rights offering to invest in our business to expand sales and marketing efforts, enhance current products, gain regulatory approvals for additional indications, and continue research and development into next generation technology.\nNet loss.\u2003The net loss was $35.2 million in 2014, as compared to $20.0 million in 2015. The $15.2 million reduction in net loss from 2014 to 2015 was primarily attributable to approximately $14.1 million of non-cash charges related to convertible debt and the conversion of convertible debt into common stock as a result of the Company's IPO in November 2014. These expenses include approximately $2.0 million in non-cash interest expense, $5.1 million for the amortization of debt issuance discounts, and $7.0 million related to the write-off of unamortized debt issuance discounts.\n \nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nResults of Operations\nWithin Europe, we have obtained reimbursement approval in Germany, France and two regions of Italy. We also are seeking reimbursement approval in other countries including the United Kingdom, Belgium, Netherlands, Switzerland and Turkey. In France, Second Sight was selected to receive the first \"Forfait Innovation\" (Innovation Bundle) from the Ministry of Health, which is a special funding program for breakthrough procedures to be introduced into clinical practice. As part of this program, Second Sight is conducting a post-market study in France which will enroll a total of 18 subjects and follow them for two years. The French program will fund implantation of up to 18 additional patients that will not be part of the post-market study. After review of the study's results, we expect Argus II therapy to be covered and funded through the standard payment system in France, however, we can provide no assurance that the French government will continue to fund the Argus II after the first 36 implants.\n \nCost of sales.\u2003Cost of sales includes the salaries, benefits, material, overhead, third party costs, warranty, charges for excess and obsolete inventory, and other costs required to make our Argus II System at our Sylmar, California facility. Historically, our cost of sales has been greater than our revenues, which has resulted in gross losses. However, in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 and for all of fiscal 2015, due to higher revenues and increased manufacturing output and efficiencies, we generated a positive gross margin. Our product involves new and technologically complex materials and processes. As we move from making small quantities of our product for clinical trials to larger quantities for commercial distribution, we are developing new manufacturing techniques and processes that we expect to allow us to scale production. We are currently experiencing low yields on our manufacturing process, but we expect that over the next few years we will be able to refine our processes and improve our manufacturing yields. Accordingly, as we produce in quantities sufficient to support our commercial efforts, we expect that we will generate a positive gross profit.\nOn November 18, 2014, we sold 4,025,000 shares of common stock in an IPO, including 525,000 shares sold upon exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option, at a price of $9.00 per share. Our net proceeds totaled $34.2 million after cash offering costs of $2.0 million, and excluding non-cash costs of $2.9 million for the fair value of warrants and common stock issued in connections with services rendered.\nRevenue is generated under sales agreements with multiple deliverables (multiple-element arrangements), comprising the following deliverables:\nInvesting activities in 2015 provided $17.5 million of cash, reflecting $18.3 million in proceeds from money market investments offset by $0.8 million for the purchase of equipment.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nWrite-off of unamortized discount on conversion of convertible promissory notes.\u2003The original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes specified that the notes automatically converted into common stock of the Company in the event, among other things, of an IPO. Accordingly, as of the IPO date, the Company wrote off $7.0 million of deferred issuance costs related to the convertible promissory notes that converted into common stock.\nSelling and marketing expense.\u2003Selling and marketing expense increased from $6.8 million in 2014 to $8.9 million in 2015, an increase of $2.1 million or 31%. This increase in costs is attributable to an increase in personnel, as well as higher costs for marketing and customer awareness programs, as we increased our efforts to commercialize the Argus II System. Beginning in 2014, we began selling our product in the United States, Canada and Spain. These costs increased as we intensified our selling and marketing efforts to accelerate the commercialization of our product, but we expect selling and marketing expense to decrease over time when expressed as a percentage of product revenue.\nThe Company has identified and will track IPO Investors who have perfected their Rights on a quarterly basis. At the end of each reporting period, the Company will disclose the potential dilutive effect of the Right, including the number of common shares that would be issuable on such date, based on the actual share price movements since the IPO.\nThe Company sells through distributors in certain countries. The Company provides these distributors with clinical start-up kits, surgical supplies and the Argus II System, as well as training them to provide pre- and post-surgical support. The Company monitors the surgery. Other than surgical support which is provided by the Company, the distributor is responsible for delivering products and services to its customers. In the past, the Company has allowed distributors to return or exchange products in certain situations. Due to the Company's continuing involvement and its returns policy, the Company recognizes revenue from distributors when the implantation procedure has been performed by the distributor's customer, and all other revenue recognition criteria between the Company and the distributor have been met.\n \u00b7 Medicare FFS patients - Coverage is determined by Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) that administer various geographic regions of the US. As of March 1, 2016, five of 12 MACs (17 states, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands) have made positive coverage decisions for the Argus II. Effective January 1, 2016, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) established a New Technology Ambulatory Payment Class (APC) 1599, Level 48, with a payment rate of $95,000 for both the procedure and the Argus II Retinal Prosthesis System. From October 1, 2013 through December 31, 2015, the Argus II was classified as having pass-through payment status and the device was paid separately from the procedure. \nNet Sales.\u2003Our net sales increased from $1.6 million in 2013 to $3.4 million in 2014, an increase of $1.8 million or 113%. This increase in product revenue was due to selling more implants in 2014 and attaining a higher average selling price for implanted devices. We sold 29 Argus II Systems that were implanted in 2014, compared to 22 in the prior year. In 2013, all implants were in Europe and the Middle East, whereas in 2014, there were 16 implants in the United States and Canada and 13 in Europe and the Middle East. The decrease in implants in Europe and the Middle East during 2014, as compared to 2013, is primarily due to sites in Italy and Saudi Arabia, which together accounted for 10 implants in 2013, performing no implants in the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, before resuming activity with a combined 4 implants in the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase in average selling price in 2014 was primarily due to establishing a higher selling price on the introduction of the Argus II system in the United States and Canada, combined with a lower level of discounting and free goods in Europe in comparison to 2013.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\n \u00b7 As permitted by SAB 107, due to the Company's insufficient history of option activity, management utilizes the simplified approach to estimate the options expected term, which represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. \nIn accordance with the original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes, the notes converted into the Company's common stock upon the Company's IPO. In November 2014, convertible promissory notes with a face value of $29.5 million, plus accrued interest of $3.7 million, converted into 6.6 million shares of common stock.\n \u00b7 Commercially insured patients - Commercial insurance plans make coverage and payment rate decisions independent of Medicare decisions and contracts are individually negotiated with facility and physician providers. \nTo date, we have not faced traditional sales challenges in any of our markets, largely due to the currently unmet clinical need and the lack of any other available device or competitive treatment for RP-caused profound blindness. Our marketing activities have focused on raising awareness of the Argus II System with potential patients, implanting physicians, and referring physicians. Our marketing activities include exhibiting, sponsoring symposia, and securing podium presence at professional and trade shows, securing journalist coverage in popular and trade media, attending patient meetings focused on educating patients about existing and future treatments, and sponsoring information sessions for the Argus II System. In the US, our efforts in 2016 will focus on presenting media ads dedicated to RP patients and their families. These ads will be placed in geographic areas where we have proven implanting centers and established reimbursement. Based on pilot efforts we conducted in 2015 we believe this may be a cost-efficient method to connect qualified patients with Argus II implanting centers. As of March 1, 2016 as a result of these efforts the Company had a patient interest list with over 150 conditionally qualified individuals.\nEffective August 2012, we entered into a lease agreement (the Sylmar Lease\u201d) with a Company owned by the major stockholder of the Company for office space for a term of five years that was to expire on February 28, 2017. The Sylmar Lease included rental of additional space commencing January 1, 2013 and a five year option to renew. The lease requires us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance each year, and is subject to periodic cost of living adjustments. In April 2014, the Sylmar Lease was renegotiated with the term ending on February 28, 2022, and a five year option to renew. The new lease also requires us to pay real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance each year and includes automatic increases in base rent each year. In November 2014, the industrial center in which Company's premises are located was sold to an independent third party.\nRevenue Recognition.\u2003The Company's revenue is derived primarily from the sale of its Argus II retinal implant, which is implanted during retinal surgery to restore some functional vision to patients blinded by Retinitis Pigmentosa. The Company sells to a variety of customers including university hospitals, large medical centers and distributors.\n \u00b7 Medicare Advantage patients - Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover the same benefits as those covered by the MAC in that jurisdiction. For example, if a MAC in a jurisdiction has favorable coverage for the Argus II, then all Medicare Advantage plans in that MAC jurisdiction are required to offer the same coverage for the Argus II. Individual hospitals and ASCs may negotiate Medicare Advantage contracts specific to that individual facility, which may include additional separate payment for the Argus II implant system. In addition, procedural payment is variable and can be based on a percentage of billed charges, payment groupings or other individually negotiated payment methodologies. Medicare Advantage plans also allow providers to confirm coverage and payment for the Argus II procedure in advance of implantation. In 2015, 93% or 13 of 14 Medicare Advantage pre-authorization requests were granted. \nIn order to determine whether collection is reasonably assured, the Company assesses a number of factors, including creditworthiness of the customer and medical insurance coverage. The Company may periodically grant extended payment terms to customers. In such situations, the Company defers the recognition of revenue until collection becomes probable, which is generally upon receipt of payment.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n \u00b7 In 2002, we commenced clinical trials for our prototype product, the Argus I retinal prosthesis. \nFrom inception, our operations have been funded primarily through the sales of our common stock, as well as from the issuance of convertible debt, research and clinical grants, and product revenue generated by the sale of our Argus II System. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we funded our business primarily through:\nInterest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\u2003Interest expense on the convertible promissory notes increased from $1.6 million in 2013 to $2.0 million in 2014, an increase of $0.4 million, or 25%. This increase is due to the higher average level of debt outstanding during 2014 compared to 2013, although the debt was only outstanding for ten and one-half months in 2014. As a result of the Company's IPO, effective November 18, 2014, all of the Company's convertible promissory notes were converted into common stock. After the IPO, the Company no longer incurred interest expense on the convertible promissory notes.\nWrite-off of unamortized discount on conversion of convertible promissory notes.\u2003The original terms of the Company's convertible promissory notes specified that the notes automatically converted into common stock of the Company in the event, among other things, of an IPO. Accordingly, as of the IPO date, the Company wrote off $7.0 million of deferred issuance costs related to the convertible promissory notes that converted into common stock.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-15 (ASU 2014-15), Presentation of Financial Statements - Going Concern (Subtopic 205-10). ASU 2014-15 provides guidance as to management's responsibility to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. In connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period, an entity's management should evaluate whether there are conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Management's evaluation should be based on relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably knowable at the date that the financial statements are issued (or at the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable). Substantial doubt about an entity's ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued (or available to be issued). ASU 2014-15 is effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. Early application is permitted. The adoption of ASU 2014-15 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation and disclosures.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of many factors. The consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any future period. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Form 10-K and in conjunction with the Risk Factors\u201d included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nLong Term Investor Right.\u2003Each beneficial owner ( IPO Shareholder\u201d) of the Company's common stock, who purchased shares directly in the offering ( IPO Shares\u201d), may qualify to receive up to one additional share of common stock from the Company for each share purchased in the offering ( IPO Supplemental Shares\u201d) pursuant to the Long Term Investor Right that was included with each IPO Share. To qualify for receipt of IPO Supplemental Shares, an IPO Shareholder was required to take action to become the direct registered owner of its IPO Shares within 90 days following the closing date of the offering, or by February 22, 2015. Furthermore, IPO Shareholders are required to hold their IPO Shares in their own name and not place them in street name\u201d or trade them at any time during the 24 month period immediately following the IPO closing date. This Long Term Investors Right is non-detachable and transferable only in limited circumstances.\n \u00b7 In 2007, we commenced clinical trials in the US for the Argus II System, which later became our first commercial product. \nClinical and regulatory expense.\u2003Clinical and regulatory expense decreased from $3.2 million in 2013 to $2.6 million in 2014, a decrease of $0.6 million, or 19%. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower levels of staffing in 2014 compared to 2013. We expect clinical and regulatory costs to increase in the future as we conduct clinical trials to assess possible enhancements to our existing product, and to assess the safety and efficacy of our current product for treating blindness due to age related macular degeneration.\nNo assurances can be given that we will ultimately be successful in completing this rights offering, or if unsuccessful, that we will be able to raise sufficient funds through other means so as to be able to continue operating our business at current levels beyond the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nResearch and development expense.\u2003Research and development expense increased from $3.2 million in 2013 to $5.0 million in 2014, an increase of $1.8 million, or 56%. This increase in expense is primarily related to work developing our next generation externals, which includes new eyewear and a new video processing unit. In 2014, we spent $0.9 million more on salaries and other compensation costs than in 2013, and we spent $0.3 million more on materials, consulting services and other supplies to make and evaluate prototypes. We expect research and development costs to increase in the future as we pursue further enhancements of our existing product and develop technology for our potential future cortical implant product.\n \n \nDuring 2014, we used $17.1 million of cash in operating activities, consisting primarily of a net loss of $35.2 million, offset by non-cash charges of $6.9 million for the write off of unamortized issuance costs related to the automatic conversion of convertible debt triggered by our IPO, $9.6 million for amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, a stock grant to a related party, common stock issued for services, and common stock issuable and decreased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $1.6 million. This compares to 2013, when we used $17.4 million of cash in operating activities, consisting of a net loss of $23.0 million, reduced by non-cash charges of $6.1 million for depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, stock-based compensation, amortization of discount on convertible notes payable, and non-cash interest accrued on convertible notes payable, and increased by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of $0.5 million.\nWe are also conducting preclinical development, including animal studies, of a product for cortical stimulation that we refer to as the Orion I visual cortical prosthesis (or Orion I\u201d), which we expect will be able to provide some vision restoration to individuals with almost all unpreventable forms of blindness. Our objective in designing and developing the Orion I is to bypass the retina and optic nerve and to directly stimulate the visual cortex region of the brain. Human clinical testing is likely to take the form of a feasibility study followed by a premarket approval pivotal trial. The details of these trials will be determined collaboratively with the FDA at that time. We cannot accurately estimate the timing or exact cost of these trials at this time. If the Orion I is successfully developed and approved for sale, as to which there can be no assurances, we believe that the potential addressable market opportunity for that device will greatly exceed our existing RP markets for the Argus II System.\nStock-Based Compensation.\u2003Pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) ASC 718 Share-Based Payment ( ASC 718\u201d), the Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based awards. Under ASC 718, the Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the option vesting term.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2014 and\n \u2022 Surgical support, \nThe deliverables may vary by transaction.\nClinical and regulatory expense.\u2003Clinical and regulatory expense increased from $2.6 million in 2014 to $3.5 million in 2015, an increase of $0.9 million, or 35%. This increase is primarily attributable to the cost of post-market and other clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of our current product, to assess possible enhancements to our existing product, and to assess the efficacy of our technology for treating blindness due to Age-Related Macular Degeneration.\nIn January 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-01 (ASU 2015-01), Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items (Subtopic 225-20). ASU 2015-01 eliminates from GAAP the concept of extraordinary items. Subtopic 225-20, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items, required that an entity separately classify, present, and disclose extraordinary events and transactions. Presently, an event or transaction is presumed to be an ordinary and usual activity of the reporting entity unless evidence clearly supports its classification as an extraordinary item. Paragraph 225-20-45-2 contains the following criteria that must both be met for extraordinary classification: (1) Unusual nature. The underlying event or transaction should possess a high degree of abnormality and be of a type clearly unrelated to, or only incidentally related to, the ordinary and typical activities of the entity, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates. (2) Infrequency of occurrence. The underlying event or transaction should be of a type that would not reasonably be expected to recur in the foreseeable future, taking into account the environment in which the entity operates. If an event or transaction meets the criteria for extraordinary classification, an entity is required to segregate the extraordinary item from the results of ordinary operations and show the item separately in the income statement, net of tax, after income from continuing operations. The entity also is required to disclose applicable income taxes and either present or disclose earnings-per-share data applicable to the extraordinary item. ASU 2015-01 is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2015. A reporting entity may apply the guidance prospectively. A reporting entity also may apply the guidance retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted provided that the guidance is applied from the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption. The adoption of ASU 2015-01 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \u00b7 In 1998, we were founded. \nNet Sales.\u2003Our net sales increased from $3.4 million in 2014 to $8.9 million in 2015, an increase of $5.5 million, or 162%. This increase in net sales was primarily due to selling 75 Argus II systems that were implanted in 2015 compared to 29 in 2014. Average revenue recognized per implant was fairly constant at approximately $119,000 in 2015 compared to $117,000 in 2014. In 2015, there were 43 implants in Europe and the Middle East (EMEA) compared to 13 implants in the prior year. The increase in implants in EMEA is primarily attributable to reimbursement programs in France and Italy, which combined accounted for 31 implants in 2015 compared to three in the 2014. In the United States and Canada (North America), implants increased to 32 in 2015 compared to 16 in 2014. We began selling the Argus II in North America in 2014, and the growth in 2015 represents the positive results of our ongoing commercial efforts.\nInvesting activities in 2014 used $25.9 million of cash, reflecting $25.4 million in purchases of money market investments and $0.5 million for the purchase of equipment.\n \u00b7 In 2014, we completed our initial public offering and began trading on NASDAQ under the symbol EYES.\u201d \nOur major corporate, clinical and regulatory milestones include:\nWe were founded in 1998 with a mission to develop, manufacture, and market prosthetic devices that restore vision to the blind.

ASU 2015-17 requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial position. ASU 2015-17 is effective for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, and interim periods within those annual periods. Earlier application is permitted as of the beginning of an interim or annual reporting period. The adoption of ASU 2015-17 is not expected to have any impact on Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \nThe Company evaluates each deliverable in a multiple-element arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting. An element constitutes a separate unit of accounting when the delivered item has standalone value and delivery of the undelivered element is probable and within the Company's control. The Company has determined that the elements listed above do not have standalone value to the customer until delivery of all components has occurred. Accordingly, revenue from multiple-element arrangements is recognized when delivery of all of deliverables has taken place and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Generally, revenue recognition occurs at the time of implantation, but revenue recognition can be delayed if certain training has not been delivered to the implanting sites, or if other revenue recognition criteria have not been met.\n \u00b7 Issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in November 2014, which generated net proceeds of $34.2 million of cash after offering expenses. \nFinancial Commitments\nInvesting activities in 2013 used $4.5 million of cash, reflecting $4.3 million in purchases of money market investments and $0.2 million used to purchase property and equipment in 2013.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-03 (ASU 2015-03), Interest - Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30). ASU 2015-03 simplifies the presentation of debt issuance costs and requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs are not affected by the new guidance. ASU 2015-3 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within that fiscal year. Early adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. An entity is required to apply the new guidance on a retrospective basis, wherein the balance sheet of each individual period presented is adjusted to reflect the period-specific effects of applying the new guidance. Upon transition, an entity is required to comply with the applicable disclosures for a change in an accounting principle. These disclosures include the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle, the transition method, a description of the prior-period information that has been retrospectively adjusted, and the effect of the change on the financial statement line items (i.e., debt issuance cost asset and the debt liability). The adoption of ASU 2015-03 is not expected to have any impact on the Company's financial statement presentation or disclosures.\n \u00b7 Volatility is determined based on average historical volatilities of comparable companies in similar industry.
