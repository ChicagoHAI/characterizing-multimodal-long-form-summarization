MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\nForward-Looking Statements\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d could,\u201d possibly,\u201d probably,\u201d anticipates,\u201d projects,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d or should\u201d or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nGeneral Overview\nWe operate two distinct business segments: Products Segment and Services Segment\nOur Products Segment designs and manufactures products for the subsea market including our range of flagship patented real time 3D sonar solutions ( Products Segment\u201d). These products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major Oil and Gas ( O&G\u201d) companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nOur Services Segment supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d) such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. We have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors and we use these credentials to secure more business. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts (or parts which we are preferred suppliers of) through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\nIn recent years, the Products and Services Segment have each generated 50% of our revenues. As a general rule, however, the Product Segment yields a higher Gross Profit Margin than the Services Segment. In both 2017 and 2018 fiscal years the Services Segment revenues and Net Income were substantially down and off plan due to the failure of new US Administration to pass a defense budget. This impact continued in 2018 on the Services Segment. In 2018 fiscal year therefore, Products Segment generated 64% of the Company's consolidated revenues and the Services Segment generated 36%. We consider this to be atypical and would anticipate in 2019 fiscal year Services Segment revenues will be more in line with 50% of our overall revenues.\nThe Services Segment has now started to receive the backlog orders that were due in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and have now contracted a backlog of $2,504,380 (for the 2017/2018 orders) and we expect the further outstanding backlog to be contracted in the first half of 2019. Our biggest risks for the 2019 fiscal year for this Segment is that of timely execution of its mounting backlog of orders. The current level of this Segment's order book is approximately $7.2m.\nAlthough our Products Segment continues to be affected by the contraction in expenditures in Offshore O&G activities, we have continued to find new markets for our subsea products, mainly our real time 3D sonar series and the launch of our Echoscope4G\u00ae Surface saw an increase in the number of units sold. We also continue to become a key sensor in Offshore Wind Energy where our technology is used for real time 3D visualization of the cable pull in points and cable touch down point. Our increased efforts including expenditures in research and development is designed to capture new markets in the subsea defense space where new technologies such as underwater drones present new challenges for governments. We continue to believe that our real time 3D sonar technology is significant for the subsea defense market which is worth billions annually. Our unique and patented real time 3D solutions are a significant advancement on the current technology available in the subsea sonar imaging market due to its real time capability providing real time volumetric data of underwater targets - both static and moving - in low or zero visibility conditions.\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSince introducing this product, we have made progress in getting our core real time 3D technology, the Echoscope\u00ae, adopted by a significant number of ports in the USA (the CodaOctopus\u00ae Underwater Inspection System where it is used for port and harbor security. In 2015 we secured the first sale of our Underwater Inspection System to a foreign government body in East Asia and in 2016 we sold two additional full system to this body.\nWe have also made progress in expanding the markets (and applications) for our real time 3D sonars. Recently, we have sold a number of systems to mining companies. Increasingly, our customers involved in offshore wind energy and renewables are adopting the technology as the primary tool for scour management, subsea cable installation and associated cable protection tasks.\nIn addition, in recent years we have started to rent our real time 3D solutions with engineering services. Given the contraction in capital expenditures budget in the O&G market, rentals are increasingly becoming an important part of the composition of the Company's revenues and these O&G operators are more prepared to utilize operational budgets. Furthermore, our rental offering generally yields a higher gross margin for the Company.\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>A. </td> <td>United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) including the possibility that such withdrawal will take place without a deal on their future relationship ( No Deal Brexit Issue\u201d)\nWe derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from our UK operations (both Coda Octopus Products Limited and Coda Octopus Martech).\nFollowing a national referendum, the United Kingdom Government has served notice to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The date of the UK leaving the European Union and the deadline for concluding a deal is currently March 29, 2019. Failing to conclude a deal could result in a No Deal Brexit or the UK Parliament intervening and seeking an extension on the March 29, 2019 date.\nA No Deal Brexit could affect our UK operations which represents a significant part of our earnings (Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh-based) and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (Portland, England-based).\nThe ongoing uncertainty also impacts the British Pound (which is the trading currency of our UK operations). This has adverse impact on revenues reported (due to depreciation of the British Pound against other major currencies including the US Dollar) and devaluation of our consolidated balance sheet assets.\nBecause there is no precedent for a European Union member state leaving the Union, the full implications for the Company are not clear. The outcome is dependent on the type of future relationship that is struck between the United Kingdom and the European Union. In a worst-case scenario, where no deal on the future of the UK relationship with European Union is struck, it is widely believed that the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules will apply. Operating on this basis would have far-reaching implications for our Company particularly in the area of costs associated with import/export arrangements for our products including custom duties on purchases and sales and delays and increased compliance costs in the supply chain (both purchasing and selling). We currently benefit from mutual recognition rules in a number of areas including export control requirements and quality standards which allow us to distribute our products freely in European Union. If these are removed it is likely to involve new qualifications requirements that we would need to meet with the attendant costs and delays involved. Furthermore, if free movement is restricted this will also limit our ability to utilize our trained engineers and experts on customer projects in the European Union.\nFurthermore, if the UK were to have an unplanned withdrawal this would compound the issues for our Company further as it is commonly believed that there would be resulting chaos and uncertainty, which would adversely affect the Company.\nIt is also widely believed that in a worst-case scenario, the British Pound will be exposed to extreme exchange rate fluctuations between the major currencies including US Dollar and Euro.\nMany companies are seeking to mitigate the impact by seeking certain trading licenses in European Union member state countries.\nIn anticipation of a No Deal Brexit, we are taking steps to mitigate this and have established a company, Coda Octopus Products A/S, in Denmark to maintain a presence in the European Union and to address the foreseeable issues. However, we can give no assurance that this in itself would be sufficient to address the impact of both a No Deal Brexit and an unplanned No Deal Brexit (i.e. crashing out of the European Union).\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>B. </td> <td>Currency Risks:\nThe Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Denmark. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 58%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (56% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d). In addition, a significant part of our assets (both current and fixed) are held in British Pounds by our foreign subsidiaries. The depreciation of the British Pound against major currencies adversely impacts our revenues as a whole which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures - see Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements) are maintained in U.S. Dollars. In the 2018 period as compared to the same 2017 period, we realized a consolidated balance sheet loss on our assets due to the weakening of the British Pound against the US Dollar prevailing at October 31, 2018. In fiscal year 2018 compared to the 2017 period, we incurred a loss on our exchange rate translations in respect of our comprehensive income and loss account. See Note 2, paragraph n, of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2018 and 2017 regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy.\nThis currency risk is further exacerbated by the uncertainty around Brexit.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>C. </td> <td>Trade Disputes:\nThe costs of our raw materials could become a serious concern due to inter-country trade disputes.

The decline in O&G prices since 2014 with a partial recovery since 2016 has resulted in large scale reductions in capital and operational expenditures, which directly impact on the Products Segment by reducing the quantity of sales and rentals into O&G and related markets. O&G has remained very competitive and customers are increasingly seeking significant discounts to place orders.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>E. </td> <td>Government Spending for Defense:\nThe allocation of funds to defense procurement by governments in the United States and the United Kingdom\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>F. </td> <td>Political Landscape:\nGlobal-political uncertainties affecting the markets into which we sell our goods and services.\nGlobal trends which make certain geographical regions more competitive in providing engineering solutions because of lower labor costs (e.g. India and China) are likely to affect our Services Segments (which provides engineering services).\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>G. </td> <td>Resourcing Levels\nBeing a small technology company, we are unable to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills as our remuneration package is not as competitive as those offered by bigger companies.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>H. </td> <td>Investments:\nWe lack the financial resources to advance our flagship technology at the commercially appropriate pace required to capture new markets and increase our sales which could facilitate new entrants to the market. For example, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, a multi-billion company, has recently acquired a number of subsea companies that may speed up their entry into our market.\nThe Company has limited external sources of capital available, and as such is reliant upon its ability to sell its products and services to provide sufficient working capital for its operations and obligations.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>I. </td> <td>Technological Advancement:\nA significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our patented real time 3D sonar technology. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can maintain our leading position in the real time 3D imaging sonar market or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our unique capability that we currently supply to subsea market.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is derived from sales of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services which we provide. Revenue is recognized when evidence of a contractual arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after delivery.\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue by allocating the total consideration to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable. Revenue from equipment and software sales are recognized when delivered, and revenue for installation and other services are recognized as they are performed.\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These amounts are reflected as liabilities and recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of a contractual arrangement for this, (2) collection of our fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable.\nFor arrangements that are generated from time and material contracts where there is a signed agreement and approved purchase order in place that specifies the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on material and direct labor hours incurred, revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total services (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as expenditures for direct materials and labor hours are considered to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nRental revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental period.\nOn November 1, 2018 the Company will adopt Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). While terminology and requirements change in ASC 606, we believe that our existing revenue accounting is compliant with ASC 606 and that our accounting for revenue will not change. Accordingly, our disclosures about our revenue in accordance with ASC 606 will expand to comply with the new requirements, including expansion of quarterly revenue reporting requirements.\nWe defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties.\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its' carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The Company will early adopt Accounting Standards Codification 2017 - 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which permits the Company to impair the difference between carrying amount in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as the reduction in goodwill. ASC 2017-04 eliminates the requirement in previous GAAP to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nAt the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit.\nFiscal Year 2018 Consolidated Results of Operations\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Marine Technology Business designs, manufactures, sells and rents patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products to the subsea market ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Marine Engineering Business supplies engineering services (from design, prototyping to manufacturing) to mainly prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nOur products and associated services are sold and/or rented to the offshore wind energy, dredging and marine construction, marine and port security, mining including deep sea mining, marine sciences sector and O&G sector. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Product Segment generated 64% and 61% of our total revenues.\nOur Services Segment designs and supplies engineering services largely for prime and sub-prime defense contractors.\nDuring the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Services Segment generated 36% and 39% of our total revenues.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 ( 2018 period\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 ( 2017 period\u201d)\nSee Segment information below for a full breakout of the financial performance of each Segment for the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively.\nThe information provided below pertains to the consolidated analysis of both segments (Products and Services) operating in our Group.\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue:\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>18,019,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,025,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 0.03% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe suffered a small decrease in revenues in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period. This is largely due to the Services Segment not achieving its revenue plan for fiscal year 2018 because of the delay in securing anticipated annual defense contracts resulting from the delay in the US Administration approving its defense budget. During the fiscal year ended 2018, the Products Segment generated revenues of $11,499,416 and Services Segment $6,570,013. During the 2018 period the Products Segment revenues grew by 4.2% over the 2017 period and the Services Segment revenues declined by 6.7% over the said period.\nThe Services Segment has now contracted backlog orders in the amount of $2,504,380 in respect of 2017 and 2018 and we expect the further outstanding backlog to be contracted in the first half of 2019. This Segment currently has an order book of $7.2m.\nDuring the 2018 period, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $2,882,761 or 16% of net revenues during the period. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2018 was $24,993 or 1% of accounts receivable.\nGross Margin:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>70.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 3.9 percentage points </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(gross profit of $12,662,362) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(gross profit of $11,967,725) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross margin reflects the different mix of consolidated sales in the 2018 period. In particular, the Products Segment, which generally yields a higher gross profit margin generated more revenues than the Services Segment. Furthermore, the Products Segment's gross profit margin is affected by the mix of outrights sales versus rentals. Rentals also yield a greater gross profit margin than outright sales. Within the mix of sales for the Products Segments there is an increase percentage relating to rentals and sale of newly launched 4G Products.\nResearch and Development (R&D):\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>2,571,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,380,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 86.3% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in our R&D expenditure in the 2018 period mainly reflects an increase in our R&D expenditure in the Products Segment.\nR&D expenditures in the Products Segment increased by 122.7% from $919,863 in the 2017 period to $2,048,285 in the 2018 period. This increase is in line with our budgetary plans and is a reflection of the increased activities in developing our 4G/5G of products.\nOur goal will be to bring more competitively priced and technologically advanced products to the market under a 12-18 months roll out plan. The first of our series of products in our 4G of products was launched in January, 2018, and we expect to launch further products within our 4G/5G series of sonar throughout 2019.\nR&D expenditures in the Services Segment were $523,429 in the 2018 period compared to $460,518 in the 2017 period, an increase of 13.7%. These expenditures are in line with our budgetary plans as we are investing significantly in the refreshing the Thermite\u00ae range of products which is a significant part of our growth strategy (Services Segment). The Thermite\u00ae is a product which we acquired from Quantum 3D in 2014 and it has a prestigious customer base. We believe that the technically refreshed Thermite presents a substantial opportunity to grow this part of our business and we have now completed the first development of the new Thermite\u00ae Octal and have received the first orders from 2 significant customers for trial versions. Thermite\u00ae enjoys a prestigious existing customer base which we intend to re-engage with this new Thermite\u00ae Octal.\nIn general, we expect R&D expenditures to continue to increase in the 2019 period for the reasons explained above. Notwithstanding this increase, it is the Company's current belief that it can fund these activities from its operating income.\nOur products are complex and, despite the increase in our R&D expenditures, we can give no assurance that we will realize our stated goals.

Approximately $586,436 of the increased amount in our SG&A expenditures constitutes non-recurring costs attributed to employees' separation payments and a further $90,000 associated with surrendering leased business property in Edinburgh.\nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31,\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>Expenditure </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Wages and Salaries </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,070,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,010,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 23.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and Professional Fees (including accounting, audit and investment banking services) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,054,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>934,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 12.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent for our various locations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 17% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 43.7 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAlthough there is a modest decrease in Wages and Salaries category of expenditures, we would expect that in the 2019 fiscal year this category will increase to reflect the investments we are making in our business including in the area of sales and marketing and quality control.\nThe increase in our Legal and Professional Fees in the 2018 period is attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and our listing on the NASDAQ.\nUpon surrender of our leased properties in Edinburgh in February 2019, we anticipate that the category of expenditures constituting Rent\u201d will decrease significantly.\nWe also expect that the category Marketing expenditures in the fiscal year 2019 will increase to reflect increased marketing efforts on our new generation of products both in the Products and Services Segment.\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Income:\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>3,310,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,818,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 13.3% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in Operating Income in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period is attributed to the increase of our R&D expenditures by 86.3% ($2,571,714 in the 2018 period compared to $1,380,381) for the reasons discussed earlier in conjunction with revenues remaining flat.\nInterest Expense:\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>249,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>597,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 58.3% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis category of expenditures includes interest on the various loans described below.\nIn the 2017 period, we had a Senior Secured Convertible Debenture which attracted 8.5% in interest.

This new HSBC Debenture attracts a more favorable interest rate of 4.56% per annum. In addition, on March 28, 2018 the Company repaid a portion of the new HSBC Debenture thus reducing the principal outstanding amount under this agreement to $1,917,602 at that date.

The amortization schedule for this loan is set out in Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2018 and 2017.\nOur Interest Expense Category also includes interest payable on a loan by our Group CEO to one of our subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc.\nOn a going forward basis, we expect the category of Interest Expense to decrease as on December 2018 we repaid in full the loan to our CEO and the principal amount outstanding on the HSBC Debenture is reducing.\nOther Income:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>41,222 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 66.0% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe make-up of this category is UK Value Added Tax rebates from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and is subject to fluctuations as it usually reflects Value Added Tax rebates (equivalent of the US Sales Tax) from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and changes according to the level of purchases we make outside of the European Union in the period.\nNet Income before Income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31, 2017\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>3,102,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,342,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 7.2% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Income before Income taxes fell largely because revenues remained flat (due to the delays in the Services Segment contracting certain defense contracts) and our increased expenditures in research and development, which increased by 86.3% (from $1,380,381 in the 2017 period to $2,571,714 in the 2018 period).\nNet Income after Income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31, 2017\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4,988,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,339,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 49.4% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Income after Income taxes increased because the Company has recognized and recorded in the 2018 period the full deferred tax asset of $1,754,169 due to management judgement that based on the Company's performance the likelihood of utilizing the Company's Net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) carry forwards has materially increased and therefore the NOLs are realizable in the future.\nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31, 2017\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>4,798,299\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,638,669 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 31.9% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComprehensive Income increased in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period due to the recognition of deferred tax asset (NOLs) in the amount of $1,754,169.

In addition to loss of $190,232 in foreign currency translation (as compared to a gain of $299,006 in the 2017 period), Net Income fell by 32% in the 2018 period largely because revenues remained flat while Research and Development expenditures increased significantly in the 2018 period.\nSince the UK decided to leave the European Union the British pound has been falling significantly against the US dollar (see Note 2 paragraph n of Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for October 31, 2018 and 2017 for fuller information regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy).\nSegment Analysis\nWe are operating in two reportable segments, which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations.

because we restructured our Australian operations in January 2018, whereby most of the sales in this territory are now done by our UK Edinburgh operations. This was done to reduce our overheads associated with sales.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAt October 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $33,748,575, working capital of $14,881,096 and stockholders' equity of $22,632,781. For the period then ended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $2,430,649.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our short- and medium-term liquidity needs. At October 31, 2018, we had cash on hand of approximately $7.5 million and both billed and unbilled receivables of approximately $6.3 million. Our current cash balance represents approximately one-year of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that we incur and reduce those expenses as appropriate.\nOur main liquidity issues are: funding our research and development program ( R&D\u201d) which requires significant expenditures in attracting engineering skills and incurring non-recoverable and non-recurring costs for researching, developing and prototyping products; managing our currency exposure; and servicing our senior secured debentures.\nOur Colmek subsidiary received on or around October 24, 2016 a $1 million loan from the CEO of Coda to fund the purchase of long lead-time inventory (which are typically subject to a lead time of 12-32 weeks) in order to be able to comply with delivery dates for contracts when they are secured. Subsequent to the year end, this loan and associated interest were repaid in full and all obligations under this loan have now been extinguished.\nSubstantially all our properties are owned by the Company and there are no mortgage obligations on those properties.\nWe have a significant concern about adverse currency fluctuations and the effect that those currency fluctuations have on our operations and profitability. As mentioned previously, Brexit has had a significant negative effect on the value of the British pound versus the U. S. dollar. A significant portion of our business is in the United Kingdom and the substantial decrease in the value of the British pound is reflected in lower revenues for our product sales. In addition, all our loans are denominated in U. S. dollars, which means that the dollar value of those loans has effectively gone up since these are partially serviced with British Pounds. While we have chosen not to hedge any of our currency exposure, we continue to evaluate the need to do so and will consider a hedging strategy if and when appropriate.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $4,988,531. We recorded net income for the period of $3,234,362. Other items in uses and sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, which collectively totaled $1,206,907. Changes in operating assets decreased net cash from operating activities by $3,557,023 and changes in current liabilities increased net cash from operating activities by $372,122.\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $637,152 due to the sale and purchase of fixed assets.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $942,382 as a result of paying down the debt of the Company and issuing stock for cash.\nSecured Promissory Note\nOn April 28, 2017, Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d) together with its wholly owned US subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (together, the Subsidiaries\u201d), entered into a loan agreement with HSBC Bank NA (the Lender\u201d) for a loan in the principal amount of $8,000,000 (the Loan\u201d). The annual interest rate is fixed at 4.56%. Commencing on May 28, 2017 and continuing on the 28th day of each month thereafter, the Company was required to make monthly principal and interest payments of $149,350 until April 28, 2022 (making our annual payments under this Note $1,792,200). In addition, within 30 days after the delivery to the Lender of the Company's annual audited consolidated financial statements, the Company was required to make an annual principal payment of $700,000 during the term of the Loan. Such annual payments will reduce the balance of the principal outstanding. As a result, it was expected that the Loan will be repaid within a period of approximately 45 months. The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time subject to a break funding charge as detailed in the promissory note evidencing the Loan.\nThe obligations in connection with the repayment of the Loan are secured by all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the repayment of the Loan is guaranteed by three of the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\nOn or around March 28, 2018, with the consent of the lender, HSBC NA, we reduced our indebtedness under the loan to HSBC significantly (including the annual amounts of $700,000 which was required under the loan) and as of October 31, 2018, the Company is indebted to this lender in the amount of $1,524,239. We did not incur any penalty or costs for the early pre-payments of these amounts. See Note 8 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. We now anticipate that the remaining balance (principal and interest) will be repaid within 41 months from date of loan.\nPrivate Placement\nOn January 29, 2018 ( Transaction Date\u201d), the Company consummated the sale and issuance of 1,125,950 shares of its common stock in a private placement of shares of common stock at $4.40 per share (the Offering\u201d). Total gross proceeds from the Offering were $4,954,180. The purchase price per share was based on a 10% discount of the volume weighted average price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30-consecutive trading-day period ending on January 22, 2018. For a period of 36 months from the Transaction Date, the investors also have the right to purchase, based on their pro-rata ownership of common stock, shares (or securities convertible into shares) offered in subsequent offerings, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nForeign Currency\nThe Company maintains its books in local currency: US Dollars for its US operations, Pounds Sterling for its United Kingdom operations, Norwegian and Danish Kroner for its Norwegian and Danish operations respectively and Australian Dollars for its Australian operations.\nFor the fiscal year ended 2018, 42% of the Company's operations were conducted inside the United States and 58% outside the United States through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly affect the Company's sales, profitability, balance sheet valuations and financial position when the foreign currencies of its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation risks with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although the Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect the Company's business and financial position, there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an adverse impact on the Company's sales, profits, balance sheet valuations and financial position. Because differing portions of our revenues and costs are denominated in foreign currency, movements could impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar strengthens and not correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure. In the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe translation of the Company's UK operations' British Pound denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the British Pound. The average exchange rate during the 2018 period was $1.3420 USD to the GBP against $1.2829 during the 2017 period - an appreciation of the value of the GBP against the USD of 4.6%.\nThe translation of the Company's Australian operations' Australian Dollar denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the Australian Dollar. The average exchange rate during the 2018 period was $0.7534 USD to the AUD against $0.7626 during the 2017 period - a depreciation of the value of the AUD against the USD of 1.2%.\nThe translation of the Company's Danish operation's Danish Kroner (DKK) denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars has been affected by the currency fluctuations of the US dollar against the DKK from an average rate of $0.1535 during the period from March to October 2017, to $0.1590 during the 2018 period - an appreciation of the value of the DKK against the USD of 3.6%.\nThe Company's Norwegian subsidiary is now dormant and the limited activities in that subsidiary is not material for the understanding of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Company's results.

All of these amounts are material to our overall financial results.\nAs a result of Brexit, we expect economic uncertainty to increase until the negotiations for the British exit have been completed and the future relationship between the UK and the EU is fully clarified. This uncertainty will most likely continue to have a profound effect on the value of the British Pound. Since approximately 56% of our revenues are transacted and generated in that British Pound, we expect our revenues to continue to be impacted by the adverse movement of the British Pound against the US Dollar.

Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total services (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as expenditures for direct materials and labor hours are considered to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nSegment Analysis\n\nSince the UK decided to leave the European Union the British pound has been falling significantly against the US dollar (see Note 2 paragraph n of Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for October 31, 2018 and 2017 for fuller information regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy).\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>70.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 3.9 percentage points </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>(gross profit of $12,662,362) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(gross profit of $11,967,725) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in gross margin reflects the different mix of consolidated sales in the 2018 period. In particular, the Products Segment, which generally yields a higher gross profit margin generated more revenues than the Services Segment. Furthermore, the Products Segment's gross profit margin is affected by the mix of outrights sales versus rentals. Rentals also yield a greater gross profit margin than outright sales. Within the mix of sales for the Products Segments there is an increase percentage relating to rentals and sale of newly launched 4G Products.\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>2,571,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,380,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 86.3% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n E.

G. Resourcing Levels Being a small technology company, we are unable to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills as our remuneration package is not as competitive as those offered by bigger companies. \nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $637,152 due to the sale and purchase of fixed assets.\nTable 81: <table> <tr> <td>Expenditure </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Wages and Salaries </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,070,548 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,010,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 23.4% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Legal and Professional Fees (including accounting, audit and investment banking services) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,054,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>934,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase of 12.8% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Rent for our various locations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,728 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 17% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>222,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 43.7 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended October 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percentage Change </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>$ </td> <td>3,102,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,342,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Decrease of 7.2% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract.

subsidiary is not material for the understanding of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Company's results. The Norwegian operations are therefore not included in the below table.\n \n\nRental revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental period.\nThe increase in our R&D expenditure in the 2018 period mainly reflects an increase in our R&D expenditure in the Products Segment.\n 31 \nOn a going forward basis, we expect the category of Interest Expense to decrease as on December 2018 we repaid in full the loan to our CEO and the principal amount outstanding on the HSBC Debenture is reducing.\nThe translation of the Company's UK operations' British Pound denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the British Pound. The average exchange rate during the 2018 period was $1.3420 USD to the GBP against $1.2829 during the 2017 period - an appreciation of the value of the GBP against the USD of 4.6%.\nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These amounts are reflected as liabilities and recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts.\n 24 \nAlthough our Products Segment continues to be affected by the contraction in expenditures in Offshore O&G activities, we have continued to find new markets for our subsea products, mainly our real time 3D sonar series and the launch of our Echoscope4G\u00ae Surface saw an increase in the number of units sold. We also continue to become a key sensor in Offshore Wind Energy where our technology is used for real time 3D visualization of the cable pull in points and cable touch down point. Our increased efforts including expenditures in research and development is designed to capture new markets in the subsea defense space where new technologies such as underwater drones present new challenges for governments. We continue to believe that our real time 3D sonar technology is significant for the subsea defense market which is worth billions annually. Our unique and patented real time 3D solutions are a significant advancement on the current technology available in the subsea sonar imaging market due to its real time capability providing real time volumetric data of underwater targets - both static and moving - in low or zero visibility conditions.\n\nIn the 2017 period, we had a Senior Secured Convertible Debenture which attracted 8.5% in interest. In the 2017 period we repaid this Senior Debenture in full and in the said period paid approximately six months interest payments.\nAt October 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $33,748,575, working capital of $14,881,096 and stockholders' equity of $22,632,781. For the period then ended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $2,430,649.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of a contractual arrangement for this, (2) collection of our fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable.\n\nForeign Currency\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its' carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The Company will early adopt Accounting Standards Codification 2017 - 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which permits the Company to impair the difference between carrying amount in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as the reduction in goodwill. ASC 2017-04 eliminates the requirement in previous GAAP to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nThe effect of inflation on the Company's operating results was not significant during the 2018 period.\nForward-Looking Statements\n H. Investments: We lack the financial resources to advance our flagship technology at the commercially appropriate pace required to capture new markets and increase our sales which could facilitate new entrants to the market. For example, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, a multi-billion company, has recently acquired a number of subsea companies that may speed up their entry into our market. The Company has limited external sources of capital available, and as such is reliant upon its ability to sell its products and services to provide sufficient working capital for its operations and obligations. I. Technological Advancement: A significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our patented real time 3D sonar technology. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can maintain our leading position in the real time 3D imaging sonar market or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our unique capability that we currently supply to subsea market. \n\nThe impact of these currency fluctuations on the 2018 period is shown below:\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\n 27 \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\n \nOur revenue is derived from sales of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services which we provide. Revenue is recognized when evidence of a contractual arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after delivery.\n\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\nOn January 29, 2018 ( Transaction Date\u201d), the Company consummated the sale and issuance of 1,125,950 shares of its common stock in a private placement of shares of common stock at $4.40 per share (the Offering\u201d). Total gross proceeds from the Offering were $4,954,180. The purchase price per share was based on a 10% discount of the volume weighted average price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30-consecutive trading-day period ending on January 22, 2018. For a period of 36 months from the Transaction Date, the investors also have the right to purchase, based on their pro-rata ownership of common stock, shares (or securities convertible into shares) offered in subsequent offerings, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n \nSince introducing this product, we have made progress in getting our core real time 3D technology, the Echoscope\u00ae, adopted by a significant number of ports in the USA (the CodaOctopus\u00ae Underwater Inspection System where it is used for port and harbor security. In 2015 we secured the first sale of our Underwater Inspection System to a foreign government body in East Asia and in 2016 we sold two additional full system to this body.\nIntangible Assets\nPrivate Placement\nOur Services Segment designs and supplies engineering services largely for prime and sub-prime defense contractors.\nOur Services Segment supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d) such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. We have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors and we use these credentials to secure more business. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts (or parts which we are preferred suppliers of) through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\n\nThe information provided below pertains to the consolidated analysis of both segments (Products and Services) operating in our Group.\nOur goal will be to bring more competitively priced and technologically advanced products to the market under a 12-18 months roll out plan. The first of our series of products in our 4G of products was launched in January, 2018, and we expect to launch further products within our 4G/5G series of sonar throughout 2019.\nAs a result of Brexit, we expect economic uncertainty to increase until the negotiations for the British exit have been completed and the future relationship between the UK and the EU is fully clarified. This uncertainty will most likely continue to have a profound effect on the value of the British Pound. Since approximately 56% of our revenues are transacted and generated in that British Pound, we expect our revenues to continue to be impacted by the adverse movement of the British Pound against the US Dollar. We also expect our direct costs of sales for components sourced outside of the UK for our UK operations to increase. Furthermore, our balance sheet will be affected since a significant part of our assets (fixed and current) are held in British Pounds by our UK subsidiaries.\nThe following tables summarize certain balance sheet and statement of operations information by reportable segment for the financial years ending October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDuring the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Services Segment generated 36% and 39% of our total revenues.\nThe translation of the Company's Australian operations' Australian Dollar denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the Australian Dollar. The average exchange rate during the 2018 period was $0.7534 USD to the AUD against $0.7626 during the 2017 period - a depreciation of the value of the AUD against the USD of 1.2%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn or around March 28, 2018, with the consent of the lender, HSBC NA, we reduced our indebtedness under the loan to HSBC significantly (including the annual amounts of $700,000 which was required under the loan) and as of October 31, 2018, the Company is indebted to this lender in the amount of $1,524,239. We did not incur any penalty or costs for the early pre-payments of these amounts. See Note 8 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. We now anticipate that the remaining balance (principal and interest) will be repaid within 41 months from date of loan.\nThe Company's reportable business segments operate in three geographic locations: the United States, Europe and Australia.\nOur Products Segment designs and manufactures products for the subsea market including our range of flagship patented real time 3D sonar solutions ( Products Segment\u201d). These products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major Oil and Gas ( O&G\u201d) companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nOur products and associated services are sold and/or rented to the offshore wind energy, dredging and marine construction, marine and port security, mining including deep sea mining, marine sciences sector and O&G sector. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Product Segment generated 64% and 61% of our total revenues.\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d could,\u201d possibly,\u201d probably,\u201d anticipates,\u201d projects,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d or should\u201d or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nFinancing Activities\n \nIn general, we expect R&D expenditures to continue to increase in the 2019 period for the reasons explained above. Notwithstanding this increase, it is the Company's current belief that it can fund these activities from its operating income.\nNet Income before Income taxes fell largely because revenues remained flat (due to the delays in the Services Segment contracting certain defense contracts) and our increased expenditures in research and development, which increased by 86.3% (from $1,380,381 in the 2017 period to $2,571,714 in the 2018 period).\nAt the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit.\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $4,988,531. We recorded net income for the period of $3,234,362. Other items in uses and sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, which collectively totaled $1,206,907. Changes in operating assets decreased net cash from operating activities by $3,557,023 and changes in current liabilities increased net cash from operating activities by $372,122.\nSee Segment information below for a full breakout of the financial performance of each Segment for the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively.\nThe increase in our Legal and Professional Fees in the 2018 period is attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and our listing on the NASDAQ.\nWe have also made progress in expanding the markets (and applications) for our real time 3D sonars. Recently, we have sold a number of systems to mining companies. Increasingly, our customers involved in offshore wind energy and renewables are adopting the technology as the primary tool for scour management, subsea cable installation and associated cable protection tasks.\nOur products are complex and, despite the increase in our R&D expenditures, we can give no assurance that we will realize our stated goals. We may incur significant R&D expenditures without realizing any commercially viable products or there may be glitches with our product launch.\nR&D expenditures in the Services Segment were $523,429 in the 2018 period compared to $460,518 in the 2017 period, an increase of 13.7%. These expenditures are in line with our budgetary plans as we are investing significantly in the refreshing the Thermite\u00ae range of products which is a significant part of our growth strategy (Services Segment). The Thermite\u00ae is a product which we acquired from Quantum 3D in 2014 and it has a prestigious customer base. We believe that the technically refreshed Thermite presents a substantial opportunity to grow this part of our business and we have now completed the first development of the new Thermite\u00ae Octal and have received the first orders from 2 significant customers for trial versions. Thermite\u00ae enjoys a prestigious existing customer base which we intend to re-engage with this new Thermite\u00ae Octal.\nResults of operations for our Products Segment are impacted by the offshore drilling season. During the winter months, when less offshore drilling takes place, demand for our oil and gas related technology is typically at its lowest.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our short- and medium-term liquidity needs. At October 31, 2018, we had cash on hand of approximately $7.5 million and both billed and unbilled receivables of approximately $6.3 million. Our current cash balance represents approximately one-year of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that we incur and reduce those expenses as appropriate.\nThese are the values that have been used in the calculations below.\nIn the 2018 period, interest is attributed to the HSBC Loan and a loan made by our CEO to one of our subsidiaries.\n\nThe obligations in connection with the repayment of the Loan are secured by all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the repayment of the Loan is guaranteed by three of the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\nOur Colmek subsidiary received on or around October 24, 2016 a $1 million loan from the CEO of Coda to fund the purchase of long lead-time inventory (which are typically subject to a lead time of 12-32 weeks) in order to be able to comply with delivery dates for contracts when they are secured. Subsequent to the year end, this loan and associated interest were repaid in full and all obligations under this loan have now been extinguished.\nInterest Expense:\nThe Services Segment has now contracted backlog orders in the amount of $2,504,380 in respect of 2017 and 2018 and we expect the further outstanding backlog to be contracted in the first half of 2019. This Segment currently has an order book of $7.2m.\nOn November 1, 2018 the Company will adopt Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). While terminology and requirements change in ASC 606, we believe that our existing revenue accounting is compliant with ASC 606 and that our accounting for revenue will not change. Accordingly, our disclosures about our revenue in accordance with ASC 606 will expand to comply with the new requirements, including expansion of quarterly revenue reporting requirements.\nResearch and Development (R&D):\nSubstantially all our properties are owned by the Company and there are no mortgage obligations on those properties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\nRevenue:\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue by allocating the total consideration to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable. Revenue from equipment and software sales are recognized when delivered, and revenue for installation and other services are recognized as they are performed.\n \nThe Company maintains its books in local currency: US Dollars for its US operations, Pounds Sterling for its United Kingdom operations, Norwegian and Danish Kroner for its Norwegian and Danish operations respectively and Australian Dollars for its Australian operations.\nGeneral Overview\n 33 \n\nInflation\n\n\nThis category of expenditures includes interest on the various loans described below.\nOperating Activities\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Services Segment has now started to receive the backlog orders that were due in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and have now contracted a backlog of $2,504,380 (for the 2017/2018 orders) and we expect the further outstanding backlog to be contracted in the first half of 2019. Our biggest risks for the 2019 fiscal year for this Segment is that of timely execution of its mounting backlog of orders. The current level of this Segment's order book is approximately $7.2m.\nWe suffered a small decrease in revenues in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period. This is largely due to the Services Segment not achieving its revenue plan for fiscal year 2018 because of the delay in securing anticipated annual defense contracts resulting from the delay in the US Administration approving its defense budget. During the fiscal year ended 2018, the Products Segment generated revenues of $11,499,416 and Services Segment $6,570,013. During the 2018 period the Products Segment revenues grew by 4.2% over the 2017 period and the Services Segment revenues declined by 6.7% over the said period.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 ( 2018 period\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 ( 2017 period\u201d)\n \nSeasonality\nAlthough there is a modest decrease in Wages and Salaries category of expenditures, we would expect that in the 2019 fiscal year this category will increase to reflect the investments we are making in our business including in the area of sales and marketing and quality control.\n 22 \nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31, 2017\nInvesting Activities\n A. United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) including the possibility that such withdrawal will take place without a deal on their future relationship ( No Deal Brexit Issue\u201d) We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from our UK operations (both Coda Octopus Products Limited and Coda Octopus Martech). Following a national referendum, the United Kingdom Government has served notice to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The date of the UK leaving the European Union and the deadline for concluding a deal is currently March 29, 2019. Failing to conclude a deal could result in a No Deal Brexit or the UK Parliament intervening and seeking an extension on the March 29, 2019 date. A No Deal Brexit could affect our UK operations which represents a significant part of our earnings (Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh-based) and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (Portland, England-based). The ongoing uncertainty also impacts the British Pound (which is the trading currency of our UK operations). This has adverse impact on revenues reported (due to depreciation of the British Pound against other major currencies including the US Dollar) and devaluation of our consolidated balance sheet assets. Because there is no precedent for a European Union member state leaving the Union, the full implications for the Company are not clear. The outcome is dependent on the type of future relationship that is struck between the United Kingdom and the European Union. In a worst-case scenario, where no deal on the future of the UK relationship with European Union is struck, it is widely believed that the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules will apply. Operating on this basis would have far-reaching implications for our Company particularly in the area of costs associated with import/export arrangements for our products including custom duties on purchases and sales and delays and increased compliance costs in the supply chain (both purchasing and selling). We currently benefit from mutual recognition rules in a number of areas including export control requirements and quality standards which allow us to distribute our products freely in European Union. If these are removed it is likely to involve new qualifications requirements that we would need to meet with the attendant costs and delays involved. Furthermore, if free movement is restricted this will also limit our ability to utilize our trained engineers and experts on customer projects in the European Union. Furthermore, if the UK were to have an unplanned withdrawal this would compound the issues for our Company further as it is commonly believed that there would be resulting chaos and uncertainty, which would adversely affect the Company. It is also widely believed that in a worst-case scenario, the British Pound will be exposed to extreme exchange rate fluctuations between the major currencies including US Dollar and Euro. Many companies are seeking to mitigate the impact by seeking certain trading licenses in European Union member state countries. In anticipation of a No Deal Brexit, we are taking steps to mitigate this and have established a company, Coda Octopus Products A/S, in Denmark to maintain a presence in the European Union and to address the foreseeable issues. However, we can give no assurance that this in itself would be sufficient to address the impact of both a No Deal Brexit and an unplanned No Deal Brexit (i.e. crashing out of the European Union). B. Currency Risks: The Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Denmark. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 58%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (56% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d). In addition, a significant part of our assets (both current and fixed) are held in British Pounds by our foreign subsidiaries. The depreciation of the British Pound against major currencies adversely impacts our revenues as a whole which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures - see Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements) are maintained in U.S. Dollars. In the 2018 period as compared to the same 2017 period, we realized a consolidated balance sheet loss on our assets due to the weakening of the British Pound against the US Dollar prevailing at October 31, 2018. In fiscal year 2018 compared to the 2017 period, we incurred a loss on our exchange rate translations in respect of our comprehensive income and loss account. See Note 2, paragraph n, of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2018 and 2017 regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy. This currency risk is further exacerbated by the uncertainty around Brexit. C. Trade Disputes: The costs of our raw materials could become a serious concern due to inter-country trade disputes. Our US Services Segment has suffered increased cost of raw materials sourced within the United States due to ongoing trade dispute between the USA, China and Canada. D. Price of Commodities: The price of commodities, in particular O&G. The decline in O&G prices since 2014 with a partial recovery since 2016 has resulted in large scale reductions in capital and operational expenditures, which directly impact on the Products Segment by reducing the quantity of sales and rentals into O&G and related markets. O&G has remained very competitive and customers are increasingly seeking significant discounts to place orders. \nThe Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon operating income. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nInformation concerning principal geographic areas is presented below according to the area where the activity is taking place for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively:\nThe reason for the decline in our Australia revenues is because we restructured our Australian operations in January 2018, whereby most of the sales in this territory are now done by our UK Edinburgh operations. This was done to reduce our overheads associated with sales.\nThe decrease in Operating Income in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period is attributed to the increase of our R&D expenditures by 86.3% ($2,571,714 in the 2018 period compared to $1,380,381) for the reasons discussed earlier in conjunction with revenues remaining flat.\nOther Income:\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nFiscal Year 2018 Consolidated Results of Operations\nIn recent years, the Products and Services Segment have each generated 50% of our revenues. As a general rule, however, the Product Segment yields a higher Gross Profit Margin than the Services Segment. In both 2017 and 2018 fiscal years the Services Segment revenues and Net Income were substantially down and off plan due to the failure of new US Administration to pass a defense budget. This impact continued in 2018 on the Services Segment. In 2018 fiscal year therefore, Products Segment generated 64% of the Company's consolidated revenues and the Services Segment generated 36%. We consider this to be atypical and would anticipate in 2019 fiscal year Services Segment revenues will be more in line with 50% of our overall revenues.\n 25 \nIn addition, in recent years we have started to rent our real time 3D solutions with engineering services. Given the contraction in capital expenditures budget in the O&G market, rentals are increasingly becoming an important part of the composition of the Company's revenues and these O&G operators are more prepared to utilize operational budgets. Furthermore, our rental offering generally yields a higher gross margin for the Company.\nUpon surrender of our leased properties in Edinburgh in February 2019, we anticipate that the category of expenditures constituting Rent\u201d will decrease significantly.\nIncome Taxes\nOperating Income:\nThere are a number of reasons for the decline of our Comprehensive Income. In addition to loss of $190,232 in foreign currency translation (as compared to a gain of $299,006 in the 2017 period), Net Income fell by 32% in the 2018 period largely because revenues remained flat while Research and Development expenditures increased significantly in the 2018 period.\nDuring the 2018 period, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $2,882,761 or 16% of net revenues during the period. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2018 was $24,993 or 1% of accounts receivable.\n 26 \n \nFor the fiscal year ended 2018, 42% of the Company's operations were conducted inside the United States and 58% outside the United States through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly affect the Company's sales, profitability, balance sheet valuations and financial position when the foreign currencies of its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation risks with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although the Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect the Company's business and financial position, there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an adverse impact on the Company's sales, profits, balance sheet valuations and financial position. Because differing portions of our revenues and costs are denominated in foreign currency, movements could impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar strengthens and not correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure. In the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nOn April 28, 2017, Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d) together with its wholly owned US subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (together, the Subsidiaries\u201d), entered into a loan agreement with HSBC Bank NA (the Lender\u201d) for a loan in the principal amount of $8,000,000 (the Loan\u201d). The annual interest rate is fixed at 4.56%. Commencing on May 28, 2017 and continuing on the 28th day of each month thereafter, the Company was required to make monthly principal and interest payments of $149,350 until April 28, 2022 (making our annual payments under this Note $1,792,200). In addition, within 30 days after the delivery to the Lender of the Company's annual audited consolidated financial statements, the Company was required to make an annual principal payment of $700,000 during the term of the Loan. Such annual payments will reduce the balance of the principal outstanding. As a result, it was expected that the Loan will be repaid within a period of approximately 45 months. The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time subject to a break funding charge as detailed in the promissory note evidencing the Loan.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A):\n 23 \nThis table shows that the effect of constant exchange rates, versus the actual exchange rate fluctuations, increased net income for the year by $119,634 and decreased net assets by $513,980. All of these amounts are material to our overall financial results.\nWe defer costs on projects for service revenue. Deferred costs consist primarily of direct and incremental costs to customize and install systems, as defined in individual customer contracts, including costs to acquire hardware and software from third parties and payroll costs for our employees and other third parties.\nGross Margin:\nSecured Promissory Note", "item_7_text": "Our main liquidity issues are: funding our research and development program ( R&D\u201d) which requires significant expenditures in attracting engineering skills and incurring non-recoverable and non-recurring costs for researching, developing and prototyping products; managing our currency exposure; and servicing our senior secured debentures.\n\n \nThe translation of the Company's Danish operation's Danish Kroner (DKK) denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars has been affected by the currency fluctuations of the US dollar against the DKK from an average rate of $0.1535 during the period from March to October 2017, to $0.1590 during the 2018 period - an appreciation of the value of the DKK against the USD of 3.6%.\n 32 \nComprehensive Income increased in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period due to the recognition of deferred tax asset (NOLs) in the amount of $1,754,169. Without this inclusion Comprehensive Income fell by 16.3% in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period.\nWe also expect that the category Marketing expenditures in the fiscal year 2019 will increase to reflect increased marketing efforts on our new generation of products both in the Products and Services Segment.\nWe operate two distinct business segments. Our Marine Technology Business designs, manufactures, sells and rents patented real time 3D sonar solutions and other leading products to the subsea market ( Products Segment\u201d). Our Marine Engineering Business supplies engineering services (from design, prototyping to manufacturing) to mainly prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d).\nThere are inter-segment sales in the table below which have been eliminated from our financial statements. However, for the purpose of segment reporting, these are included in the table below only.\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $942,382 as a result of paying down the debt of the Company and issuing stock for cash.\n\n\nThe make-up of this category is UK Value Added Tax rebates from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and is subject to fluctuations as it usually reflects Value Added Tax rebates (equivalent of the US Sales Tax) from purchases made outside of the European Union by our UK operations and changes according to the level of purchases we make outside of the European Union in the period.\nWe have a significant concern about adverse currency fluctuations and the effect that those currency fluctuations have on our operations and profitability. As mentioned previously, Brexit has had a significant negative effect on the value of the British pound versus the U. S. dollar. A significant portion of our business is in the United Kingdom and the substantial decrease in the value of the British pound is reflected in lower revenues for our product sales. In addition, all our loans are denominated in U. S. dollars, which means that the dollar value of those loans has effectively gone up since these are partially serviced with British Pounds. While we have chosen not to hedge any of our currency exposure, we continue to evaluate the need to do so and will consider a hedging strategy if and when appropriate.\nOn or around April 28, 2017, we entered into a new Senior Secured Debenture with HSBC NA where we borrowed $8,000,000, the proceeds of which were used to repay the Senior Secured Convertible described above. This new HSBC Debenture attracts a more favorable interest rate of 4.56% per annum. In addition, on March 28, 2018 the Company repaid a portion of the new HSBC Debenture thus reducing the principal outstanding amount under this agreement to $1,917,602 at that date. As at October 31, 2018, the amount outstanding under the HSBC Debenture is $1,524,239. The amortization schedule for this loan is set out in Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of October 31, 2018 and 2017.\n \nR&D expenditures in the Products Segment increased by 122.7% from $919,863 in the 2017 period to $2,048,285 in the 2018 period. This increase is in line with our budgetary plans and is a reflection of the increased activities in developing our 4G/5G of products.\nNet Income after Income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31, 2017\n 28 \n 29 \nOur Interest Expense Category also includes interest payable on a loan by our Group CEO to one of our subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc.\nWe are operating in two reportable segments, which are managed separately based upon fundamental differences in their operations. Segment operating income is total segment revenue reduced by operating expenses identifiable with the business segment. Overhead includes general corporate administrative costs.\n 30 \nKey Areas of SG&A Expenditure across the Group for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31,\nThe increase in our SG&A expenditures in the 2018 period is broadly attributed to the increased costs associated with legal and transaction costs pertaining to a private placement consummated in January 2018. In fiscal year 2019, we do not anticipate this category of expenditure to increase as in fiscal year 2018 we incurred non-recurring one-off costs associated with re-organization of our Company to finance our R&D efforts. Approximately $586,436 of the increased amount in our SG&A expenditures constitutes non-recurring costs attributed to employees' separation payments and a further $90,000 associated with surrendering leased business property in Edinburgh.\nWe recognize the expense related to the fair value of stock based compensation awards within the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income. We use the fair value method for equity instruments granted to non-employees and use the Black-Scholes model for measuring the fair value. The stock based fair value compensation is determined as of the date of the grant or the date at which the performance of the services is completed (measurement date) and is recognized over the periods in which the related services are rendered.\nWe operate two distinct business segments: Products Segment and Services Segment\nNet Income after Income taxes increased because the Company has recognized and recorded in the 2018 period the full deferred tax asset of $1,754,169 due to management judgement that based on the Company's performance the likelihood of utilizing the Company's Net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) carry forwards has materially increased and therefore the NOLs are realizable in the future.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor arrangements that are generated from time and material contracts where there is a signed agreement and approved purchase order in place that specifies the fixed hourly rate and other reimbursable costs to be billed based on material and direct labor hours incurred, revenue is recognized on these contracts based on material and direct labor hours incurred. Revenues from fixed-price contracts are recognized on the percentage-of-completion method, measured by the percentage of costs incurred (materials and direct labor hours) to date to estimated total services (materials and direct labor hours) for each contract. This method is used as expenditures for direct materials and labor hours are considered to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts. Losses on fixed-price contracts are recognized during the period in which the loss first becomes apparent based upon costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete as determined by experience from similar contracts. Variations from estimated contract performance could result in adjustments to operating results.\nSegment Analysis\n\nSince the UK decided to leave the European Union the British pound has been falling significantly against the US dollar (see Note 2 paragraph n of Notes to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements for October 31, 2018 and 2017 for fuller information regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy).\nThe increase in gross margin reflects the different mix of consolidated sales in the 2018 period. In particular, the Products Segment, which generally yields a higher gross profit margin generated more revenues than the Services Segment. Furthermore, the Products Segment's gross profit margin is affected by the mix of outrights sales versus rentals. Rentals also yield a greater gross profit margin than outright sales. Within the mix of sales for the Products Segments there is an increase percentage relating to rentals and sale of newly launched 4G Products.\n E. Government Spending for Defense: The allocation of funds to defense procurement by governments in the United States and the United Kingdom F. Political Landscape: Global-political uncertainties affecting the markets into which we sell our goods and services. Global trends which make certain geographical regions more competitive in providing engineering solutions because of lower labor costs (e.g. India and China) are likely to affect our Services Segments (which provides engineering services). G. Resourcing Levels Being a small technology company, we are unable to compete for certain specialized electronic engineering skills as our remuneration package is not as competitive as those offered by bigger companies. \nNet cash used by investing activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $637,152 due to the sale and purchase of fixed assets.\n\nWe recognize such costs in accordance with our revenue recognition policy by contract. For revenue recognized under the completed contract method, costs are deferred until the products are delivered, or upon completion of services or, where applicable, customer acceptance. For revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method, costs are recognized as products are delivered or services are provided in accordance with the percentage of completion calculation. For revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract, costs are recognized ratably over the term of the contract, commencing on the date of revenue recognition. At each balance sheet date, we review deferred costs, to ensure they are ultimately recoverable. Any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized when evidence indicates the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue.\n \nStock Based Compensation\nNet Income before Income taxes for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31, 2017\n \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Company's Norwegian subsidiary is now dormant and the limited activities in that subsidiary is not material for the understanding of the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on Company's results. The Norwegian operations are therefore not included in the below table.\n \n\nRental revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental period.\nThe increase in our R&D expenditure in the 2018 period mainly reflects an increase in our R&D expenditure in the Products Segment.\n 31 \nOn a going forward basis, we expect the category of Interest Expense to decrease as on December 2018 we repaid in full the loan to our CEO and the principal amount outstanding on the HSBC Debenture is reducing.\nThe translation of the Company's UK operations' British Pound denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the British Pound. The average exchange rate during the 2018 period was $1.3420 USD to the GBP against $1.2829 during the 2017 period - an appreciation of the value of the GBP against the USD of 4.6%.\nOur contracts sometimes require customer payments in advance of revenue recognition. These amounts are reflected as liabilities and recognized as revenue when the Company has fulfilled its obligations under the respective contracts.\n 24 \nAlthough our Products Segment continues to be affected by the contraction in expenditures in Offshore O&G activities, we have continued to find new markets for our subsea products, mainly our real time 3D sonar series and the launch of our Echoscope4G\u00ae Surface saw an increase in the number of units sold. We also continue to become a key sensor in Offshore Wind Energy where our technology is used for real time 3D visualization of the cable pull in points and cable touch down point. Our increased efforts including expenditures in research and development is designed to capture new markets in the subsea defense space where new technologies such as underwater drones present new challenges for governments. We continue to believe that our real time 3D sonar technology is significant for the subsea defense market which is worth billions annually. Our unique and patented real time 3D solutions are a significant advancement on the current technology available in the subsea sonar imaging market due to its real time capability providing real time volumetric data of underwater targets - both static and moving - in low or zero visibility conditions.\n\nIn the 2017 period, we had a Senior Secured Convertible Debenture which attracted 8.5% in interest. In the 2017 period we repaid this Senior Debenture in full and in the said period paid approximately six months interest payments.\nAt October 31, 2018, the Company had an accumulated deficit of $33,748,575, working capital of $14,881,096 and stockholders' equity of $22,632,781. For the period then ended, the Company generated cash flow from operations of $2,430,649.\nFor software license sales for which any services rendered are not considered essential to the functionality of the software, we recognize revenue upon delivery of the software, provided (1) there is evidence of a contractual arrangement for this, (2) collection of our fee is considered probable and (3) the fee is fixed and determinable.\n\nForeign Currency\nThe first step of the goodwill impairment test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its' carrying amount, including goodwill. If the fair value, which is based on future cash flows, exceeds the carrying amount, goodwill is not considered impaired. If the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, the second step must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss, if any. The Company will early adopt Accounting Standards Codification 2017 - 04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, which permits the Company to impair the difference between carrying amount in excess of the fair value of the reporting unit as the reduction in goodwill. ASC 2017-04 eliminates the requirement in previous GAAP to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test.\nThe effect of inflation on the Company's operating results was not significant during the 2018 period.\nForward-Looking Statements\n H. Investments: We lack the financial resources to advance our flagship technology at the commercially appropriate pace required to capture new markets and increase our sales which could facilitate new entrants to the market. For example, Teledyne Technologies Incorporated, a multi-billion company, has recently acquired a number of subsea companies that may speed up their entry into our market. The Company has limited external sources of capital available, and as such is reliant upon its ability to sell its products and services to provide sufficient working capital for its operations and obligations. I. Technological Advancement: A significant part of our growth strategy is predicated on our patented real time 3D sonar technology. The technology space is inherently uncertain due to the fast pace of innovations and therefore we can give no assurance that we can maintain our leading position in the real time 3D imaging sonar market or that innovations in other areas may not surpass our unique capability that we currently supply to subsea market. \n\nThe impact of these currency fluctuations on the 2018 period is shown below:\nThe Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740, Income Taxes (ASC 740). Under ASC 740, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the income tax effects of differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their bases for income tax reporting. The Company's differences arise principally from the use of various accelerated and modified accelerated cost recovery system for income tax purposes versus straight line depreciation used for book purposes and from the utilization of net operating loss carry-forwards.\n 27 \nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OPERATIONS\n \nOur revenue is derived from sales of underwater technologies and equipment for imaging, mapping, defense and survey applications and from the engineering services which we provide. Revenue is recognized when evidence of a contractual arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, the contract price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. No right of return privileges are granted to customers after delivery.\n\nOur business is affected by a number of factors including those set out below:\nOn January 29, 2018 ( Transaction Date\u201d), the Company consummated the sale and issuance of 1,125,950 shares of its common stock in a private placement of shares of common stock at $4.40 per share (the Offering\u201d). Total gross proceeds from the Offering were $4,954,180. The purchase price per share was based on a 10% discount of the volume weighted average price of the common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market for the 30-consecutive trading-day period ending on January 22, 2018. For a period of 36 months from the Transaction Date, the investors also have the right to purchase, based on their pro-rata ownership of common stock, shares (or securities convertible into shares) offered in subsequent offerings, subject to certain limited exceptions.\n \nSince introducing this product, we have made progress in getting our core real time 3D technology, the Echoscope\u00ae, adopted by a significant number of ports in the USA (the CodaOctopus\u00ae Underwater Inspection System where it is used for port and harbor security. In 2015 we secured the first sale of our Underwater Inspection System to a foreign government body in East Asia and in 2016 we sold two additional full system to this body.\nIntangible Assets\nPrivate Placement\nOur Services Segment designs and supplies engineering services largely for prime and sub-prime defense contractors.\nOur Services Segment supplies engineering services to prime defense contractors ( Services Segment\u201d) such as Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. We have long-standing relationships with prime defense contractors and we use these credentials to secure more business. We support some significant defense programs by supplying and maintaining proprietary parts (or parts which we are preferred suppliers of) through obsolescence management programs. These services provide recurring stream of revenues for our Services segment.\n\nThe information provided below pertains to the consolidated analysis of both segments (Products and Services) operating in our Group.\nOur goal will be to bring more competitively priced and technologically advanced products to the market under a 12-18 months roll out plan. The first of our series of products in our 4G of products was launched in January, 2018, and we expect to launch further products within our 4G/5G series of sonar throughout 2019.\nAs a result of Brexit, we expect economic uncertainty to increase until the negotiations for the British exit have been completed and the future relationship between the UK and the EU is fully clarified. This uncertainty will most likely continue to have a profound effect on the value of the British Pound. Since approximately 56% of our revenues are transacted and generated in that British Pound, we expect our revenues to continue to be impacted by the adverse movement of the British Pound against the US Dollar. We also expect our direct costs of sales for components sourced outside of the UK for our UK operations to increase. Furthermore, our balance sheet will be affected since a significant part of our assets (fixed and current) are held in British Pounds by our UK subsidiaries.\nThe following tables summarize certain balance sheet and statement of operations information by reportable segment for the financial years ending October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nDuring the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Services Segment generated 36% and 39% of our total revenues.\nThe translation of the Company's Australian operations' Australian Dollar denominated balance sheets and results of operations into US dollars was affected by changes in the average value of the US dollar against the Australian Dollar. The average exchange rate during the 2018 period was $0.7534 USD to the AUD against $0.7626 during the 2017 period - a depreciation of the value of the AUD against the USD of 1.2%.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOn or around March 28, 2018, with the consent of the lender, HSBC NA, we reduced our indebtedness under the loan to HSBC significantly (including the annual amounts of $700,000 which was required under the loan) and as of October 31, 2018, the Company is indebted to this lender in the amount of $1,524,239. We did not incur any penalty or costs for the early pre-payments of these amounts. See Note 8 to the audited Consolidated Financial Statements For the Years Ended October 31, 2018 and 2017. We now anticipate that the remaining balance (principal and interest) will be repaid within 41 months from date of loan.\nThe Company's reportable business segments operate in three geographic locations: the United States, Europe and Australia.\nOur Products Segment designs and manufactures products for the subsea market including our range of flagship patented real time 3D sonar solutions ( Products Segment\u201d). These products are used primarily in the underwater construction market, offshore oil and gas, offshore wind energy industry, and in the complex dredging, port security, mining and marine sciences sectors. Our customers include service providers to major Oil and Gas ( O&G\u201d) companies, law enforcement agencies, ports, mining companies, defense bodies, research institutes and universities.\nBelow is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results and that may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 2, Summary of Accounting Policies\u201d of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n \nOur products and associated services are sold and/or rented to the offshore wind energy, dredging and marine construction, marine and port security, mining including deep sea mining, marine sciences sector and O&G sector. During the fiscal years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, the Product Segment generated 64% and 61% of our total revenues.\nFor income tax purposes, the Company uses the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues on long-term contracts which is consistent with the Company's financial reporting under U.S. GAAP.\nThe information herein contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical fact made herein are forward looking. In particular, the statements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations or financial position are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d could,\u201d possibly,\u201d probably,\u201d anticipates,\u201d projects,\u201d expects,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d or should\u201d or other variations or similar words. No assurances can be given that the future results anticipated by the forward-looking statements will be achieved. Forward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Our actual results may differ significantly from management's expectations.\nFinancing Activities\n \nIn general, we expect R&D expenditures to continue to increase in the 2019 period for the reasons explained above. Notwithstanding this increase, it is the Company's current belief that it can fund these activities from its operating income.\nNet Income before Income taxes fell largely because revenues remained flat (due to the delays in the Services Segment contracting certain defense contracts) and our increased expenditures in research and development, which increased by 86.3% (from $1,380,381 in the 2017 period to $2,571,714 in the 2018 period).\nAt the end of each year, we evaluate goodwill on a separate reporting unit basis to assess recoverability, and impairments, if any, are recognized in earnings. An impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the goodwill over the fair value of the reporting unit.\nWe do not have any off balance sheet arrangements.\nNet cash generated from operating activities for the year ended October 31, 2018 was $4,988,531. We recorded net income for the period of $3,234,362. Other items in uses and sources of funds from operations included non-cash charges related to depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, which collectively totaled $1,206,907. Changes in operating assets decreased net cash from operating activities by $3,557,023 and changes in current liabilities increased net cash from operating activities by $372,122.\nSee Segment information below for a full breakout of the financial performance of each Segment for the 2018 and 2017 periods, respectively.\nThe increase in our Legal and Professional Fees in the 2018 period is attributed to the increased costs associated with becoming a SEC reporting company and our listing on the NASDAQ.\nWe have also made progress in expanding the markets (and applications) for our real time 3D sonars. Recently, we have sold a number of systems to mining companies. Increasingly, our customers involved in offshore wind energy and renewables are adopting the technology as the primary tool for scour management, subsea cable installation and associated cable protection tasks.\nOur products are complex and, despite the increase in our R&D expenditures, we can give no assurance that we will realize our stated goals. We may incur significant R&D expenditures without realizing any commercially viable products or there may be glitches with our product launch.\nR&D expenditures in the Services Segment were $523,429 in the 2018 period compared to $460,518 in the 2017 period, an increase of 13.7%. These expenditures are in line with our budgetary plans as we are investing significantly in the refreshing the Thermite\u00ae range of products which is a significant part of our growth strategy (Services Segment). The Thermite\u00ae is a product which we acquired from Quantum 3D in 2014 and it has a prestigious customer base. We believe that the technically refreshed Thermite presents a substantial opportunity to grow this part of our business and we have now completed the first development of the new Thermite\u00ae Octal and have received the first orders from 2 significant customers for trial versions. Thermite\u00ae enjoys a prestigious existing customer base which we intend to re-engage with this new Thermite\u00ae Octal.\nResults of operations for our Products Segment are impacted by the offshore drilling season. During the winter months, when less offshore drilling takes place, demand for our oil and gas related technology is typically at its lowest.\nWe believe that our current level of cash and cash generation will be sufficient to meet our short- and medium-term liquidity needs. At October 31, 2018, we had cash on hand of approximately $7.5 million and both billed and unbilled receivables of approximately $6.3 million. Our current cash balance represents approximately one-year of Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Company continues to critically evaluate the level of expenses that we incur and reduce those expenses as appropriate.\nThese are the values that have been used in the calculations below.\nIn the 2018 period, interest is attributed to the HSBC Loan and a loan made by our CEO to one of our subsidiaries.\n\nThe obligations in connection with the repayment of the Loan are secured by all assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries. In addition, the repayment of the Loan is guaranteed by three of the Company's overseas subsidiaries.\nOur Colmek subsidiary received on or around October 24, 2016 a $1 million loan from the CEO of Coda to fund the purchase of long lead-time inventory (which are typically subject to a lead time of 12-32 weeks) in order to be able to comply with delivery dates for contracts when they are secured. Subsequent to the year end, this loan and associated interest were repaid in full and all obligations under this loan have now been extinguished.\nInterest Expense:\nThe Services Segment has now contracted backlog orders in the amount of $2,504,380 in respect of 2017 and 2018 and we expect the further outstanding backlog to be contracted in the first half of 2019. This Segment currently has an order book of $7.2m.\nOn November 1, 2018 the Company will adopt Accounting Standards Codification ASC 606, Revenue From Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). While terminology and requirements change in ASC 606, we believe that our existing revenue accounting is compliant with ASC 606 and that our accounting for revenue will not change. Accordingly, our disclosures about our revenue in accordance with ASC 606 will expand to comply with the new requirements, including expansion of quarterly revenue reporting requirements.\nResearch and Development (R&D):\nSubstantially all our properties are owned by the Company and there are no mortgage obligations on those properties.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are the amounts by which the Company's future income taxes are expected to be impacted by these differences as they reverse. Deferred tax assets are based on differences that are expected to decrease future income taxes as they reverse. Correspondingly, deferred tax liabilities are based on differences that are expected to increase future income taxes as they reverse. Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements discusses the amounts of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and also presents the impact of significant differences between financial reporting income and taxable income.\nRevenue:\nFor arrangements with multiple deliverables, we recognize revenue by allocating the total consideration to each deliverable based on the relative fair value of each deliverable. Revenue from equipment and software sales are recognized when delivered, and revenue for installation and other services are recognized as they are performed.\n \nThe Company maintains its books in local currency: US Dollars for its US operations, Pounds Sterling for its United Kingdom operations, Norwegian and Danish Kroner for its Norwegian and Danish operations respectively and Australian Dollars for its Australian operations.\nGeneral Overview\n 33 \n\nInflation\n\n\nThis category of expenditures includes interest on the various loans described below.\nOperating Activities\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements, included herewith. This discussion should not be construed to imply that the results discussed herein will necessarily continue into the future, or that any conclusion reached herein will necessarily be indicative of actual operating results in the future. Such discussion represents only the best present assessment of our management.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe Services Segment has now started to receive the backlog orders that were due in both fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and have now contracted a backlog of $2,504,380 (for the 2017/2018 orders) and we expect the further outstanding backlog to be contracted in the first half of 2019. Our biggest risks for the 2019 fiscal year for this Segment is that of timely execution of its mounting backlog of orders. The current level of this Segment's order book is approximately $7.2m.\nWe suffered a small decrease in revenues in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period. This is largely due to the Services Segment not achieving its revenue plan for fiscal year 2018 because of the delay in securing anticipated annual defense contracts resulting from the delay in the US Administration approving its defense budget. During the fiscal year ended 2018, the Products Segment generated revenues of $11,499,416 and Services Segment $6,570,013. During the 2018 period the Products Segment revenues grew by 4.2% over the 2017 period and the Services Segment revenues declined by 6.7% over the said period.\nComparison of fiscal year ended October 31, 2018 ( 2018 period\u201d) to fiscal year ended October 31, 2017 ( 2017 period\u201d)\n \nSeasonality\nAlthough there is a modest decrease in Wages and Salaries category of expenditures, we would expect that in the 2019 fiscal year this category will increase to reflect the investments we are making in our business including in the area of sales and marketing and quality control.\n 22 \nComprehensive Income for the year ended October 31, 2018 compared to the year ended October 31, 2017\nInvesting Activities\n A. United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union ( Brexit\u201d) including the possibility that such withdrawal will take place without a deal on their future relationship ( No Deal Brexit Issue\u201d) We derive a significant portion of our net operating revenues from our UK operations (both Coda Octopus Products Limited and Coda Octopus Martech). Following a national referendum, the United Kingdom Government has served notice to leave the European Union under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The date of the UK leaving the European Union and the deadline for concluding a deal is currently March 29, 2019. Failing to conclude a deal could result in a No Deal Brexit or the UK Parliament intervening and seeking an extension on the March 29, 2019 date. A No Deal Brexit could affect our UK operations which represents a significant part of our earnings (Coda Octopus Products Limited (Edinburgh-based) and Coda Octopus Martech Limited (Portland, England-based). The ongoing uncertainty also impacts the British Pound (which is the trading currency of our UK operations). This has adverse impact on revenues reported (due to depreciation of the British Pound against other major currencies including the US Dollar) and devaluation of our consolidated balance sheet assets. Because there is no precedent for a European Union member state leaving the Union, the full implications for the Company are not clear. The outcome is dependent on the type of future relationship that is struck between the United Kingdom and the European Union. In a worst-case scenario, where no deal on the future of the UK relationship with European Union is struck, it is widely believed that the World Trade Organization (WTO) rules will apply. Operating on this basis would have far-reaching implications for our Company particularly in the area of costs associated with import/export arrangements for our products including custom duties on purchases and sales and delays and increased compliance costs in the supply chain (both purchasing and selling). We currently benefit from mutual recognition rules in a number of areas including export control requirements and quality standards which allow us to distribute our products freely in European Union. If these are removed it is likely to involve new qualifications requirements that we would need to meet with the attendant costs and delays involved. Furthermore, if free movement is restricted this will also limit our ability to utilize our trained engineers and experts on customer projects in the European Union. Furthermore, if the UK were to have an unplanned withdrawal this would compound the issues for our Company further as it is commonly believed that there would be resulting chaos and uncertainty, which would adversely affect the Company. It is also widely believed that in a worst-case scenario, the British Pound will be exposed to extreme exchange rate fluctuations between the major currencies including US Dollar and Euro. Many companies are seeking to mitigate the impact by seeking certain trading licenses in European Union member state countries. In anticipation of a No Deal Brexit, we are taking steps to mitigate this and have established a company, Coda Octopus Products A/S, in Denmark to maintain a presence in the European Union and to address the foreseeable issues. However, we can give no assurance that this in itself would be sufficient to address the impact of both a No Deal Brexit and an unplanned No Deal Brexit (i.e. crashing out of the European Union). B. Currency Risks: The Company's operations are split between the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and Denmark. A large proportion of our revenues (approximately 58%) and costs are incurred outside of the USA with a significant part (56% of our total revenues) of that in the United Kingdom ( UK\u201d). In addition, a significant part of our assets (both current and fixed) are held in British Pounds by our foreign subsidiaries. The depreciation of the British Pound against major currencies adversely impacts our revenues as a whole which are reported in U.S. Dollars. Furthermore, a large part of our assets is held in British Pounds while the majority of our liabilities (which comprise our senior secured debentures - see Note 8 of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements) are maintained in U.S. Dollars. In the 2018 period as compared to the same 2017 period, we realized a consolidated balance sheet loss on our assets due to the weakening of the British Pound against the US Dollar prevailing at October 31, 2018. In fiscal year 2018 compared to the 2017 period, we incurred a loss on our exchange rate translations in respect of our comprehensive income and loss account. See Note 2, paragraph n, of the audited Consolidated Financial Statements October 31, 2018 and 2017 regarding our Foreign Currency Translation policy. This currency risk is further exacerbated by the uncertainty around Brexit. C. Trade Disputes: The costs of our raw materials could become a serious concern due to inter-country trade disputes. Our US Services Segment has suffered increased cost of raw materials sourced within the United States due to ongoing trade dispute between the USA, China and Canada. D. Price of Commodities: The price of commodities, in particular O&G. The decline in O&G prices since 2014 with a partial recovery since 2016 has resulted in large scale reductions in capital and operational expenditures, which directly impact on the Products Segment by reducing the quantity of sales and rentals into O&G and related markets. O&G has remained very competitive and customers are increasingly seeking significant discounts to place orders. \nThe Company evaluates performance and allocates resources based upon operating income. The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in the summary of accounting policies.\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported values of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported levels of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nInformation concerning principal geographic areas is presented below according to the area where the activity is taking place for the years ended October 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively:\nThe reason for the decline in our Australia revenues is because we restructured our Australian operations in January 2018, whereby most of the sales in this territory are now done by our UK Edinburgh operations. This was done to reduce our overheads associated with sales.\nThe decrease in Operating Income in the 2018 period compared to the 2017 period is attributed to the increase of our R&D expenditures by 86.3% ($2,571,714 in the 2018 period compared to $1,380,381) for the reasons discussed earlier in conjunction with revenues remaining flat.\nOther Income:\nIntangible assets consist principally of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired (or goodwill), customer relationships, non-compete agreements and licenses. Goodwill was allocated to our reporting units based on the original purchase price allocation. Goodwill is not amortized and is evaluated for impairment annually or more often if circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Customer relationships, non-compete agreements, patents and licenses are being amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of 2 to 15 years. The Company amortizes its limited lived intangible assets using the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit. We periodically evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets and take into account events or circumstances that warrant revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate that impairment exists.\nFiscal Year 2018 Consolidated Results of Operations\nIn recent years, the Products and Services Segment have each generated 50% of our revenues. As a general rule, however, the Product Segment yields a higher Gross Profit Margin than the Services Segment. In both 2017 and 2018 fiscal years the Services Segment revenues and Net Income were substantially down and off plan due to the failure of new US Administration to pass a defense budget. This impact continued in 2018 on the Services Segment. In 2018 fiscal year therefore, Products Segment generated 64% of the Company's consolidated revenues and the Services Segment generated 36%. We consider this to be atypical and would anticipate in 2019 fiscal year Services Segment revenues will be more in line with 50% of our overall revenues.\n 25 \nIn addition, in recent years we have started to rent our real time 3D solutions with engineering services. Given the contraction in capital expenditures budget in the O&G market, rentals are increasingly becoming an important part of the composition of the Company's revenues and these O&G operators are more prepared to utilize operational budgets. Furthermore, our rental offering generally yields a higher gross margin for the Company.\nUpon surrender of our leased properties in Edinburgh in February 2019, we anticipate that the category of expenditures constituting Rent\u201d will decrease significantly.\nIncome Taxes\nOperating Income:\nThere are a number of reasons for the decline of our Comprehensive Income. In addition to loss of $190,232 in foreign currency translation (as compared to a gain of $299,006 in the 2017 period), Net Income fell by 32% in the 2018 period largely because revenues remained flat while Research and Development expenditures increased significantly in the 2018 period.\nDuring the 2018 period, the Company had one customer from whom it generated sales greater than 10% of net revenues. Revenue from this customer was $2,882,761 or 16% of net revenues during the period. Total accounts receivable from this customer at October 31, 2018 was $24,993 or 1% of accounts receivable.\n 26 \n \nFor the fiscal year ended 2018, 42% of the Company's operations were conducted inside the United States and 58% outside the United States through its wholly owned subsidiaries. As a result, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may significantly affect the Company's sales, profitability, balance sheet valuations and financial position when the foreign currencies of its international operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting. In addition, we are also subject to currency fluctuation risks with respect to certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables. Although the Company cannot predict the extent to which currency fluctuations may affect the Company's business and financial position, there is a risk that such fluctuations will have an adverse impact on the Company's sales, profits, balance sheet valuations and financial position. Because differing portions of our revenues and costs are denominated in foreign currency, movements could impact our margins by, for example, decreasing our foreign revenues when the dollar strengthens and not correspondingly decreasing our expenses. The Company does not currently hedge its currency exposure. In the future, we may engage in hedging transactions to mitigate foreign exchange risk.\nOn April 28, 2017, Coda Octopus Group, Inc. (the Company\u201d) together with its wholly owned US subsidiaries, Coda Octopus Products, Inc. and Coda Octopus Colmek, Inc. (together, the Subsidiaries\u201d), entered into a loan agreement with HSBC Bank NA (the Lender\u201d) for a loan in the principal amount of $8,000,000 (the Loan\u201d). The annual interest rate is fixed at 4.56%. Commencing on May 28, 2017 and continuing on the 28th day of each month thereafter, the Company was required to make monthly principal and interest payments of $149,350 until April 28, 2022 (making our annual payments under this Note $1,792,200). In addition, within 30 days after the delivery to the Lender of the Company's annual audited consolidated financial statements, the Company was required to make an annual principal payment of $700,000 during the term of the Loan. Such annual payments will reduce the balance of the principal outstanding. As a result, it was expected that the Loan will be repaid within a period of approximately 45 months. The Loan may be prepaid in whole or in part at any time subject to a break funding charge as detailed in the promissory note evidencing the Loan.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&A):\n 23 \nThis table shows that the effect of constant exchange rates, versus the actual exchange rate fluctuations, increased net income for the year by $119,634 and decreased net assets by $513,980.

Engineering (services). The products segment designs/manufactures products for subsea imaging, mapping, etc. The services segment provides engineering services to defense contractors.\n\nRevenue and Profits\n- Total revenue was flat year-over-year at around $18M. The products segment grew 4.2% while the services segment declined 6.7% due to delays in government defense contracts. \n- Operating income declined due to an 86.3% increase in R&D spending, while revenues were flat. Net income declined 32% for the same reasons.\n\nExpenses\n- R&D spending increased significantly to support new product development. This is expected to continue in 2019.\n- SG&A increased mainly due to one-time restructuring and legal costs related to a private placement offering. This is not expected to continue in 2019.\n\nLiquidity/Cash Flows\n- The company generated $5M in cash from operations. Cash balances can fund about one year of SG&A expenses.\n- The company paid down a significant portion of debt in 2018 and expects to repay remaining balances within 41 months.\n\nCurrency Fluctuations\n- Currency fluctuations had a negative impact on revenues and comprehensive income due to weakness in the British Pound. This may continue given economic uncertainty around Brexit.\n\nSegment Performance\n- The products segment performed well while delays in government defense spend impacted the services segment. This is expected to improve in 2019."}
