Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company's management. This MD&A is divided into four main sections:\n\u2022Overview\n\u2022Results of Operations\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies\nThe following MD&A should be read together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The MD&A includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in these forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nPlease see Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d for a discussion of Colfax's objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value.\nColfax conducts its operations through two operating segments: Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology.\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Air and Gas Handling - a global supplier of industrial centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, ventilation control systems and software, and aftermarket services; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Fabrication Technology - a global supplier of consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting, joining and automated welding of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCertain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d\nWe have a global footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Through our reportable segments, we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third-party distribution channels. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial and government customers.\nIntegral to our operations is CBS. CBS is our business management system, including a comprehensive set of tools. It includes repeatable, teachable processes that we use to drive continuous improvement and create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. We believe that our management team's access to, and experience in, the application of the CBS methodology is one of our primary competitive strengths.\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of DJO\nIn November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DJO Global Inc. ( DJO\u201d) for $3.2 billion in cash. DJO is a global developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-quality medical devices with a broad range of products used for orthopedic\nbracing, reconstructive implants, rehabilitation, pain management and physical therapy. Its products address the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to rehabilitation after surgery, injury or from degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion. DJO currently develops, manufactures and distributes its products through the following two markets: Prevention & Rehabilitation and Reconstructive.\nThis acquisition is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019. The related bank, senior notes and equity financing for the acquisition was completed in February 2019. The DJO acquisition represents a strategic evolution of Colfax that creates a new growth platform in the high-margin orthopedic solutions market.\nAir and Gas Handling Business\nConcurrent with our announcement of the DJO acquisition, we also announced that we are exploring strategic options for the Air and Gas Handling business including a potential divestiture. We have hired an advisor to assist in the process but cannot predict the outcome.\nOutlook\nWe believe that we are well positioned to grow our businesses organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base. Our current business mix is expected to be well balanced between long- and short-cycle businesses, sales in emerging markets and developed nations and foremarket and aftermarket products and services. Given this balance, management does not use indices other than general economic trends and business initiatives to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Instead, our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and outlook for the future.\nWe face a number of challenges and opportunities, including the successful integration of new acquisitions, application and expansion of our CBS tools to improve margins and working capital management, and rationalization of assets and costs.\nWe expect strategic acquisitions, such as our pending acquisition of DJO, to contribute to our growth. In the short-term, we\nwill focus on reducing leverage levels associated with financing for the DJO acquisition. We believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on future opportunities.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion of Results of Operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented. Our management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and Segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income before Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, and Restructuring and other related charges.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Reported Results\nOur financial performance and growth are driven by many factors, principally our ability to serve global markets, fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, general economic market conditions, the global economy and capital spending levels, the availability of capital, our estimates concerning asbestos litigation expense and liabilities and availability of insurance thereto, the impact of restructuring initiatives, our ability to pass cost increases on to customers through pricing, the impact of sales mix, our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions, and other factors. These key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future.\nGlobal Operations\nOur products and services are available worldwide. The manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region. During 2018, approximately 77% of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world. Our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations, including efficiently utilizing our global sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, participating in the expansion of market opportunities in emerging markets, successfully completing global strategic acquisitions and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets. However, we believe that our geographic, end market, customer and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nA significant portion of our Net sales, approximately 76% for 2018, is derived from operations outside the U.S., with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the U.S., a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion. Changes in\nforeign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on Net sales and Income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Changes in foreign exchange rates since December 31, 2017 decreased net assets by approximately 7%.\nDuring 2018, Argentina became a highly inflationary economy, resulting in the remeasurement of our Argentinian operations into Brazilian real, the functional currency of the Argentinian entity's direct parent. Gains and losses from the re-measurement are reflected in current earnings. Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Argentina on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Argentina operation represented less than 2% of our Total assets and Net sales. The devaluation of the peso resulted in a loss of $2.5 million recognized in the Fabrication Technology segment operating income during 2018.\nEconomic Conditions\nDemand for our products depends in part on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. While demand can be cyclical, we believe that our diversified operations generally limit the impact of a downturn in any one market on our consolidated results. Since the second half of 2017, declines in activity in the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets impacted our Air and Gas Handling segment. These declines reduced the levels of capital invested and maintenance expenditures made by certain of our customers, which in turn has reduced the demand for our products and services. During 2018, our Air and Gas Handling segment has strategically focused on initiatives to grow general industrial end markets, which has helped offset the impacts from the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets.\nSeasonality\nAs our air and gas handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year, historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July, August and December vacation seasons. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.\nRaw Material Costs\nWe believe our customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, design and application engineering support. Our results may be sensitive to price movements in our raw materials. Our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials including steel, iron, copper and aluminum. Historically, we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers. While we seek to take actions to manage this risk, future changes in component and raw material costs may adversely impact earnings.\nSales and Cost Mix\nOur profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors, including the type of product, the location in which the product is manufactured, the end market for which the product is designed, and the percentage of total revenue represented by aftermarket sales and services, which tend to often have higher margins than foremarket products and consumables.\nThe mix of sales was as follows for the periods presented:\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foremarket and equipment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Aftermarket and consumables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStrategic Acquisitions\nWe complement our organic growth plans with strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results, and we report the change in our Net sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses. Orders and order backlog are presented only for the longer-cycle Air and Gas Handling segment, where this information is relevant. The change in Net sales due to acquisitions for the periods presented in this filing represents the incremental sales from acquired businesses.\nAir and Gas Handling\nDuring 2018, we completed two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment for an aggregate net cash consideration of $35.9 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. These acquisitions expanded our technology and service offering for mining ventilation applications.\nDuring 2017, we completed two acquisitions in this segment for an aggregate purchase price of $219.6 million. This includes the acquisition of Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH (STE) from Siemens AG in the fourth quarter for cash consideration of $214.6 million. This acquisition broadened the segment's range of compression solutions and expanded its product offering into smaller steam turbines, and expands our end markets and product portfolio in environmental and industrial markets worldwide.\nFabrication Technology\nDuring 2018, we completed two acquisitions in the Fabrication Technology segment for net cash consideration of $245.1 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. This includes the acquisition of Gas Control Equipment (GCE) in the fourth quarter for cash consideration of $207.0 million. This acquisition expanded our technology and service offering for specialty gas applications.\nDuring 2017, we completed three acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $128.3 million. These acquisitions broadened our product offering and technology content.\nDuring 2016, we deployed approximately $26 million to acquire a business that increased the segment's product and technology offerings.\nTotal Company\nSales, Orders and Backlog\nNet sales from continuing operations increased from $3.2 billion in 2016 to $3.3 billion in 2017 and to $3.7 billion in 2018. The following table presents the components of changes in consolidated Net sales from continuing operations and, for our Air and Gas Handling segment, orders and order backlog:\nTable 148:

orders and order backlog valued at current year foreign exchange rates.\nThe increase in Net sales from existing businesses during 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to sales from both acquisitions and existing businesses. Net sales from acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment and Fabrication Technology segment were $141.2 million and $119.6 million, respectively. Net sales from existing businesses increased $171.5 million in our Fabrication Technology segment and decreased $44.0 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Fluctuation of foreign currency translation rates had a negative impact on Net sales of $21.7 million during the year. Air and Gas Handling orders increased by $129.9 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017; orders excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects decreased $30.3 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in the power generation end market, and a $20 million cancellation during the second quarter of 2018 due to newly-implemented restrictions implemented by the U.S. government.\nThe decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to decreases of $74.7 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment, mostly offset by an increase of $59.0 million in our Fabrication Technology segment. Air and Gas Handling orders, net of cancellations and excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects, decreased $44.1 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016 due to large project bookings during the second half of 2016 that did not repeat, delays in orders in the second half of 2017, and lower demand in power generation markets. The decline was partially offset by increases in general industrial and other end markets.\nOperating Results\nThe following table summarizes our results from continuing operations for the comparable three year period.\nTable 149: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,132.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,029.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>992.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>30.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>818.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>732.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>696.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related charges\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>77.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>68.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>236.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income margin\n</td> <td>6.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension settlement loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on short term investments\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>44.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit) provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>42.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nThe $103.3 million increase in Gross profit during 2018 in comparison to 2017 was attributable to an increase of $57.8 million in our Fabrication Technology segment and $45.6 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Acquisitions contributed $87.9 million of gross profit and restructuring initiatives added $19.9 million when compared to 2017. The positive impact of acquisitions and restructuring benefits was partially offset by lower sales volume in the Air and Gas Handling segment. Gross profit margin for 2018 included the effect in our Fabrication Technology segment of higher customer prices for certain products to offset input cost inflation, which commensurately increased both Net sales and Cost of sales and compressed total company Gross profit margin by 80 basis points.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $85.9 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017. The increase was mainly driven by a $74.2 million increase associated with acquisitions completed in 2018 in both Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology segments. Additionally, $6.6 million of acquisition-related costs were incurred during 2018 mainly related to the DJO acquisition.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment charges totaling $152.7 million. These charges consisted of a goodwill impairment of $150.2 million and an indefinite-lived trademark impairment charge of $2.5 million. Both charges related to our Air and Gas Handling segment. Additionally, we incurred a $46.9 million non-cash pension settlement loss in connection with a third-party buyout of one of our pension plans.\nThe Loss on short term investments of $10.1 million during 2018 was due to the change in fair value and subsequent sale of the CIRCOR Shares received in connection with the Fluid Handling business sale.\nInterest expense during 2018 increased by $3.0 million compared to 2017, primarily attributable to higher interest rates on our senior unsecured debt.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes was $182.8 million with a slight income tax benefit for 2018. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2018 was 0.0%, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a reduction in Tax Act related amounts originally provided for in the year ended December 31, 2017, U.S. R&D and foreign tax credits, the realization of deferred tax assets that previously had valuation allowances and the net favorable reduction of uncertain tax positions. These favorable items were offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized and permanent adjustments in an international jurisdiction. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.0 million and the Provision for income taxes was $42.6 million for 2017. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2017 was (355.0)%, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to non-deductible impairment losses, losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized offset in part by foreign earnings where\ninternational tax rates that are lower than the 2017 U.S. tax rate. The Tax Act provisional amounts did not have a significant net impact on the effective tax rate for 2017.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nThe $37.1 million increase in Gross profit during 2017 in comparison to 2016 was attributable to an increase of $49.6 million in our Fabrication Technology segment, partially offset by a decline of $12.5 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Acquisition-related growth in both segments contributed $32.1 million of Gross profit in 2017, and foreign exchange translation added another $14.0 million to the increase. These increases combined with $26.8 million of savings from restructuring initiatives, helped offset the impact of lower new build project margins and higher material costs experienced in 2017, keeping Gross profit margin consistent with the prior year.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $35.5 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016, which was attributable to increases in both Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology. The increases were mainly driven by $28.3 million increases associated with acquisitions completed in 2017, a $14.2 million increase in business development related expenses, partially offset by the incremental benefits realized from our restructuring programs and cost savings initiatives. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2017 compared to 2016, driven by accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess cost in response to the current market conditions.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment charges totaling $152.7 million. These charges consisted of a goodwill impairment of $150.2 million and an indefinite-lived trademark impairment charge of $2.5 million. Both charges related to our Air and Gas Handling segment. Additionally, we incurred a $46.9 million non-cash pension settlement loss in connection with a third-party buyout of one of our pension plans.\nInterest expense during 2017 increased by $10.8 million compared to 2016, primarily attributable to the senior note offering of \u20ac350 million in April 2017 and higher interest rates on our senior unsecured debt.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.0 million and the Provision for income taxes was $42.6 million for 2017. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2017 was (355.0)%, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to non-deductible impairment losses, losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized offset in part by foreign earnings where international tax rates that are lower than the 2017 U.S. tax rate. The Tax Act provisional amounts did not have a significant net impact on the effective tax rate for 2017. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $206.5 million and the Provision for income taxes was $51.8 million for 2016, resulting in a 25.1% effective tax rate that was primarily driven by foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. federal tax rate.\nBusiness Segments\nAs discussed further above, we report results in two reportable segments: Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology.\nAir and Gas Handling\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our Air and Gas Handling segment:\nTable 150: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,473.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,362.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,385.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>403.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>357.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>370.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>27.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>269.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>231.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>220.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>134.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income margin\n</td> <td>9.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Items not included in segment results:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related items\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>52.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales increased by $110.8 million with acquisition-related growth contributing $141.2 million. Net sales from existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, decreased by $44.0 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017 primarily due to declines in the power generation and oil, gas, and petrochemical end markets, partially offset by increases in general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $13.6 million on Net sales. Gross profit increased during 2018, reflecting acquisition-related growth of $44.7 million and a positive foreign currency translation impact of $3.9 million. Gross profit margin improved 110 basis points during 2018, reflecting positive impacts of acquisitions, savings from previously executed restructuring initiatives, improved project execution and favorable change in project mix driven by our aftermarket initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due to $41.0 million acquisition-related growth and foreign currency translation impact of $4.2 million partially offset by a $7.1 million gain on sale of facility recognized in the first quarter of 2018. Restructuring and other related charges decreased during 2018 as certain projects to eliminate excess cost in response to the change in market conditions in late 2017 were completed.\nNet sales from existing businesses decreased by $74.7 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016 primarily due to declines in the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets, partially offset by increases in mining and general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, acquisition-related growth contributed $37.1 million, and changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $15.2 million on Net sales. Gross profit and Gross profit margin decreased during 2017, which was primarily the result of lower volumes and project margins. These decreases were partially offset by $8.6 million of acquisition-related growth and $18.6 million incremental benefits realized from restructuring programs and cost savings initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016, which is mainly the result of acquisition-related increases of $10.4 million. The lower Segment operating income and Segment operating income margin in 2017 compared to 2016 were the result of lower Gross profit and the increase in Selling, general and administrative expense discussed above. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2017 driven by accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess cost in response to the current market conditions. In 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $150.2 million and a trade name impairment charge of $2.5 million, as a result of conclusions reached from performing our annual impairment tests.\nFabrication Technology\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our Fabrication Technology segment:\nTable 151: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Three Months Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,193.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,937.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,800.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>729.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>671.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>622.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit margin\n</td> <td>33.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>479.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>426.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>249.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>224.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>195.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment operating income margin\n</td> <td>11.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Items not included in segment results:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other related items\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intangible asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 13.2% Net sales increase during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of an increase in existing businesses of $171.5 million with continued growth in most markets and acquisition-related growth of $119.6 million. Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $35.3 million on Net sales. The growth rate from existing businesses included 4.8% from increased customer prices to address higher material and inflation costs, and 4.1% from higher volumes. The increase in Gross profit during 2018 is driven by the acquisition-related growth of $43.2 million and increased sales volumes. Gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to the dilutive effect of input cost inflation being addressed by higher customer prices for certain products. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $32.2 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily driven by an $33.2 million acquisition-related increase and higher costs to support growth initiatives, offset by a $10.9 million net benefit from facility sales in the fourth quarter. Restructuring and other related items increased in 2018 in comparison to 2017, as a result of expanded cost reduction programs.\nThe Net sales increase during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in existing businesses of $59.0 million, led by a market recovery in North America and growth in certain developing regions. Acquisition-related growth contributed $48.1 million of incremental sales in 2017, and foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $29.7 million. Gross profit increased in 2017 due to acquisition-related growth of $23.4 million and increases in volumes from existing businesses. Costs savings associated with restructuring programs added another $8.2 million of additional gross profit in the current year. These increases were partially offset by a $38.6 million increase in cost of goods sold due to higher commodity prices in 2017. Gross margin increased 20 basis points due to the positive impact from increased volumes and favorable mix, which was partially offset by higher raw material costs during the year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $20.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and was primarily attributable to a $17.9 million increase in acquisition-related cost. Segment operating income margin expanded approximately 80 basis points due to higher sales and improved profit margin. Restructuring and other related items decreased in 2017 in comparison to 2016, consistent with management's plan.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOverview\nWe have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, various borrowings and issuances of equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for current and projected debt service requirements, working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, asbestos-related expenses and funding of pension plans and restructuring programs. If determined appropriate for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes, we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We are also party to letter of credit facilities with total capacity of $757.4 million, of which $344.1 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DJO for $3.2 billion in cash. We are financing this acquisition, in part, by (1) entering into the New Credit Facility (as described below in this section); (2) an offering for $460 million of tangible equity units; and (3) an offering for $1 billion of senior unsecured notes (the 2024 Notes\u201d and 2026 Notes\u201d). See Note 12, Debt\u201d and Note 20 Subsequent Events\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nEquity Capital\nOn February 12, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by an additional $100 million on June 6, 2018, and again for an additional $100 million on July 19, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors was $100.0 million.\nOn October 11, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which were to be retired upon repurchase. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our Common stock in open market transactions for $20.8 million. The repurchase program expired as of December 31, 2016. See Note 13, Equity\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nDB Credit Agreement\nThe proceeds of the loans under the DB Credit Agreement were used by us to repay in full balances under our preexisting credit agreement, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DB Credit Agreement consists of a term loan in the aggregate amount of $750.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) with a commitment capacity of $1.3 billion, each of which had an initial maturity term of five years. The Revolver contains a $50.0 million swing line loan sub-facility. See Note 12, Debt\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate of borrowings under the DB Credit Agreement was 3.92%, excluding accretion of original issue discount and deferred financing fees, and there was $1.1 billion available on the revolving credit facility.\nWe currently intend to repay the existing Term Loan Facility and the Revolver with the proceeds of the New Credit Facility (as defined below), at which time the Term Loan Facility and Revolver will be terminated.\nEuro Notes\nOn April 19, 2017, we issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac350 million (the Euro Notes\u201d). The Euro Notes are due on April 15, 2025 and have an interest rate of 3.25%. The proceeds from the Euro Notes offering were used to repay borrowings under our DB Credit Agreement and bilateral credit facilities totaling \u20ac283.5 million, as well as for general corporate purposes, and are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.\nIn total, as of December 31, 2018, we had an original issue discount of $1.5 million and deferred financing fees of $6.9 million included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, which will be accreted to Interest expense primarily using the effective interest method, over the life of the applicable debt.\n2022 Tangible Equity Units\nOn January 11, 2019, we issued $460 million in tangible equity units. We offered 4 million of its 5.75% tangible equity units at the stated amount of $100 per unit. An option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 tangible equity units at the stated amount of $100 per unit was exercised in full at settlement. Total cash of $447.7 million was received upon closing, comprised of $377.8 million prepaid stock purchase contracts and $69.9 million of senior amortizing notes due January 2022. The proceeds will be used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the DJO acquisition and for general corporate purposes. If the DJO acquisition does not close by May 19, 2019, we will have the option to exercise certain redemption rights. Unless the 4.6 million stock purchase contracts are redeemed by us or settled earlier at the unit holder's option, they are mandatorily convertible into shares of our common stock at not less than 4.0 shares per purchase contract or more than 4.8054 shares per purchase contract on January 15, 2022. This corresponds to not less than 18.4 million shares and not more than 22.1 million shares at the maximum.\n2024 Notes and 2026 Notes\nOn February 5, 2019, CFX Escrow Corporation issued two tranches of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600 million (the 2024 Notes\u201d) and $400 million (the 2026 Notes\u201d) to finance a portion of the DJO acquisition. The 2024 Notes are due on February 5, 2024 and have an interest rate of 6.0%. The 2026 Notes are due on February 5, 2026 and have an interest rate of 6.375%. Upon closing of the acquisition, we will assume all of CFX Escrow Corporation's obligations under the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes and each tranche of notes will be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.\nNew Term Loan Facilities and New Revolving Credit Facility\nOn December 17, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Facility\u201d) by and among the Company, as the borrower, certain of our U.S. subsidiaries identified therein, as guarantors, each of the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, as syndication agent, and the co-documentation agents named therein. The New Credit Facility consists of a revolving credit facility which totals $1.3 billion in commitments (the New Revolver\u201d) and a Term A-1 loan in an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion (the Five Year Term Loan\u201d), each of which matures in five years, and a Term A-2 loan in an aggregate amount of $500 million, which matures in two years (the Two Year Term Loan\u201d and, together with the Five Year Term Loan, the New Term Loan Facilities\u201d). The New Revolver contains a $50 million swing line loan sub-facility.\nThe initial credit extensions under the New Credit Facility will only be made available to us, subject to certain conditions precedent, on the date of consummation of the DJO acquisition. The proceeds of such initial credit extensions shall be used on such date (i) to replace the commitments, and repay in full amounts outstanding, under the DB Credit Agreement, (ii) to pay a portion of the consideration in connection with the DJO acquisition, and (iii) for fees and expenses related to the foregoing. Following the consummation of the DJO acquisition, credit extensions under the New Revolver will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe New Term Loan Facilities and the New Revolver will bear interest, at our election, at either the base rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin. See Note 12, Debt\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOther Indebtedness\nIn addition to the debt agreements discussed above, we are party to various bilateral credit facilities with a borrowing capacity of $271.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under these facilities totaled $71.0 million, with a weighted average borrowing rate of 3.59%.\nWe are also party to letter of credit facilities with an aggregate capacity of $757.4 million. Total letters of credit of $344.1 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $245.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $17.0 million from $262.0 million as of December 31, 2017.

Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2017 included net proceeds of $490.3 million from the sale of the Fluid Handling business and net cash outflows of $346.8 million associated with two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment and three acquisitions in our Fabrication Technology segment.\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2018 were impacted by the repurchase of 6.4 million shares of our Common stock for $200.0 million, partially offset by $158.2 million of proceeds from borrowings. The outflow in 2017 is attributable to the repayment of borrowings under the DB credit agreement and bilateral credit facilities for $651.8 million, reduced by proceeds from the issuance of Euro Notes. The cash outflows in 2016 were due to repayment of borrowings under the DB credit agreement and bilateral credit facilities of $118.8 million and share repurchases of $20.8 million.\nOur Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 included $242.0 million held in jurisdictions outside the U.S. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. If however, we elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, such repatriation remittances may be subject to taxes and other local statutory restrictions.\nPrior Disclosure Under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, Colfax is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, including certain activities involving Iran.\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, certain Colfax non-U.S. subsidiaries conducted business involving Iran authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC\u201d) under General License H and Sec. 560.537 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctioned Regulations ( ITSR\u201d). General License H authorized U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities to engage in certain business involving Iran and Sec. 560.537 authorized the wind down of such business on or before November 4, 2018.\nIn October 2018, a non-U.S. Howden subsidiary in the Czech Republic sold a control system valued at $57,083 for end use in the Iranian petrochemical sector pursuant to Sec. 560.537. The sale did not generate a profit. The information provided pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act in Item 5 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Reports on 10-Q for the quarter ended June 29, 2018 is also hereby incorporated by reference. In compliance with the revocation of General License H and the expiration of Sec. 560.537, we do not intend to continue these activities.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 157: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\nOne Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>798.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>400.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,204.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on debt(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>114.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>138.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>252.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>274.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>332.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>897.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>447.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,731.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of 3.92%.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 159: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Excludes open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which is not certain.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have funding requirements associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018, which are estimated to be $14.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. Other long-term liabilities, such as those for\nasbestos and other legal claims, employee benefit plan obligations, deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2018 other than outstanding letters of credit of $344.1 million, unconditional purchase obligations with suppliers of $274.3 million, and $138.0 million of future operating lease payments.\nOn February 5, 2019, CFX Escrow Corporation issued two tranches of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600 million (the 2024 Notes\u201d) and $400 million (the 2026 Notes\u201d). Upon closing of the DJO acquisition, we will assume all of CFX Escrow Corporation's obligations under the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes. See Note 12, Debt\u201d for further information.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have in the past divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, certain representations, warranties and indemnities were made to purchasers to cover various risks or unknown liabilities. We cannot estimate the potential liability, if any, that may result from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown and unexpected contingencies; however, we do not believe that any such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\nAsbestos Liabilities and Insurance Assets\nCertain subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos. Such components were acquired from third-party suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of our subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos. The manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries' customers, including the U.S. Navy.\nWe sold our Fluid Handling business to CIRCOR International ( CIRCOR\u201d), Inc., a Delaware corporation on December 11, 2017. Pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) signed on September 24, 2017, we retained the asbestos-related contingencies and insurance coverages. However, as we did not retain an interest in the ongoing operations of the business subject to the contingencies, we have classified asbestos-related activity in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of Income (loss) from discontinuing operations, net of taxes. See Note 4, Discontinued Operations\u201d for further information.\nWe have projected future asbestos-related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the Nicholson methodology. The Nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts. This methodology is based upon risk equations, exposed population estimates, mortality rates, and other demographic statistics. In applying the Nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed: (1) an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos; (2) a review of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos-related diseases in each year; (3) an analysis of the subsidiaries' recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases and (4) an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values, which vary by disease type, jurisdiction and the nature\nof claim, to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims. Our projections, based upon the Nicholson methodology, estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item (2) above. It is our policy to record a liability for asbestos-related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years.\nProjecting future asbestos-related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict, including, among others, the number of claims that might be received, the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the financial resources of other companies that are co-defendants in the claims, funds available in post-bankruptcy trusts, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards, including potential tort reform. Furthermore, any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. These trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability, and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods. Accordingly, we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assess whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate. Taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties, we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next 15 years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate. While it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period, we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years. Defense costs associated with asbestos-related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries' insurers are expensed as incurred.\nWe assessed the subsidiaries' existing insurance arrangements and agreements, estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims, analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness and solvency of the various insurers, and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities. The analysis took into account self-insurance retentions, policy exclusions, pending litigation, liability caps and gaps in coverage, existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies.\nEach subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to our ownership of each independent entity. In our evaluation of the insurance asset, we use differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary.\nManagement's analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolving each claim, coverage issues among layers of insurers, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, the amount of remaining insurance available, as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nSee Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our asbestos liabilities and insurance assets.\nRetirement Benefits\nPension obligations and other post-retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions, including the discount rate, assumed annual rates of return on plan assets, and per capita cost of covered health care benefits. Changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post-retirement expense recognized in future periods. These assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions. See Note 15, Defined Benefit Plans\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit or asset exceeds its value.\nIn the evaluation of Goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the reporting entity's fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that entity. In certain instances, we may elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired. Pursuant to ASU 2017-04, which we elected to adopt during the three months ended December 31, 2017, if the carrying value of the reporting unit's Goodwill is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nGenerally, we measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows and a market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow models indicate the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future. Significant estimates in the discounted cash flow models include: the weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison against certain market information. Significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nIn 2016, we experienced a concurrent decline in numerous end-markets and geographic markets that negatively impacted both of our reporting units. We elected not to perform qualitative assessments of Goodwill and instead, proceeded directly to performing the first step of quantitative Goodwill impairment test for its 2016 annual impairment test. The quantitative impairment assessment of Goodwill for each of the Fabrication Technology and Air and Gas Handling reporting units, based on the methodologies identified above, resulted in calculated fair values that exceeded the carrying values for both reporting units. As such, no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the annual Goodwill impairment analysis performed as of October 1, 2016.\nDue to continued declines in various end markets for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit, we performed a quantitative analysis for this reporting unit as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing. In 2017, the quantitative Goodwill impairment assessment for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit resulted in a calculated fair value lower than carrying value. As a result, an impairment charge of $150.2 million, which equals the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit resulted in a carrying value lower than the calculated fair value. As a result, no impairment existed. A qualitative assessment of Goodwill was performed for the Fabrication Technology reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which indicated no impairment existed.\nIn the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying value, a calculation is performed and compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We measure the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty\u201d method. Significant estimates in this approach include projected revenues and royalty and discount rates for each trade name evaluated.\nThe annual impairment analysis performed as of October 1, 2016 for indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\nDuring the annual impairment analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017, quantitative analyses were performed, as of September 30, 2017 for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit trade names due to continued declines in various end markets. The analyses determined the fair value was lower than carrying value for one trade name, which resulted in an impairment charge of $2.5 million for that trade name. The calculated fair value of the trade name was $11.7 million and is included in Level Three of the fair value hierarchy. For another indefinite-lived intangible trade name, the analysis determined the fair value was marginally greater than its $22.1 million carrying value. A qualitative assessment was performed for the Fabrication Technology reporting unit trade names for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which indicated no impairment existed.\nDue to changes in market multiples, weighted average cost of capital and, to a lesser extent, declines in certain end markets for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2018, we decided to perform a quantitative analysis for this reporting unit as of September 29, 2018. The quantitative analysis resulted in a calculated fair value that was higher than the reporting unit's carrying value by 9%. As a result, no impairment charges were recorded.\nImpairment charges related to Goodwill and Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe continuation of a sustained decline in our end-markets and geographic markets could increase the risk of impairments in future years. Actual results could differ from our estimates and projections, which would also affect the assessment of impairment. As of December 31, 2018, we have Goodwill of $2.6 billion and indefinite lived trade names of $383.8 million that are subject to at least annual review for impairment. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance, we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nAccounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a position taken in a tax return. Under this standard, we must presume the income tax position will be examined by a relevant tax authority and determine whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. An income tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect our estimates, such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits and, if applicable, the conclusion of any court proceedings. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the (Benefit) provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, were $37.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and are included in Other liabilities or as a reduction to deferred tax assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code which included how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. Key changes in the Tax Act which are relevant to us and generally effective January 1, 2018 include a flat corporate income tax rate of 21 percent to replace the marginal rates that range from 15 percent to 35 percent, elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax, the creation of a territorial tax system replacing the worldwide tax system, a one-time tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings ( Transition Tax\u201d) to transition to the territorial system, a minimum tax\u201d on certain foreign earnings above an enumerated rate of return, a new base erosion anti-abuse tax that subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to its foreign subsidiary to additional taxes, and an incentive for U.S. companies to sell, lease or license goods and services outside the U.S. by taxing the income at a reduced effective rate. The new tax also imposes limits on executive compensation and interest expense deductions, while permitting the immediate expensing for the cost of new investments in certain property acquired after September 27, 2017.\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows registrants to include a provisional amount to account for the implications of the Tax Act where a reasonable estimate can be made and requires the completion of the accounting no later than one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act or December 22, 2018. We filed our 2017 U.S. income tax return in the fourth quarter of 2018, which changed our tax basis in temporary differences and Transition Tax estimated as of December 31, 2017, resulting in an adjustment to the tax provision to the re-measurement amount recorded in the financial statements.\nASC 740 requires changes in tax rates and tax laws to be accounted for in the period of enactment in continuing operations. Accordingly, of significance, we included a provisional estimate of approximately $52 million for the Transition Tax, payable over 8 years for our year ended December 31, 2017. Pursuant to SAB 118, we reduced our provisional amount for Transition Tax by $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Generally, the foreign earnings subject to the Transition Tax can be distributed without additional U.S. tax; however, if distributed, the amount could be subject to foreign taxes and U.S. state and local taxes. We continue to maintain its indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method. We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services. The nature of our contracts gives rise to certain types of variable consideration, including rebates, liquidated damages, and other discounts. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Estimates are based on historical or anticipated performance and represent our best judgment at the time. Any estimates are evaluated on a quarterly basis until the uncertainty is resolved.\nWe provide a variety of products and services to our customers. Most of our contracts consist of a single, distinct performance obligation or promise to transfer goods or services to a customer. For contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation.\nA majority of the revenue we recognize relates to contracts with customers for standard or off-the-shelf products. As control typically transfers to the customer upon shipment of the product in these circumstances, revenue is generally recognized at that point in time. For service contracts, we recognize revenue ratably over the period of performance as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services provided.\nIn certain contracts, particularly within the Air and Gas Handling segment, we are engaged to engineer and build highly-customized, large-scale products and systems. In these circumstances, we produce an asset with no alternative use and have a right to payment for performance completed to date. As a result, revenue is recognized over time based on progress to date. To measure progress, we use an input method based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. Under this method, contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract. The amount recognized is directly proportionate to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. This method requires estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition. Significant management judgments and estimates, including estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized during each period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available. The revisions are recorded in income in the period in which they are determined using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.\nGiven the nature of these long-term contracts, we are often paid at various points throughout the process, based on the contractual terms. We apply the available practical expedient involving the existence of a significant financing component. As we generally do not receive payments greater than one year in advance or arrears of revenue recognition, we do not consider any arrangements to include financing components.\nAny recognized revenues in excess of customer billings are recorded as a component of Trade receivables. Billings to customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a component of Customer advances and billings in excess of costs incurred. For long-term contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses, based on the specified timeline included in the contractual terms. Each contract is evaluated individually to determine the net asset or net liability position. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were $168.3 million and $203.9 million, respectively, of revenues in excess of billings and $68.1 million and $94.2 million, respectively, of billings in excess of revenues on long-term contracts in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For contracts recognized at a point in time, revenue recognition and billing typically occur simultaneously.\nThe period of benefit for our incremental costs of obtaining a contract would generally have less than a one-year duration; therefore, we apply the practical expedient available and expenses costs to obtain a contract when incurred.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $35.2 million and $31.5 million as of\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, see Note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.", "item_7_truncated": "Global Operations\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Air and Gas Handling\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Orders(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Backlog at Period End\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In millions)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of and for the year ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,185.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,305.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>796.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Change:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Existing businesses(2)\n</td> <td>(15.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(57.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions(3)\n</td> <td>85.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation(4)\n</td> <td>44.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>114.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>97.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of and for the year ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,300.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,306.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>893.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Components of Change:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Existing businesses(2)\n</td> <td>127.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2.3\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(49.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.5\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisitions(3)\n</td> <td>260.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>136.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency translation(4)\n</td> <td>(21.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.7\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(42.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>366.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>129.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(61.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,666.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,436.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>832.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe complement our organic growth plans with strategic acquisitions.

We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services. The nature of our contracts gives rise to certain types of variable consideration, including rebates, liquidated damages, and other discounts. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Estimates are based on historical or anticipated performance and represent our best judgment at the time. Any estimates are evaluated on a quarterly basis until the uncertainty is resolved.\nOur financial performance and growth are driven by many factors, principally our ability to serve global markets, fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, general economic market conditions, the global economy and capital spending levels, the availability of capital, our estimates concerning asbestos litigation expense and liabilities and availability of insurance thereto, the impact of restructuring initiatives, our ability to pass cost increases on to customers through pricing, the impact of sales mix, our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions, and other factors. These key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future.\nIn addition to the debt agreements discussed above, we are party to various bilateral credit facilities with a borrowing capacity of $271.9 million.

In 2017, the quantitative Goodwill impairment assessment for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit resulted in a calculated fair value lower than carrying value.

We apply the available practical expedient involving the existence of a significant financing component. As we generally do not receive payments greater than one year in advance or arrears of revenue recognition, we do not consider any arrangements to include financing components.\nEach subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to our ownership of each independent entity. In our evaluation of the insurance asset, we use differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary.\n(2) Excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, thus providing a measure of growth due to factors such as price, product mix and volume.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company's management. This MD&A is divided into four main sections:\nWe evaluate the recoverability of Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit or asset exceeds its value.\nPrior Disclosure Under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows registrants to include a provisional amount to account for the implications of the Tax Act where a reasonable estimate can be made and requires the completion of the accounting no later than one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act or December 22, 2018. We filed our 2017 U.S. income tax return in the fourth quarter of 2018, which changed our tax basis in temporary differences and Transition Tax estimated as of December 31, 2017, resulting in an adjustment to the tax provision to the re-measurement amount recorded in the financial statements.\nImpairment charges related to Goodwill and Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInterest expense during 2018 increased by $3.0 million compared to 2017, primarily attributable to higher interest rates on our senior unsecured debt.\nOn January 11, 2019, we issued $460 million in tangible equity units. We offered 4 million of its 5.75% tangible equity units at the stated amount of $100 per unit. An option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 tangible equity units at the stated amount of $100 per unit was exercised in full at settlement. Total cash of $447.7 million was received upon closing, comprised of $377.8 million prepaid stock purchase contracts and $69.9 million of senior amortizing notes due January 2022. The proceeds will be used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the DJO acquisition and for general corporate purposes. If the DJO acquisition does not close by May 19, 2019, we will have the option to exercise certain redemption rights. Unless the 4.6 million stock purchase contracts are redeemed by us or settled earlier at the unit holder's option, they are mandatorily convertible into shares of our common stock at not less than 4.0 shares per purchase contract or more than 4.8054 shares per purchase contract on January 15, 2022. This corresponds to not less than 18.4 million shares and not more than 22.1 million shares at the maximum.\nThe continuation of a sustained decline in our end-markets and geographic markets could increase the risk of impairments in future years. Actual results could differ from our estimates and projections, which would also affect the assessment of impairment. As of December 31, 2018, we have Goodwill of $2.6 billion and indefinite lived trade names of $383.8 million that are subject to at least annual review for impairment. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results from continuing operations for the comparable three year period.\nOther Indebtedness\nThe Net sales increase during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in existing businesses of $59.0 million, led by a market recovery in North America and growth in certain developing regions. Acquisition-related growth contributed $48.1 million of incremental sales in 2017, and foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $29.7 million. Gross profit increased in 2017 due to acquisition-related growth of $23.4 million and increases in volumes from existing businesses. Costs savings associated with restructuring programs added another $8.2 million of additional gross profit in the current year. These increases were partially offset by a $38.6 million increase in cost of goods sold due to higher commodity prices in 2017. Gross margin increased 20 basis points due to the positive impact from increased volumes and favorable mix, which was partially offset by higher raw material costs during the year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $20.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and was primarily attributable to a $17.9 million increase in acquisition-related cost. Segment operating income margin expanded approximately 80 basis points due to higher sales and improved profit margin. Restructuring and other related items decreased in 2017 in comparison to 2016, consistent with management's plan.\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.\n \u2022 Funding requirements of our defined benefit plans, including pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash contributions for defined benefit plans were $36.3 million, $37.9 million and $34.5 million, respectively. \nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $35.5 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016, which was attributable to increases in both Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology. The increases were mainly driven by $28.3 million increases associated with acquisitions completed in 2017, a $14.2 million increase in business development related expenses, partially offset by the incremental benefits realized from our restructuring programs and cost savings initiatives. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2017 compared to 2016, driven by accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess cost in response to the current market conditions.\nwill focus on reducing leverage levels associated with financing for the DJO acquisition. We believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on future opportunities.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nManagement's analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolving each claim, coverage issues among layers of insurers, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, the amount of remaining insurance available, as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe currently intend to repay the existing Term Loan Facility and the Revolver with the proceeds of the New Credit Facility (as defined below), at which time the Term Loan Facility and Revolver will be terminated.\n(3) Represents the incremental sales, orders and order backlog as a result of our acquisitions discussed previously.\nWe have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, various borrowings and issuances of equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for current and projected debt service requirements, working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, asbestos-related expenses and funding of pension plans and restructuring programs. If determined appropriate for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes, we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We are also party to letter of credit facilities with total capacity of $757.4 million, of which $344.1 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nOn February 12, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by an additional $100 million on June 6, 2018, and again for an additional $100 million on July 19, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors was $100.0 million.\nThe $37.1 million increase in Gross profit during 2017 in comparison to 2016 was attributable to an increase of $49.6 million in our Fabrication Technology segment, partially offset by a decline of $12.5 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Acquisition-related growth in both segments contributed $32.1 million of Gross profit in 2017, and foreign exchange translation added another $14.0 million to the increase. These increases combined with $26.8 million of savings from restructuring initiatives, helped offset the impact of lower new build project margins and higher material costs experienced in 2017, keeping Gross profit margin consistent with the prior year.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate of borrowings under the DB Credit Agreement was 3.92%, excluding accretion of original issue discount and deferred financing fees, and there was $1.1 billion available on the revolving credit facility.\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2018 were impacted by the repurchase of 6.4 million shares of our Common stock for $200.0 million, partially offset by $158.2 million of proceeds from borrowings. The outflow in 2017 is attributable to the repayment of borrowings under the DB credit agreement and bilateral credit facilities for $651.8 million, reduced by proceeds from the issuance of Euro Notes. The cash outflows in 2016 were due to repayment of borrowings under the DB credit agreement and bilateral credit facilities of $118.8 million and share repurchases of $20.8 million.\n(4) Represents the difference between prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at the actual prior year foreign exchange rates and prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at current year foreign exchange rates.\nSales and Cost Mix\nIn October 2018, a non-U.S. Howden subsidiary in the Czech Republic sold a control system valued at $57,083 for end use in the Iranian petrochemical sector pursuant to Sec. 560.537. The sale did not generate a profit. The information provided pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act in Item 5 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Reports on 10-Q for the quarter ended June 29, 2018 is also hereby incorporated by reference. In compliance with the revocation of General License H and the expiration of Sec. 560.537, we do not intend to continue these activities.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $85.9 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017. The increase was mainly driven by a $74.2 million increase associated with acquisitions completed in 2018 in both Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology segments. Additionally, $6.6 million of acquisition-related costs were incurred during 2018 mainly related to the DJO acquisition.\nCash Flows\nThe New Term Loan Facilities and the New Revolver will bear interest, at our election, at either the base rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin. See Note 12, Debt\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes was $182.8 million with a slight income tax benefit for 2018. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2018 was 0.0%, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a reduction in Tax Act related amounts originally provided for in the year ended December 31, 2017, U.S. R&D and foreign tax credits, the realization of deferred tax assets that previously had valuation allowances and the net favorable reduction of uncertain tax positions. These favorable items were offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized and permanent adjustments in an international jurisdiction. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.0 million and the Provision for income taxes was $42.6 million for 2017. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2017 was (355.0)%, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to non-deductible impairment losses, losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized offset in part by foreign earnings where\nWe have a global footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Through our reportable segments, we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third-party distribution channels. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial and government customers.\n\u2022Overview\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have in the past divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, certain representations, warranties and indemnities were made to purchasers to cover various risks or unknown liabilities. We cannot estimate the potential liability, if any, that may result from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown and unexpected contingencies; however, we do not believe that any such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n \u2022 Net cash received or paid for asbestos-related costs, net of insurance proceeds, including the disposition of claims, defense costs and legal expenses related to litigation against our insurers, creates variability in our operating cash flows. We had net cash outflows of $5.6 million, $3.7 million and $16.0 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash outflows for 2018 and 2017 were net of $57.0 million and $63.9 million, respectively, of reimbursements from insurance companies on our asbestos insurance receivable. \nGoodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names.\nFabrication Technology\nSeasonality\nEuro Notes\nAny recognized revenues in excess of customer billings are recorded as a component of Trade receivables. Billings to customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a component of Customer advances and billings in excess of costs incurred. For long-term contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses, based on the specified timeline included in the contractual terms. Each contract is evaluated individually to determine the net asset or net liability position. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were $168.3 million and $203.9 million, respectively, of revenues in excess of billings and $68.1 million and $94.2 million, respectively, of billings in excess of revenues on long-term contracts in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For contracts recognized at a point in time, revenue recognition and billing typically occur simultaneously.\n\u2022Results of Operations\n \u2022 Air and Gas Handling - a global supplier of industrial centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, ventilation control systems and software, and aftermarket services; and \nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our Fabrication Technology segment:\nResults of Operations\nThe annual impairment analysis performed as of October 1, 2016 for indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2018 other than outstanding letters of credit of $344.1 million, unconditional purchase obligations with suppliers of $274.3 million, and $138.0 million of future operating lease payments.\nIn total, as of December 31, 2018, we had an original issue discount of $1.5 million and deferred financing fees of $6.9 million included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, which will be accreted to Interest expense primarily using the effective interest method, over the life of the applicable debt.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet sales from existing businesses decreased by $74.7 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016 primarily due to declines in the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets, partially offset by increases in mining and general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, acquisition-related growth contributed $37.1 million, and changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $15.2 million on Net sales. Gross profit and Gross profit margin decreased during 2017, which was primarily the result of lower volumes and project margins. These decreases were partially offset by $8.6 million of acquisition-related growth and $18.6 million incremental benefits realized from restructuring programs and cost savings initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016, which is mainly the result of acquisition-related increases of $10.4 million. The lower Segment operating income and Segment operating income margin in 2017 compared to 2016 were the result of lower Gross profit and the increase in Selling, general and administrative expense discussed above. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2017 driven by accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess cost in response to the current market conditions. In 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $150.2 million and a trade name impairment charge of $2.5 million, as a result of conclusions reached from performing our annual impairment tests.\nThe following MD&A should be read together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The MD&A includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in these forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nSales, Orders and Backlog\nof claim, to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims. Our projections, based upon the Nicholson methodology, estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item (2) above. It is our policy to record a liability for asbestos-related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years.\nDuring 2017, we completed two acquisitions in this segment for an aggregate purchase price of $219.6 million. This includes the acquisition of Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH (STE) from Siemens AG in the fourth quarter for cash consideration of $214.6 million. This acquisition broadened the segment's range of compression solutions and expanded its product offering into smaller steam turbines, and expands our end markets and product portfolio in environmental and industrial markets worldwide.\nWe believe our customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, design and application engineering support. Our results may be sensitive to price movements in our raw materials. Our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials including steel, iron, copper and aluminum. Historically, we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers. While we seek to take actions to manage this risk, future changes in component and raw material costs may adversely impact earnings.\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, see Note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe have funding requirements associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018, which are estimated to be $14.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. Other long-term liabilities, such as those for\nOur Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 included $242.0 million held in jurisdictions outside the U.S. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. If however, we elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, such repatriation remittances may be subject to taxes and other local statutory restrictions.\nDuring 2016, we deployed approximately $26 million to acquire a business that increased the segment's product and technology offerings.\nDuring 2018, Argentina became a highly inflationary economy, resulting in the remeasurement of our Argentinian operations into Brazilian real, the functional currency of the Argentinian entity's direct parent. Gains and losses from the re-measurement are reflected in current earnings. Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Argentina on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Argentina operation represented less than 2% of our Total assets and Net sales. The devaluation of the peso resulted in a loss of $2.5 million recognized in the Fabrication Technology segment operating income during 2018.\n\nAcquisition of DJO\nEquity Capital\nAccounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a position taken in a tax return. Under this standard, we must presume the income tax position will be examined by a relevant tax authority and determine whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. An income tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect our estimates, such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits and, if applicable, the conclusion of any court proceedings. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the (Benefit) provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, were $37.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and are included in Other liabilities or as a reduction to deferred tax assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAir and Gas Handling\nThe period of benefit for our incremental costs of obtaining a contract would generally have less than a one-year duration; therefore, we apply the practical expedient available and expenses costs to obtain a contract when incurred.\nCertain subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos. Such components were acquired from third-party suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of our subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos. The manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries' customers, including the U.S. Navy.\nRetirement Benefits\nNet sales increased by $110.8 million with acquisition-related growth contributing $141.2 million. Net sales from existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, decreased by $44.0 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017 primarily due to declines in the power generation and oil, gas, and petrochemical end markets, partially offset by increases in general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $13.6 million on Net sales. Gross profit increased during 2018, reflecting acquisition-related growth of $44.7 million and a positive foreign currency translation impact of $3.9 million. Gross profit margin improved 110 basis points during 2018, reflecting positive impacts of acquisitions, savings from previously executed restructuring initiatives, improved project execution and favorable change in project mix driven by our aftermarket initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due to $41.0 million acquisition-related growth and foreign currency translation impact of $4.2 million partially offset by a $7.1 million gain on sale of facility recognized in the first quarter of 2018. Restructuring and other related charges decreased during 2018 as certain projects to eliminate excess cost in response to the change in market conditions in late 2017 were completed.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.0 million and the Provision for income taxes was $42.6 million for 2017. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2017 was (355.0)%, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to non-deductible impairment losses, losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized offset in part by foreign earnings where international tax rates that are lower than the 2017 U.S. tax rate. The Tax Act provisional amounts did not have a significant net impact on the effective tax rate for 2017. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $206.5 million and the Provision for income taxes was $51.8 million for 2016, resulting in a 25.1% effective tax rate that was primarily driven by foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. federal tax rate.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $35.2 million and $31.5 million as of\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, certain Colfax non-U.S. subsidiaries conducted business involving Iran authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC\u201d) under General License H and Sec. 560.537 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctioned Regulations ( ITSR\u201d). General License H authorized U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities to engage in certain business involving Iran and Sec. 560.537 authorized the wind down of such business on or before November 4, 2018.\nThis acquisition is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019. The related bank, senior notes and equity financing for the acquisition was completed in February 2019. The DJO acquisition represents a strategic evolution of Colfax that creates a new growth platform in the high-margin orthopedic solutions market.\nIn certain contracts, particularly within the Air and Gas Handling segment, we are engaged to engineer and build highly-customized, large-scale products and systems. In these circumstances, we produce an asset with no alternative use and have a right to payment for performance completed to date. As a result, revenue is recognized over time based on progress to date. To measure progress, we use an input method based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. Under this method, contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract. The amount recognized is directly proportionate to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. This method requires estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition. Significant management judgments and estimates, including estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized during each period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available. The revisions are recorded in income in the period in which they are determined using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.\n (1) Variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of 3.92%. \nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily includes net cash outflows related to asbestos claims of $5.6 million. Cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was $65.2 million and $23.1 million, respectively during 2017 and 2016. Cash used in or provided by our discontinued operations is included in net cash provided by operating activities above. Cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations, which is included in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities above, was $10.1 million and $3.9 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nThe following discussion of Results of Operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented. Our management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and Segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income before Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, and Restructuring and other related charges.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code which included how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. Key changes in the Tax Act which are relevant to us and generally effective January 1, 2018 include a flat corporate income tax rate of 21 percent to replace the marginal rates that range from 15 percent to 35 percent, elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax, the creation of a territorial tax system replacing the worldwide tax system, a one-time tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings ( Transition Tax\u201d) to transition to the territorial system, a minimum tax\u201d on certain foreign earnings above an enumerated rate of return, a new base erosion anti-abuse tax that subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to its foreign subsidiary to additional taxes, and an incentive for U.S. companies to sell, lease or license goods and services outside the U.S. by taxing the income at a reduced effective rate. The new tax also imposes limits on executive compensation and interest expense deductions, while permitting the immediate expensing for the cost of new investments in certain property acquired after September 27, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet sales from continuing operations increased from $3.2 billion in 2016 to $3.3 billion in 2017 and to $3.7 billion in 2018. The following table presents the components of changes in consolidated Net sales from continuing operations and, for our Air and Gas Handling segment, orders and order backlog:\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance, we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nAsbestos Liabilities and Insurance Assets\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, Colfax is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, including certain activities involving Iran.\nOn February 5, 2019, CFX Escrow Corporation issued two tranches of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600 million (the 2024 Notes\u201d) and $400 million (the 2026 Notes\u201d) to finance a portion of the DJO acquisition. The 2024 Notes are due on February 5, 2024 and have an interest rate of 6.0%. The 2026 Notes are due on February 5, 2026 and have an interest rate of 6.375%. Upon closing of the acquisition, we will assume all of CFX Escrow Corporation's obligations under the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes and each tranche of notes will be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.\nDuring 2018, we completed two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment for an aggregate net cash consideration of $35.9 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. These acquisitions expanded our technology and service offering for mining ventilation applications.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment charges totaling $152.7 million. These charges consisted of a goodwill impairment of $150.2 million and an indefinite-lived trademark impairment charge of $2.5 million. Both charges related to our Air and Gas Handling segment. Additionally, we incurred a $46.9 million non-cash pension settlement loss in connection with a third-party buyout of one of our pension plans.\nDuring the annual impairment analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017, quantitative analyses were performed, as of September 30, 2017 for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit trade names due to continued declines in various end markets. The analyses determined the fair value was lower than carrying value for one trade name, which resulted in an impairment charge of $2.5 million for that trade name. The calculated fair value of the trade name was $11.7 million and is included in Level Three of the fair value hierarchy. For another indefinite-lived intangible trade name, the analysis determined the fair value was marginally greater than its $22.1 million carrying value. A qualitative assessment was performed for the Fabrication Technology reporting unit trade names for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which indicated no impairment existed.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DJO Global Inc. ( DJO\u201d) for $3.2 billion in cash. DJO is a global developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-quality medical devices with a broad range of products used for orthopedic\nProjecting future asbestos-related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict, including, among others, the number of claims that might be received, the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the financial resources of other companies that are co-defendants in the claims, funds available in post-bankruptcy trusts, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards, including potential tort reform. Furthermore, any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. These trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability, and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods. Accordingly, we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assess whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate. Taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties, we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next 15 years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate. While it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period, we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years. Defense costs associated with asbestos-related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries' insurers are expensed as incurred.\nIntegral to our operations is CBS. CBS is our business management system, including a comprehensive set of tools. It includes repeatable, teachable processes that we use to drive continuous improvement and create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. We believe that our management team's access to, and experience in, the application of the CBS methodology is one of our primary competitive strengths.\nOverview\nWe have projected future asbestos-related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the Nicholson methodology. The Nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts. This methodology is based upon risk equations, exposed population estimates, mortality rates, and other demographic statistics. In applying the Nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed: (1) an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos; (2) a review of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos-related diseases in each year; (3) an analysis of the subsidiaries' recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases and (4) an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values, which vary by disease type, jurisdiction and the nature\ninternational tax rates that are lower than the 2017 U.S. tax rate. The Tax Act provisional amounts did not have a significant net impact on the effective tax rate for 2017.\nInterest expense during 2017 increased by $10.8 million compared to 2016, primarily attributable to the senior note offering of \u20ac350 million in April 2017 and higher interest rates on our senior unsecured debt.\nasbestos and other legal claims, employee benefit plan obligations, deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors, including the type of product, the location in which the product is manufactured, the end market for which the product is designed, and the percentage of total revenue represented by aftermarket sales and services, which tend to often have higher margins than foremarket products and consumables.\nWe believe that we are well positioned to grow our businesses organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base. Our current business mix is expected to be well balanced between long- and short-cycle businesses, sales in emerging markets and developed nations and foremarket and aftermarket products and services. Given this balance, management does not use indices other than general economic trends and business initiatives to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Instead, our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and outlook for the future.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs our air and gas handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year, historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July, August and December vacation seasons. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn the evaluation of Goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the reporting entity's fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that entity. In certain instances, we may elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired. Pursuant to ASU 2017-04, which we elected to adopt during the three months ended December 31, 2017, if the carrying value of the reporting unit's Goodwill is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nRaw Material Costs\nFabrication Technology\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our Air and Gas Handling segment:\nWe provide a variety of products and services to our customers. Most of our contracts consist of a single, distinct performance obligation or promise to transfer goods or services to a customer. For contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nThe $103.3 million increase in Gross profit during 2018 in comparison to 2017 was attributable to an increase of $57.8 million in our Fabrication Technology segment and $45.6 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Acquisitions contributed $87.9 million of gross profit and restructuring initiatives added $19.9 million when compared to 2017. The positive impact of acquisitions and restructuring benefits was partially offset by lower sales volume in the Air and Gas Handling segment. Gross profit margin for 2018 included the effect in our Fabrication Technology segment of higher customer prices for certain products to offset input cost inflation, which commensurately increased both Net sales and Cost of sales and compressed total company Gross profit margin by 80 basis points.\nWe expect strategic acquisitions, such as our pending acquisition of DJO, to contribute to our growth. In the short-term, we\nbracing, reconstructive implants, rehabilitation, pain management and physical therapy. Its products address the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to rehabilitation after surgery, injury or from degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion. DJO currently develops, manufactures and distributes its products through the following two markets: Prevention & Rehabilitation and Reconstructive.\nA significant portion of our Net sales, approximately 76% for 2018, is derived from operations outside the U.S., with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the U.S., a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion. Changes in\n \u2022 During 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash payments of $51.4 million, $30.7 million and $66.6 million, respectively, were made related to our restructuring initiatives. \nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in working capital and the timing of payments for items such as pension funding, asbestos-related costs and restructuring program funding. Changes in significant operating cash flow items are discussed below.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment charges totaling $152.7 million. These charges consisted of a goodwill impairment of $150.2 million and an indefinite-lived trademark impairment charge of $2.5 million. Both charges related to our Air and Gas Handling segment. Additionally, we incurred a $46.9 million non-cash pension settlement loss in connection with a third-party buyout of one of our pension plans.\nOn February 5, 2019, CFX Escrow Corporation issued two tranches of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600 million (the 2024 Notes\u201d) and $400 million (the 2026 Notes\u201d). Upon closing of the DJO acquisition, we will assume all of CFX Escrow Corporation's obligations under the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes. See Note 12, Debt\u201d for further information.\nOn April 19, 2017, we issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac350 million (the Euro Notes\u201d). The Euro Notes are due on April 15, 2025 and have an interest rate of 3.25%. The proceeds from the Euro Notes offering were used to repay borrowings under our DB Credit Agreement and bilateral credit facilities totaling \u20ac283.5 million, as well as for general corporate purposes, and are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.\nOur products and services are available worldwide. The manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region. During 2018, approximately 77% of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world. Our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations, including efficiently utilizing our global sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, participating in the expansion of market opportunities in emerging markets, successfully completing global strategic acquisitions and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets. However, we believe that our geographic, end market, customer and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results.\nWe face a number of challenges and opportunities, including the successful integration of new acquisitions, application and expansion of our CBS tools to improve margins and working capital management, and rationalization of assets and costs.\n \u2022 Changes in net working capital also affected the operating cash flows for the periods presented. We define working capital as Trade receivables, net and Inventories, net reduced by Accounts payable and Customer advances and billings in excess of costs incurred. During 2018, net working capital consumed cash of $31.0 million, before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventories driven by revenue growth. The net increase was offset by an increase in both payables and customer advances and billings in excess of costs. During 2017, net working capital consumed cash of $92.5 million, before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventories driven by revenue growth and timing of collections and shipments. During 2016, net working capital consumed cash of $31.4 million, before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to an increase in receivables and lower billings \nColfax conducts its operations through two operating segments: Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology.\nin excess of costs incurred associated with our Air and Gas business segment. The net increase was offset by an increase in payables in our Air and Gas Handling segment and Fabrication Technology segment and partially offset by decline in inventory levels in our Fabrication Technology segment.\nIn 2016, we experienced a concurrent decline in numerous end-markets and geographic markets that negatively impacted both of our reporting units. We elected not to perform qualitative assessments of Goodwill and instead, proceeded directly to performing the first step of quantitative Goodwill impairment test for its 2016 annual impairment test. The quantitative impairment assessment of Goodwill for each of the Fabrication Technology and Air and Gas Handling reporting units, based on the methodologies identified above, resulted in calculated fair values that exceeded the carrying values for both reporting units. As such, no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the annual Goodwill impairment analysis performed as of October 1, 2016.\nDuring 2018, we completed two acquisitions in the Fabrication Technology segment for net cash consideration of $245.1 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. This includes the acquisition of Gas Control Equipment (GCE) in the fourth quarter for cash consideration of $207.0 million. This acquisition expanded our technology and service offering for specialty gas applications.\nTotal Company\nThe initial credit extensions under the New Credit Facility will only be made available to us, subject to certain conditions precedent, on the date of consummation of the DJO acquisition. The proceeds of such initial credit extensions shall be used on such date (i) to replace the commitments, and repay in full amounts outstanding, under the DB Credit Agreement, (ii) to pay a portion of the consideration in connection with the DJO acquisition, and (iii) for fees and expenses related to the foregoing. Following the consummation of the DJO acquisition, credit extensions under the New Revolver will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $245.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $17.0 million from $262.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the change in Cash and cash equivalents during the periods indicated:\nASC 740 requires changes in tax rates and tax laws to be accounted for in the period of enactment in continuing operations. Accordingly, of significance, we included a provisional estimate of approximately $52 million for the Transition Tax, payable over 8 years for our year ended December 31, 2017. Pursuant to SAB 118, we reduced our provisional amount for Transition Tax by $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Generally, the foreign earnings subject to the Transition Tax can be distributed without additional U.S. tax; however, if distributed, the amount could be subject to foreign taxes and U.S. state and local taxes. We continue to maintain its indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nPlease see Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d for a discussion of Colfax's objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value.\n2022 Tangible Equity Units\nforeign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on Net sales and Income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Changes in foreign exchange rates since December 31, 2017 decreased net assets by approximately 7%.\nCash flows provided by investing activities during 2018 included $18.4 million of cash and $139.5 million in proceeds from the sale of CIRCOR common stock related to the 2017 sale of our Fluid Handling business. Cash flows used in investing activities during the 2018 were mainly associated with two acquisition in our Fabrication Technology segment and two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment totaling net cash outflows of $290.9 million. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2017 included net proceeds of $490.3 million from the sale of the Fluid Handling business and net cash outflows of $346.8 million associated with two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment and three acquisitions in our Fabrication Technology segment.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DJO for $3.2 billion in cash. We are financing this acquisition, in part, by (1) entering into the New Credit Facility (as described below in this section); (2) an offering for $460 million of tangible equity units; and (3) an offering for $1 billion of senior unsecured notes (the 2024 Notes\u201d and 2026 Notes\u201d). See Note 12, Debt\u201d and Note 20 Subsequent Events\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nDemand for our products depends in part on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. While demand can be cyclical, we believe that our diversified operations generally limit the impact of a downturn in any one market on our consolidated results. Since the second half of 2017, declines in activity in the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets impacted our Air and Gas Handling segment. These declines reduced the levels of capital invested and maintenance expenditures made by certain of our customers, which in turn has reduced the demand for our products and services. During 2018, our Air and Gas Handling segment has strategically focused on initiatives to grow general industrial end markets, which has helped offset the impacts from the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets.\nBusiness Segments\nOn December 17, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Facility\u201d) by and among the Company, as the borrower, certain of our U.S. subsidiaries identified therein, as guarantors, each of the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, as syndication agent, and the co-documentation agents named therein. The New Credit Facility consists of a revolving credit facility which totals $1.3 billion in commitments (the New Revolver\u201d) and a Term A-1 loan in an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion (the Five Year Term Loan\u201d), each of which matures in five years, and a Term A-2 loan in an aggregate amount of $500 million, which matures in two years (the Two Year Term Loan\u201d and, together with the Five Year Term Loan, the New Term Loan Facilities\u201d). The New Revolver contains a $50 million swing line loan sub-facility.\nWe are also party to letter of credit facilities with an aggregate capacity of $757.4 million. Total letters of credit of $344.1 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nOn October 11, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which were to be retired upon repurchase. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our Common stock in open market transactions for $20.8 million. The repurchase program expired as of December 31, 2016. See Note 13, Equity\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe 13.2% Net sales increase during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of an increase in existing businesses of $171.5 million with continued growth in most markets and acquisition-related growth of $119.6 million. Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $35.3 million on Net sales. The growth rate from existing businesses included 4.8% from increased customer prices to address higher material and inflation costs, and 4.1% from higher volumes. The increase in Gross profit during 2018 is driven by the acquisition-related growth of $43.2 million and increased sales volumes. Gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to the dilutive effect of input cost inflation being addressed by higher customer prices for certain products. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $32.2 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily driven by an $33.2 million acquisition-related increase and higher costs to support growth initiatives, offset by a $10.9 million net benefit from facility sales in the fourth quarter. Restructuring and other related items increased in 2018 in comparison to 2017, as a result of expanded cost reduction programs.\nDuring 2017, we completed three acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $128.3 million. These acquisitions broadened our product offering and technology content.\nContractual Obligations\nA majority of the revenue we recognize relates to contracts with customers for standard or off-the-shelf products. As control typically transfers to the customer upon shipment of the product in these circumstances, revenue is generally recognized at that point in time. For service contracts, we recognize revenue ratably over the period of performance as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services provided.\nOverview\nSee Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our asbestos liabilities and insurance assets.\nOutlook\n \u2022 Fabrication Technology - a global supplier of consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting, joining and automated welding of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys \nEconomic Conditions\nDB Credit Agreement\nThe proceeds of the loans under the DB Credit Agreement were used by us to repay in full balances under our preexisting credit agreement, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DB Credit Agreement consists of a term loan in the aggregate amount of $750.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) with a commitment capacity of $1.3 billion, each of which had an initial maturity term of five years. The Revolver contains a $50.0 million swing line loan sub-facility. See Note 12, Debt\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nWe assessed the subsidiaries' existing insurance arrangements and agreements, estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims, analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness and solvency of the various insurers, and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities. The analysis took into account self-insurance retentions, policy exclusions, pending litigation, liability caps and gaps in coverage, existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies.\nThe decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to decreases of $74.7 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment, mostly offset by an increase of $59.0 million in our Fabrication Technology segment. Air and Gas Handling orders, net of cancellations and excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects, decreased $44.1 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016 due to large project bookings during the second half of 2016 that did not repeat, delays in orders in the second half of 2017, and lower demand in power generation markets. The decline was partially offset by increases in general industrial and other end markets.\nAir and Gas Handling\nCertain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d\n (2) Excludes open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which is not certain. \nPension obligations and other post-retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions, including the discount rate, assumed annual rates of return on plan assets, and per capita cost of covered health care benefits. Changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post-retirement expense recognized in future periods. These assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions. See Note 15, Defined Benefit Plans\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nNew Term Loan Facilities and New Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Loss on short term investments of $10.1 million during 2018 was due to the change in fair value and subsequent sale of the CIRCOR Shares received in connection with the Fluid Handling business sale.\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n2024 Notes and 2026 Notes\nWe sold our Fluid Handling business to CIRCOR International ( CIRCOR\u201d), Inc., a Delaware corporation on December 11, 2017. Pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) signed on September 24, 2017, we retained the asbestos-related contingencies and insurance coverages. However, as we did not retain an interest in the ongoing operations of the business subject to the contingencies, we have classified asbestos-related activity in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of Income (loss) from discontinuing operations, net of taxes. See Note 4, Discontinued Operations\u201d for further information.\nGenerally, we measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows and a market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow models indicate the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future. Significant estimates in the discounted cash flow models include: the weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison against certain market information. Significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nThe increase in Net sales from existing businesses during 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to sales from both acquisitions and existing businesses. Net sales from acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment and Fabrication Technology segment were $141.2 million and $119.6 million, respectively. Net sales from existing businesses increased $171.5 million in our Fabrication Technology segment and decreased $44.0 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Fluctuation of foreign currency translation rates had a negative impact on Net sales of $21.7 million during the year. Air and Gas Handling orders increased by $129.9 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017; orders excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects decreased $30.3 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in the power generation end market, and a $20 million cancellation during the second quarter of 2018 due to newly-implemented restrictions implemented by the U.S. government.\nIn the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying value, a calculation is performed and compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We measure the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty\u201d method. Significant estimates in this approach include projected revenues and royalty and discount rates for each trade name evaluated.", "item_7_text": "Global Operations\nWe complement our organic growth plans with strategic acquisitions. Acquisitions can significantly affect our reported results, and we report the change in our Net sales between periods both from existing and acquired businesses. Orders and order backlog are presented only for the longer-cycle Air and Gas Handling segment, where this information is relevant. The change in Net sales due to acquisitions for the periods presented in this filing represents the incremental sales from acquired businesses.\nAs discussed further above, we report results in two reportable segments: Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology.\nAir and Gas Handling Business\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers,\u201d which we adopted on January 1, 2018, using the full retrospective method. We recognize revenue when control of promised goods or services is transferred to the customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring the goods or services. The nature of our contracts gives rise to certain types of variable consideration, including rebates, liquidated damages, and other discounts. We include estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price to the extent that it is probable there will not be a significant reversal of revenue. Estimates are based on historical or anticipated performance and represent our best judgment at the time. Any estimates are evaluated on a quarterly basis until the uncertainty is resolved.\nOur financial performance and growth are driven by many factors, principally our ability to serve global markets, fluctuations in the relationship of foreign currencies to the U.S. dollar, general economic market conditions, the global economy and capital spending levels, the availability of capital, our estimates concerning asbestos litigation expense and liabilities and availability of insurance thereto, the impact of restructuring initiatives, our ability to pass cost increases on to customers through pricing, the impact of sales mix, our ability to continue to grow through acquisitions, and other factors. These key factors have impacted our results of operations in the past and are likely to affect them in the future.\nIn addition to the debt agreements discussed above, we are party to various bilateral credit facilities with a borrowing capacity of $271.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, outstanding borrowings under these facilities totaled $71.0 million, with a weighted average borrowing rate of 3.59%.\n\nDue to continued declines in various end markets for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit, we performed a quantitative analysis for this reporting unit as of September 29, 2018 and September 30, 2017 as part of our annual goodwill impairment testing. In 2017, the quantitative Goodwill impairment assessment for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit resulted in a calculated fair value lower than carrying value. As a result, an impairment charge of $150.2 million, which equals the excess of the carrying value over the fair value, was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017. In 2018, the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit resulted in a carrying value lower than the calculated fair value. As a result, no impairment existed. A qualitative assessment of Goodwill was performed for the Fabrication Technology reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which indicated no impairment existed.\nRecent Developments\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nConcurrent with our announcement of the DJO acquisition, we also announced that we are exploring strategic options for the Air and Gas Handling business including a potential divestiture. We have hired an advisor to assist in the process but cannot predict the outcome.\n\n(1) Represents contracts for products or services, net of current year cancellations for orders placed in the current and prior periods.\nDue to changes in market multiples, weighted average cost of capital and, to a lesser extent, declines in certain end markets for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2018, we decided to perform a quantitative analysis for this reporting unit as of September 29, 2018. The quantitative analysis resulted in a calculated fair value that was higher than the reporting unit's carrying value by 9%. As a result, no impairment charges were recorded.\nThe mix of sales was as follows for the periods presented:\n\nItems Affecting Comparability of Reported Results\nOperating Results\nGiven the nature of these long-term contracts, we are often paid at various points throughout the process, based on the contractual terms. We apply the available practical expedient involving the existence of a significant financing component. As we generally do not receive payments greater than one year in advance or arrears of revenue recognition, we do not consider any arrangements to include financing components.\nEach subsidiary has separate insurance coverage acquired prior to our ownership of each independent entity. In our evaluation of the insurance asset, we use differing insurance allocation methodologies for each subsidiary based upon the applicable law pertaining to the affected subsidiary.\n(2) Excludes the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, thus providing a measure of growth due to factors such as price, product mix and volume.\n\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ( MD&A\u201d) is designed to provide a reader of our financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of Company's management. This MD&A is divided into four main sections:\nWe evaluate the recoverability of Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying amount. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered to be impaired when the carrying value of a reporting unit or asset exceeds its value.\nPrior Disclosure Under Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act\nOn December 22, 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 ( SAB 118\u201d) to address the application of U.S. GAAP in situations when a registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 allows registrants to include a provisional amount to account for the implications of the Tax Act where a reasonable estimate can be made and requires the completion of the accounting no later than one year from the date of enactment of the Tax Act or December 22, 2018. We filed our 2017 U.S. income tax return in the fourth quarter of 2018, which changed our tax basis in temporary differences and Transition Tax estimated as of December 31, 2017, resulting in an adjustment to the tax provision to the re-measurement amount recorded in the financial statements.\nImpairment charges related to Goodwill and Indefinite-lived intangible assets are included in Goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInterest expense during 2018 increased by $3.0 million compared to 2017, primarily attributable to higher interest rates on our senior unsecured debt.\nOn January 11, 2019, we issued $460 million in tangible equity units. We offered 4 million of its 5.75% tangible equity units at the stated amount of $100 per unit. An option to purchase up to an additional 600,000 tangible equity units at the stated amount of $100 per unit was exercised in full at settlement. Total cash of $447.7 million was received upon closing, comprised of $377.8 million prepaid stock purchase contracts and $69.9 million of senior amortizing notes due January 2022. The proceeds will be used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the DJO acquisition and for general corporate purposes. If the DJO acquisition does not close by May 19, 2019, we will have the option to exercise certain redemption rights. Unless the 4.6 million stock purchase contracts are redeemed by us or settled earlier at the unit holder's option, they are mandatorily convertible into shares of our common stock at not less than 4.0 shares per purchase contract or more than 4.8054 shares per purchase contract on January 15, 2022. This corresponds to not less than 18.4 million shares and not more than 22.1 million shares at the maximum.\nThe continuation of a sustained decline in our end-markets and geographic markets could increase the risk of impairments in future years. Actual results could differ from our estimates and projections, which would also affect the assessment of impairment. As of December 31, 2018, we have Goodwill of $2.6 billion and indefinite lived trade names of $383.8 million that are subject to at least annual review for impairment. See Note 9, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results from continuing operations for the comparable three year period.\nOther Indebtedness\nThe Net sales increase during 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of an increase in existing businesses of $59.0 million, led by a market recovery in North America and growth in certain developing regions. Acquisition-related growth contributed $48.1 million of incremental sales in 2017, and foreign currency translation had a positive impact of $29.7 million. Gross profit increased in 2017 due to acquisition-related growth of $23.4 million and increases in volumes from existing businesses. Costs savings associated with restructuring programs added another $8.2 million of additional gross profit in the current year. These increases were partially offset by a $38.6 million increase in cost of goods sold due to higher commodity prices in 2017. Gross margin increased 20 basis points due to the positive impact from increased volumes and favorable mix, which was partially offset by higher raw material costs during the year. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $20.6 million in 2017 as compared to 2016 and was primarily attributable to a $17.9 million increase in acquisition-related cost. Segment operating income margin expanded approximately 80 basis points due to higher sales and improved profit margin. Restructuring and other related items decreased in 2017 in comparison to 2016, consistent with management's plan.\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances could be required.\n \u2022 Funding requirements of our defined benefit plans, including pension plans and other post-retirement benefit plans, can vary significantly from period to period due to changes in the fair value of plan assets and actuarial assumptions. For 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash contributions for defined benefit plans were $36.3 million, $37.9 million and $34.5 million, respectively. \nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $35.5 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016, which was attributable to increases in both Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology. The increases were mainly driven by $28.3 million increases associated with acquisitions completed in 2017, a $14.2 million increase in business development related expenses, partially offset by the incremental benefits realized from our restructuring programs and cost savings initiatives. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2017 compared to 2016, driven by accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess cost in response to the current market conditions.\nwill focus on reducing leverage levels associated with financing for the DJO acquisition. We believe that the extensive experience of our leadership team in acquiring and effectively integrating acquisition targets should enable us to capitalize on future opportunities.\nForeign Currency Fluctuations\nManagement's analyses are based on currently known facts and a number of assumptions. However, projecting future events, such as new claims to be filed each year, the average cost of resolving each claim, coverage issues among layers of insurers, the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies, interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships, the continuing solvency of various insurance companies, the amount of remaining insurance available, as well as the numerous uncertainties inherent in asbestos litigation could cause the actual liabilities and insurance recoveries to be higher or lower than those projected or recorded which could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe currently intend to repay the existing Term Loan Facility and the Revolver with the proceeds of the New Credit Facility (as defined below), at which time the Term Loan Facility and Revolver will be terminated.\n(3) Represents the incremental sales, orders and order backlog as a result of our acquisitions discussed previously.\nWe have financed our capital and working capital requirements through a combination of cash flows from operating activities, various borrowings and issuances of equity. We expect that our primary ongoing requirements for cash will be for current and projected debt service requirements, working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, asbestos-related expenses and funding of pension plans and restructuring programs. If determined appropriate for strategic acquisitions or other corporate purposes, we believe we could raise additional funds in the form of debt or equity. As of December 31, 2018, we had $1.2 billion of outstanding indebtedness. We are also party to letter of credit facilities with total capacity of $757.4 million, of which $344.1 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nOn February 12, 2018, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100 million of our Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The Board of Directors increased the repurchase authorization by an additional $100 million on June 6, 2018, and again for an additional $100 million on July 19, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, the remaining stock repurchase authorization provided by our Board of Directors was $100.0 million.\nThe $37.1 million increase in Gross profit during 2017 in comparison to 2016 was attributable to an increase of $49.6 million in our Fabrication Technology segment, partially offset by a decline of $12.5 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Acquisition-related growth in both segments contributed $32.1 million of Gross profit in 2017, and foreign exchange translation added another $14.0 million to the increase. These increases combined with $26.8 million of savings from restructuring initiatives, helped offset the impact of lower new build project margins and higher material costs experienced in 2017, keeping Gross profit margin consistent with the prior year.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the weighted-average interest rate of borrowings under the DB Credit Agreement was 3.92%, excluding accretion of original issue discount and deferred financing fees, and there was $1.1 billion available on the revolving credit facility.\nCash flows used in financing activities for 2018 were impacted by the repurchase of 6.4 million shares of our Common stock for $200.0 million, partially offset by $158.2 million of proceeds from borrowings. The outflow in 2017 is attributable to the repayment of borrowings under the DB credit agreement and bilateral credit facilities for $651.8 million, reduced by proceeds from the issuance of Euro Notes. The cash outflows in 2016 were due to repayment of borrowings under the DB credit agreement and bilateral credit facilities of $118.8 million and share repurchases of $20.8 million.\n(4) Represents the difference between prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at the actual prior year foreign exchange rates and prior year sales, orders and order backlog valued at current year foreign exchange rates.\nSales and Cost Mix\nIn October 2018, a non-U.S. Howden subsidiary in the Czech Republic sold a control system valued at $57,083 for end use in the Iranian petrochemical sector pursuant to Sec. 560.537. The sale did not generate a profit. The information provided pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act in Item 5 of Part II of the Company's Quarterly Reports on 10-Q for the quarter ended June 29, 2018 is also hereby incorporated by reference. In compliance with the revocation of General License H and the expiration of Sec. 560.537, we do not intend to continue these activities.\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased by $85.9 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017. The increase was mainly driven by a $74.2 million increase associated with acquisitions completed in 2018 in both Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology segments. Additionally, $6.6 million of acquisition-related costs were incurred during 2018 mainly related to the DJO acquisition.\nCash Flows\nThe New Term Loan Facilities and the New Revolver will bear interest, at our election, at either the base rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility) or the Eurocurrency rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility), in each case, plus the applicable interest rate margin. See Note 12, Debt\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome from continuing operations before income taxes was $182.8 million with a slight income tax benefit for 2018. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2018 was 0.0%, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to a reduction in Tax Act related amounts originally provided for in the year ended December 31, 2017, U.S. R&D and foreign tax credits, the realization of deferred tax assets that previously had valuation allowances and the net favorable reduction of uncertain tax positions. These favorable items were offset in part by losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized and permanent adjustments in an international jurisdiction. Loss from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.0 million and the Provision for income taxes was $42.6 million for 2017. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2017 was (355.0)%, which was lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to non-deductible impairment losses, losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized offset in part by foreign earnings where\nWe have a global footprint, with production facilities in Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Australia and Africa. Through our reportable segments, we serve a global customer base across multiple markets through a combination of direct sales and third-party distribution channels. Our customer base is highly diversified and includes commercial, industrial and government customers.\n\u2022Overview\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have in the past divested certain of its businesses and assets. In connection with these divestitures, certain representations, warranties and indemnities were made to purchasers to cover various risks or unknown liabilities. We cannot estimate the potential liability, if any, that may result from such representations, warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown and unexpected contingencies; however, we do not believe that any such liabilities will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\n \u2022 Net cash received or paid for asbestos-related costs, net of insurance proceeds, including the disposition of claims, defense costs and legal expenses related to litigation against our insurers, creates variability in our operating cash flows. We had net cash outflows of $5.6 million, $3.7 million and $16.0 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash outflows for 2018 and 2017 were net of $57.0 million and $63.9 million, respectively, of reimbursements from insurance companies on our asbestos insurance receivable. \nGoodwill represents the costs in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired associated with our acquisitions. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names.\nFabrication Technology\nSeasonality\nEuro Notes\nAny recognized revenues in excess of customer billings are recorded as a component of Trade receivables. Billings to customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as a component of Customer advances and billings in excess of costs incurred. For long-term contracts, amounts are billed as work progresses, based on the specified timeline included in the contractual terms. Each contract is evaluated individually to determine the net asset or net liability position. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, there were $168.3 million and $203.9 million, respectively, of revenues in excess of billings and $68.1 million and $94.2 million, respectively, of billings in excess of revenues on long-term contracts in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets. For contracts recognized at a point in time, revenue recognition and billing typically occur simultaneously.\n\u2022Results of Operations\n \u2022 Air and Gas Handling - a global supplier of industrial centrifugal and axial fans, rotary heat exchangers, gas compressors, ventilation control systems and software, and aftermarket services; and \nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our Fabrication Technology segment:\nResults of Operations\nThe annual impairment analysis performed as of October 1, 2016 for indefinite-lived intangible assets resulted in no impairment charges.\n\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that provide liquidity, capital resources, market or credit risk support that expose us to any liability that is not reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements at December 31, 2018 other than outstanding letters of credit of $344.1 million, unconditional purchase obligations with suppliers of $274.3 million, and $138.0 million of future operating lease payments.\nIn total, as of December 31, 2018, we had an original issue discount of $1.5 million and deferred financing fees of $6.9 million included in its Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, which will be accreted to Interest expense primarily using the effective interest method, over the life of the applicable debt.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNet sales from existing businesses decreased by $74.7 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016 primarily due to declines in the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets, partially offset by increases in mining and general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, acquisition-related growth contributed $37.1 million, and changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $15.2 million on Net sales. Gross profit and Gross profit margin decreased during 2017, which was primarily the result of lower volumes and project margins. These decreases were partially offset by $8.6 million of acquisition-related growth and $18.6 million incremental benefits realized from restructuring programs and cost savings initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2017 compared to 2016, which is mainly the result of acquisition-related increases of $10.4 million. The lower Segment operating income and Segment operating income margin in 2017 compared to 2016 were the result of lower Gross profit and the increase in Selling, general and administrative expense discussed above. Restructuring and other related charges increased during 2017 driven by accelerated cost reduction programs to eliminate excess cost in response to the current market conditions. In 2017, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $150.2 million and a trade name impairment charge of $2.5 million, as a result of conclusions reached from performing our annual impairment tests.\nThe following MD&A should be read together with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d, Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K. The MD&A includes forward-looking statements. For a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results referred to in these forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nSales, Orders and Backlog\nof claim, to determine an estimate of costs likely to be associated with currently pending and projected asbestos claims. Our projections, based upon the Nicholson methodology, estimate both claims and the estimated cash outflows related to the resolution of such claims for periods up to and including the endpoint of asbestos studies referred to in item (2) above. It is our policy to record a liability for asbestos-related liability costs for the longest period of time that we can reasonably estimate. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years.\nDuring 2017, we completed two acquisitions in this segment for an aggregate purchase price of $219.6 million. This includes the acquisition of Siemens Turbomachinery Equipment GmbH (STE) from Siemens AG in the fourth quarter for cash consideration of $214.6 million. This acquisition broadened the segment's range of compression solutions and expanded its product offering into smaller steam turbines, and expands our end markets and product portfolio in environmental and industrial markets worldwide.\nWe believe our customers place a premium on quality, reliability, availability, design and application engineering support. Our results may be sensitive to price movements in our raw materials. Our largest material purchases are for components and raw materials including steel, iron, copper and aluminum. Historically, we have been generally successful in passing raw material price increases on to our customers. While we seek to take actions to manage this risk, future changes in component and raw material costs may adversely impact earnings.\nFor detailed information regarding recently issued accounting pronouncements and the expected impact on our financial statements, see Note 3, Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Form 10-K.\nWe have funding requirements associated with our pension and other post-retirement benefit plans as of December 31, 2018, which are estimated to be $14.4 million for the year ending December 31, 2019. Other long-term liabilities, such as those for\nOur Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 included $242.0 million held in jurisdictions outside the U.S. We currently do not intend nor foresee a need to repatriate these funds. If however, we elect to repatriate future earnings from foreign jurisdictions, such repatriation remittances may be subject to taxes and other local statutory restrictions.\nDuring 2016, we deployed approximately $26 million to acquire a business that increased the segment's product and technology offerings.\nDuring 2018, Argentina became a highly inflationary economy, resulting in the remeasurement of our Argentinian operations into Brazilian real, the functional currency of the Argentinian entity's direct parent. Gains and losses from the re-measurement are reflected in current earnings. Future impacts to earnings of applying highly inflationary accounting for Argentina on our Consolidated Financial Statements will be dependent upon movements in the applicable exchange rates. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, the Argentina operation represented less than 2% of our Total assets and Net sales. The devaluation of the peso resulted in a loss of $2.5 million recognized in the Fabrication Technology segment operating income during 2018.\n\nAcquisition of DJO\nEquity Capital\nAccounting Standards Codification 740, Income Taxes\u201d prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a position taken in a tax return. Under this standard, we must presume the income tax position will be examined by a relevant tax authority and determine whether it is more likely than not that the income tax position will be sustained upon examination based on its technical merits. An income tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is then measured to determine the amount of the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. Liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits are reviewed periodically and are adjusted as events occur that affect our estimates, such as the availability of new information, the lapsing of applicable statutes of limitations, the conclusion of tax audits and, if applicable, the conclusion of any court proceedings. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the (Benefit) provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, including accrued interest and penalties, were $37.6 million as of December 31, 2018 and are included in Other liabilities or as a reduction to deferred tax assets in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAir and Gas Handling\nThe period of benefit for our incremental costs of obtaining a contract would generally have less than a one-year duration; therefore, we apply the practical expedient available and expenses costs to obtain a contract when incurred.\nCertain subsidiaries are each one of many defendants in a large number of lawsuits that claim personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos from products manufactured with components that are alleged to have contained asbestos. Such components were acquired from third-party suppliers, and were not manufactured by any of our subsidiaries nor were the subsidiaries producers or direct suppliers of asbestos. The manufactured products that are alleged to have contained asbestos generally were provided to meet the specifications of the subsidiaries' customers, including the U.S. Navy.\nRetirement Benefits\nNet sales increased by $110.8 million with acquisition-related growth contributing $141.2 million. Net sales from existing businesses, as discussed and defined under Sales, Orders and Backlog\u201d above, decreased by $44.0 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017 primarily due to declines in the power generation and oil, gas, and petrochemical end markets, partially offset by increases in general industrial and other end markets. Additionally, changes in foreign exchange rates had a positive impact of $13.6 million on Net sales. Gross profit increased during 2018, reflecting acquisition-related growth of $44.7 million and a positive foreign currency translation impact of $3.9 million. Gross profit margin improved 110 basis points during 2018, reflecting positive impacts of acquisitions, savings from previously executed restructuring initiatives, improved project execution and favorable change in project mix driven by our aftermarket initiatives. Selling, general and administrative expense increased during 2018 compared to 2017 due to $41.0 million acquisition-related growth and foreign currency translation impact of $4.2 million partially offset by a $7.1 million gain on sale of facility recognized in the first quarter of 2018. Restructuring and other related charges decreased during 2018 as certain projects to eliminate excess cost in response to the change in market conditions in late 2017 were completed.\nLoss from continuing operations before income taxes was $12.0 million and the Provision for income taxes was $42.6 million for 2017. The effective tax rate for continuing operations during 2017 was (355.0)%, which was higher than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate primarily due to non-deductible impairment losses, losses in certain jurisdictions where a tax benefit is not expected to be recognized offset in part by foreign earnings where international tax rates that are lower than the 2017 U.S. tax rate. The Tax Act provisional amounts did not have a significant net impact on the effective tax rate for 2017. Income from continuing operations before income taxes was $206.5 million and the Provision for income taxes was $51.8 million for 2016, resulting in a 25.1% effective tax rate that was primarily driven by foreign earnings where international tax rates are lower than the U.S. federal tax rate.\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. These allowances are based on recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire pool of customers. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $35.2 million and $31.5 million as of\nIn the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, certain Colfax non-U.S. subsidiaries conducted business involving Iran authorized by the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( OFAC\u201d) under General License H and Sec. 560.537 of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctioned Regulations ( ITSR\u201d). General License H authorized U.S.-owned or -controlled foreign entities to engage in certain business involving Iran and Sec. 560.537 authorized the wind down of such business on or before November 4, 2018.\nThis acquisition is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2019. The related bank, senior notes and equity financing for the acquisition was completed in February 2019. The DJO acquisition represents a strategic evolution of Colfax that creates a new growth platform in the high-margin orthopedic solutions market.\nIn certain contracts, particularly within the Air and Gas Handling segment, we are engaged to engineer and build highly-customized, large-scale products and systems. In these circumstances, we produce an asset with no alternative use and have a right to payment for performance completed to date. As a result, revenue is recognized over time based on progress to date. To measure progress, we use an input method based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. Under this method, contract revenues are recognized over the performance period of the contract. The amount recognized is directly proportionate to the costs incurred as a percentage of total estimated costs for the entirety of the contract. This method requires estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition. Significant management judgments and estimates, including estimated costs to complete projects, must be made and used in connection with revenue recognized during each period. Current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available. The revisions are recorded in income in the period in which they are determined using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting.\n (1) Variable interest payments are estimated using a static rate of 3.92%. \nCash used in operating activities of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily includes net cash outflows related to asbestos claims of $5.6 million. Cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations was $65.2 million and $23.1 million, respectively during 2017 and 2016. Cash used in or provided by our discontinued operations is included in net cash provided by operating activities above. Cash used in investing activities of discontinued operations, which is included in net cash (used in) provided by investing activities above, was $10.1 million and $3.9 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n2018 Compared to 2017\nThe following discussion of Results of Operations addresses the comparison of the periods presented. Our management evaluates the operating results of each of its reportable segments based upon Net sales and Segment operating income (loss), which represents Operating income before Goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge, and Restructuring and other related charges.\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Act\u201d) was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code which included how the U.S. imposes income tax on multinational corporations. Key changes in the Tax Act which are relevant to us and generally effective January 1, 2018 include a flat corporate income tax rate of 21 percent to replace the marginal rates that range from 15 percent to 35 percent, elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax, the creation of a territorial tax system replacing the worldwide tax system, a one-time tax on accumulated foreign subsidiary earnings ( Transition Tax\u201d) to transition to the territorial system, a minimum tax\u201d on certain foreign earnings above an enumerated rate of return, a new base erosion anti-abuse tax that subjects certain payments made by a U.S. company to its foreign subsidiary to additional taxes, and an incentive for U.S. companies to sell, lease or license goods and services outside the U.S. by taxing the income at a reduced effective rate. The new tax also imposes limits on executive compensation and interest expense deductions, while permitting the immediate expensing for the cost of new investments in certain property acquired after September 27, 2017.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nNet sales from continuing operations increased from $3.2 billion in 2016 to $3.3 billion in 2017 and to $3.7 billion in 2018. The following table presents the components of changes in consolidated Net sales from continuing operations and, for our Air and Gas Handling segment, orders and order backlog:\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, we take into account various factors, including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance, we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made.\nAsbestos Liabilities and Insurance Assets\nPursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, Colfax is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, including certain activities involving Iran.\nOn February 5, 2019, CFX Escrow Corporation issued two tranches of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600 million (the 2024 Notes\u201d) and $400 million (the 2026 Notes\u201d) to finance a portion of the DJO acquisition. The 2024 Notes are due on February 5, 2024 and have an interest rate of 6.0%. The 2026 Notes are due on February 5, 2026 and have an interest rate of 6.375%. Upon closing of the acquisition, we will assume all of CFX Escrow Corporation's obligations under the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes and each tranche of notes will be guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.\nDuring 2018, we completed two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment for an aggregate net cash consideration of $35.9 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. These acquisitions expanded our technology and service offering for mining ventilation applications.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment charges totaling $152.7 million. These charges consisted of a goodwill impairment of $150.2 million and an indefinite-lived trademark impairment charge of $2.5 million. Both charges related to our Air and Gas Handling segment. Additionally, we incurred a $46.9 million non-cash pension settlement loss in connection with a third-party buyout of one of our pension plans.\nDuring the annual impairment analysis for the year ended December 31, 2017, quantitative analyses were performed, as of September 30, 2017 for the Air and Gas Handling reporting unit trade names due to continued declines in various end markets. The analyses determined the fair value was lower than carrying value for one trade name, which resulted in an impairment charge of $2.5 million for that trade name. The calculated fair value of the trade name was $11.7 million and is included in Level Three of the fair value hierarchy. For another indefinite-lived intangible trade name, the analysis determined the fair value was marginally greater than its $22.1 million carrying value. A qualitative assessment was performed for the Fabrication Technology reporting unit trade names for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which indicated no impairment existed.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DJO Global Inc. ( DJO\u201d) for $3.2 billion in cash. DJO is a global developer, manufacturer and distributor of high-quality medical devices with a broad range of products used for orthopedic\nProjecting future asbestos-related liability costs is subject to numerous variables that are difficult to predict, including, among others, the number of claims that might be received, the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant, the latency period associated with asbestos exposure, dismissal rates, costs of medical treatment, the financial resources of other companies that are co-defendants in the claims, funds available in post-bankruptcy trusts, uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, including fluctuations in the timing of court actions and rulings, and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards, including potential tort reform. Furthermore, any projections with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. These trend factors have both positive and negative effects on the dynamics of asbestos litigation in the tort system and the related best estimate of our asbestos liability, and these effects do not move in linear fashion but rather change over multiple year periods. Accordingly, we monitor these trend factors over time and periodically assess whether an alternative forecast period is appropriate. Taking these factors into account and the inherent uncertainties, we believe that we can reasonably estimate the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims that will be resolved in the next 15 years and have recorded that liability as our best estimate. While it is reasonably possible that the subsidiaries will incur costs after this period, we do not believe the reasonably possible loss or range of reasonably possible loss is estimable at the current time. Accordingly, no accrual has been recorded for any costs which may be paid after the next 15 years. Defense costs associated with asbestos-related liabilities as well as costs incurred related to litigation against the subsidiaries' insurers are expensed as incurred.\nIntegral to our operations is CBS. CBS is our business management system, including a comprehensive set of tools. It includes repeatable, teachable processes that we use to drive continuous improvement and create superior value for our customers, shareholders and associates. Rooted in our core values, it is our culture. We believe that our management team's access to, and experience in, the application of the CBS methodology is one of our primary competitive strengths.\nOverview\nWe have projected future asbestos-related liability costs with regard to pending and future unasserted claims based upon the Nicholson methodology. The Nicholson methodology is a standard approach used by experts and has been accepted by numerous courts. This methodology is based upon risk equations, exposed population estimates, mortality rates, and other demographic statistics. In applying the Nicholson methodology for each subsidiary we performed: (1) an analysis of the estimated population likely to have been exposed or claim to have been exposed to products manufactured by the subsidiaries based upon national studies undertaken of the population of workers believed to have been exposed to asbestos; (2) a review of epidemiological and demographic studies to estimate the number of potentially exposed people that would be likely to develop asbestos-related diseases in each year; (3) an analysis of the subsidiaries' recent claims history to estimate likely filing rates for these diseases and (4) an analysis of the historical asbestos liability costs to develop average values, which vary by disease type, jurisdiction and the nature\ninternational tax rates that are lower than the 2017 U.S. tax rate. The Tax Act provisional amounts did not have a significant net impact on the effective tax rate for 2017.\nInterest expense during 2017 increased by $10.8 million compared to 2016, primarily attributable to the senior note offering of \u20ac350 million in April 2017 and higher interest rates on our senior unsecured debt.\nasbestos and other legal claims, employee benefit plan obligations, deferred income taxes and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits, are excluded from the above table since they are not contractually fixed as to timing and amount.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOur profit margins vary in relation to the relative mix of many factors, including the type of product, the location in which the product is manufactured, the end market for which the product is designed, and the percentage of total revenue represented by aftermarket sales and services, which tend to often have higher margins than foremarket products and consumables.\nWe believe that we are well positioned to grow our businesses organically over the long term by enhancing our product offerings and expanding our customer base. Our current business mix is expected to be well balanced between long- and short-cycle businesses, sales in emerging markets and developed nations and foremarket and aftermarket products and services. Given this balance, management does not use indices other than general economic trends and business initiatives to predict the overall outlook for the Company. Instead, our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers, including to the extent possible their sales, to gauge relative performance and outlook for the future.\nImpairment of Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAs our air and gas handling customers seek to fully utilize capital spending budgets before the end of the year, historically our shipments have peaked during the fourth quarter. Also, our European operations typically experience a slowdown during the July, August and December vacation seasons. General economic conditions may, however, impact future seasonal variations.\nThe methods, estimates and judgments we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based upon our historical experience, our evaluation of business and macroeconomic trends and information from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from what our management anticipates and different assumptions or estimates about the future could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nIn the evaluation of Goodwill for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting entity is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not for a reporting unit's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the reporting entity's fair value is performed and compared to the carrying value of that entity. In certain instances, we may elect to forgo the qualitative assessment and proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, Goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired. Pursuant to ASU 2017-04, which we elected to adopt during the three months ended December 31, 2017, if the carrying value of the reporting unit's Goodwill is greater than its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value over its fair value.\nRaw Material Costs\nFabrication Technology\nThe following table summarizes selected financial data for our Air and Gas Handling segment:\nWe provide a variety of products and services to our customers. Most of our contracts consist of a single, distinct performance obligation or promise to transfer goods or services to a customer. For contracts that include multiple performance obligations, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation.\nStrategic Acquisitions\nThe $103.3 million increase in Gross profit during 2018 in comparison to 2017 was attributable to an increase of $57.8 million in our Fabrication Technology segment and $45.6 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Acquisitions contributed $87.9 million of gross profit and restructuring initiatives added $19.9 million when compared to 2017. The positive impact of acquisitions and restructuring benefits was partially offset by lower sales volume in the Air and Gas Handling segment. Gross profit margin for 2018 included the effect in our Fabrication Technology segment of higher customer prices for certain products to offset input cost inflation, which commensurately increased both Net sales and Cost of sales and compressed total company Gross profit margin by 80 basis points.\nWe expect strategic acquisitions, such as our pending acquisition of DJO, to contribute to our growth. In the short-term, we\nbracing, reconstructive implants, rehabilitation, pain management and physical therapy. Its products address the continuum of patient care from injury prevention to rehabilitation after surgery, injury or from degenerative disease, enabling people to regain or maintain their natural motion. DJO currently develops, manufactures and distributes its products through the following two markets: Prevention & Rehabilitation and Reconstructive.\nA significant portion of our Net sales, approximately 76% for 2018, is derived from operations outside the U.S., with the majority of those sales denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because much of our manufacturing and employee costs are outside the U.S., a significant portion of our costs are also denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in foreign exchange rates can impact our results of operations and are quantified when significant to our discussion. Changes in\n \u2022 During 2018, 2017 and 2016, cash payments of $51.4 million, $30.7 million and $66.6 million, respectively, were made related to our restructuring initiatives. \nCash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period due to changes in working capital and the timing of payments for items such as pension funding, asbestos-related costs and restructuring program funding. Changes in significant operating cash flow items are discussed below.\nDuring 2017, we recorded impairment charges totaling $152.7 million. These charges consisted of a goodwill impairment of $150.2 million and an indefinite-lived trademark impairment charge of $2.5 million. Both charges related to our Air and Gas Handling segment. Additionally, we incurred a $46.9 million non-cash pension settlement loss in connection with a third-party buyout of one of our pension plans.\nOn February 5, 2019, CFX Escrow Corporation issued two tranches of senior notes with aggregate principal amounts of $600 million (the 2024 Notes\u201d) and $400 million (the 2026 Notes\u201d). Upon closing of the DJO acquisition, we will assume all of CFX Escrow Corporation's obligations under the 2024 Notes and 2026 Notes. See Note 12, Debt\u201d for further information.\nOn April 19, 2017, we issued senior unsecured notes with an aggregate principal amount of \u20ac350 million (the Euro Notes\u201d). The Euro Notes are due on April 15, 2025 and have an interest rate of 3.25%. The proceeds from the Euro Notes offering were used to repay borrowings under our DB Credit Agreement and bilateral credit facilities totaling \u20ac283.5 million, as well as for general corporate purposes, and are guaranteed by certain of our domestic subsidiaries.\nOur products and services are available worldwide. The manner in which our products and services are sold differs by region. During 2018, approximately 77% of our sales were shipped to locations outside of the U.S. Accordingly, we are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic and political factors in countries throughout the world. Our ability to grow and our financial performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities that are a consequence of our global operations, including efficiently utilizing our global sales, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, participating in the expansion of market opportunities in emerging markets, successfully completing global strategic acquisitions and engineering innovative new product applications for end users in a variety of geographic markets. However, we believe that our geographic, end market, customer and product diversification may limit the impact that any one country or economy could have on our consolidated results.\nWe face a number of challenges and opportunities, including the successful integration of new acquisitions, application and expansion of our CBS tools to improve margins and working capital management, and rationalization of assets and costs.\n \u2022 Changes in net working capital also affected the operating cash flows for the periods presented. We define working capital as Trade receivables, net and Inventories, net reduced by Accounts payable and Customer advances and billings in excess of costs incurred. During 2018, net working capital consumed cash of $31.0 million, before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventories driven by revenue growth. The net increase was offset by an increase in both payables and customer advances and billings in excess of costs. During 2017, net working capital consumed cash of $92.5 million, before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to an increase in receivables and inventories driven by revenue growth and timing of collections and shipments. During 2016, net working capital consumed cash of $31.4 million, before the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to an increase in receivables and lower billings \nColfax conducts its operations through two operating segments: Air and Gas Handling and Fabrication Technology.\nin excess of costs incurred associated with our Air and Gas business segment. The net increase was offset by an increase in payables in our Air and Gas Handling segment and Fabrication Technology segment and partially offset by decline in inventory levels in our Fabrication Technology segment.\nIn 2016, we experienced a concurrent decline in numerous end-markets and geographic markets that negatively impacted both of our reporting units. We elected not to perform qualitative assessments of Goodwill and instead, proceeded directly to performing the first step of quantitative Goodwill impairment test for its 2016 annual impairment test. The quantitative impairment assessment of Goodwill for each of the Fabrication Technology and Air and Gas Handling reporting units, based on the methodologies identified above, resulted in calculated fair values that exceeded the carrying values for both reporting units. As such, no impairment charges were recorded as a result of the annual Goodwill impairment analysis performed as of October 1, 2016.\nDuring 2018, we completed two acquisitions in the Fabrication Technology segment for net cash consideration of $245.1 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. This includes the acquisition of Gas Control Equipment (GCE) in the fourth quarter for cash consideration of $207.0 million. This acquisition expanded our technology and service offering for specialty gas applications.\nTotal Company\nThe initial credit extensions under the New Credit Facility will only be made available to us, subject to certain conditions precedent, on the date of consummation of the DJO acquisition. The proceeds of such initial credit extensions shall be used on such date (i) to replace the commitments, and repay in full amounts outstanding, under the DB Credit Agreement, (ii) to pay a portion of the consideration in connection with the DJO acquisition, and (iii) for fees and expenses related to the foregoing. Following the consummation of the DJO acquisition, credit extensions under the New Revolver will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe following table summarizes our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2018.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $245.0 million of Cash and cash equivalents, a decrease of $17.0 million from $262.0 million as of December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes the change in Cash and cash equivalents during the periods indicated:\nASC 740 requires changes in tax rates and tax laws to be accounted for in the period of enactment in continuing operations. Accordingly, of significance, we included a provisional estimate of approximately $52 million for the Transition Tax, payable over 8 years for our year ended December 31, 2017. Pursuant to SAB 118, we reduced our provisional amount for Transition Tax by $10.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Generally, the foreign earnings subject to the Transition Tax can be distributed without additional U.S. tax; however, if distributed, the amount could be subject to foreign taxes and U.S. state and local taxes. We continue to maintain its indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nRevenue Recognition\nPlease see Part I, Item 1. Business\u201d for a discussion of Colfax's objectives and methodologies for delivering shareholder value.\n2022 Tangible Equity Units\nforeign exchange rates had an immaterial impact on Net sales and Income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Changes in foreign exchange rates since December 31, 2017 decreased net assets by approximately 7%.\nCash flows provided by investing activities during 2018 included $18.4 million of cash and $139.5 million in proceeds from the sale of CIRCOR common stock related to the 2017 sale of our Fluid Handling business. Cash flows used in investing activities during the 2018 were mainly associated with two acquisition in our Fabrication Technology segment and two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment totaling net cash outflows of $290.9 million. Cash flows provided by investing activities during 2017 included net proceeds of $490.3 million from the sale of the Fluid Handling business and net cash outflows of $346.8 million associated with two acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment and three acquisitions in our Fabrication Technology segment.\nIn November 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire DJO for $3.2 billion in cash. We are financing this acquisition, in part, by (1) entering into the New Credit Facility (as described below in this section); (2) an offering for $460 million of tangible equity units; and (3) an offering for $1 billion of senior unsecured notes (the 2024 Notes\u201d and 2026 Notes\u201d). See Note 12, Debt\u201d and Note 20 Subsequent Events\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nDemand for our products depends in part on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance by our customers. The level of capital expenditures depends, in turn, on general economic conditions as well as access to capital at reasonable cost. Additionally, volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. While demand can be cyclical, we believe that our diversified operations generally limit the impact of a downturn in any one market on our consolidated results. Since the second half of 2017, declines in activity in the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets impacted our Air and Gas Handling segment. These declines reduced the levels of capital invested and maintenance expenditures made by certain of our customers, which in turn has reduced the demand for our products and services. During 2018, our Air and Gas Handling segment has strategically focused on initiatives to grow general industrial end markets, which has helped offset the impacts from the oil, gas, and petrochemical and power generation end markets.\nBusiness Segments\nOn December 17, 2018, we entered into a credit agreement (the New Credit Facility\u201d) by and among the Company, as the borrower, certain of our U.S. subsidiaries identified therein, as guarantors, each of the lenders party thereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, as syndication agent, and the co-documentation agents named therein. The New Credit Facility consists of a revolving credit facility which totals $1.3 billion in commitments (the New Revolver\u201d) and a Term A-1 loan in an aggregate amount of $1.2 billion (the Five Year Term Loan\u201d), each of which matures in five years, and a Term A-2 loan in an aggregate amount of $500 million, which matures in two years (the Two Year Term Loan\u201d and, together with the Five Year Term Loan, the New Term Loan Facilities\u201d). The New Revolver contains a $50 million swing line loan sub-facility.\nWe are also party to letter of credit facilities with an aggregate capacity of $757.4 million. Total letters of credit of $344.1 million were outstanding as of December 31, 2018.\nOn October 11, 2015, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our Common stock from time-to-time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, which were to be retired upon repurchase. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 1,000,000 shares of our Common stock in open market transactions for $20.8 million. The repurchase program expired as of December 31, 2016. See Note 13, Equity\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe 13.2% Net sales increase during 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of an increase in existing businesses of $171.5 million with continued growth in most markets and acquisition-related growth of $119.6 million. Changes in foreign exchange rates had a negative impact of $35.3 million on Net sales. The growth rate from existing businesses included 4.8% from increased customer prices to address higher material and inflation costs, and 4.1% from higher volumes. The increase in Gross profit during 2018 is driven by the acquisition-related growth of $43.2 million and increased sales volumes. Gross margin decreased 140 basis points due to the dilutive effect of input cost inflation being addressed by higher customer prices for certain products. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $32.2 million in 2018 as compared to 2017, primarily driven by an $33.2 million acquisition-related increase and higher costs to support growth initiatives, offset by a $10.9 million net benefit from facility sales in the fourth quarter. Restructuring and other related items increased in 2018 in comparison to 2017, as a result of expanded cost reduction programs.\nDuring 2017, we completed three acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $128.3 million. These acquisitions broadened our product offering and technology content.\nContractual Obligations\nA majority of the revenue we recognize relates to contracts with customers for standard or off-the-shelf products. As control typically transfers to the customer upon shipment of the product in these circumstances, revenue is generally recognized at that point in time. For service contracts, we recognize revenue ratably over the period of performance as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the services provided.\nOverview\nSee Note 17, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our asbestos liabilities and insurance assets.\nOutlook\n \u2022 Fabrication Technology - a global supplier of consumable products and equipment for use in the cutting, joining and automated welding of steels, aluminum and other metals and metal alloys \nEconomic Conditions\nDB Credit Agreement\nThe proceeds of the loans under the DB Credit Agreement were used by us to repay in full balances under our preexisting credit agreement, as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes. The DB Credit Agreement consists of a term loan in the aggregate amount of $750.0 million (the Term Loan\u201d) and a revolving credit facility (the Revolver\u201d) with a commitment capacity of $1.3 billion, each of which had an initial maturity term of five years. The Revolver contains a $50.0 million swing line loan sub-facility. See Note 12, Debt\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nWe assessed the subsidiaries' existing insurance arrangements and agreements, estimated the applicability of insurance coverage for existing and expected future claims, analyzed publicly available information bearing on the current creditworthiness and solvency of the various insurers, and employed such insurance allocation methodologies as we believed appropriate to ascertain the probable insurance recoveries for asbestos liabilities. The analysis took into account self-insurance retentions, policy exclusions, pending litigation, liability caps and gaps in coverage, existing and potential insolvencies of insurers as well as how legal and defense costs will be covered under the insurance policies.\nThe decrease in Net sales from existing businesses during 2017 compared to 2016 was attributable to decreases of $74.7 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment, mostly offset by an increase of $59.0 million in our Fabrication Technology segment. Air and Gas Handling orders, net of cancellations and excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects, decreased $44.1 million during 2017 in comparison to 2016 due to large project bookings during the second half of 2016 that did not repeat, delays in orders in the second half of 2017, and lower demand in power generation markets. The decline was partially offset by increases in general industrial and other end markets.\nAir and Gas Handling\nCertain amounts not allocated to the two reportable segments and intersegment eliminations are reported under the heading Corporate and other.\u201d\n (2) Excludes open purchase orders for goods or services that are provided on demand, the timing of which is not certain. \nPension obligations and other post-retirement benefits are actuarially determined and are affected by several assumptions, including the discount rate, assumed annual rates of return on plan assets, and per capita cost of covered health care benefits. Changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amounts of pension expense and other post-retirement expense recognized in future periods. These assumptions may also have an effect on the amount and timing of future cash contributions. See Note 15, Defined Benefit Plans\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\n\nNew Term Loan Facilities and New Revolving Credit Facility\nThe Loss on short term investments of $10.1 million during 2018 was due to the change in fair value and subsequent sale of the CIRCOR Shares received in connection with the Fluid Handling business sale.\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies\nWe believe the following accounting policies are the most critical in that they are important to the financial statements and they require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of the financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K.\n2024 Notes and 2026 Notes\nWe sold our Fluid Handling business to CIRCOR International ( CIRCOR\u201d), Inc., a Delaware corporation on December 11, 2017. Pursuant to a definitive purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement) signed on September 24, 2017, we retained the asbestos-related contingencies and insurance coverages. However, as we did not retain an interest in the ongoing operations of the business subject to the contingencies, we have classified asbestos-related activity in our Consolidated Statements of Operations as part of Income (loss) from discontinuing operations, net of taxes. See Note 4, Discontinued Operations\u201d for further information.\nGenerally, we measure fair value of reporting units based on a present value of future discounted cash flows and a market valuation approach. The discounted cash flow models indicate the fair value of the reporting units based on the present value of the cash flows that the reporting units are expected to generate in the future. Significant estimates in the discounted cash flow models include: the weighted average cost of capital; long-term rate of growth and profitability of our business; and working capital effects. The market valuation approach indicates the fair value of the business based on a comparison against certain market information. Significant estimates in the market approach model include identifying appropriate market multiples and assessing earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization.\nThe increase in Net sales from existing businesses during 2018 compared to 2017 was attributable to sales from both acquisitions and existing businesses. Net sales from acquisitions in our Air and Gas Handling segment and Fabrication Technology segment were $141.2 million and $119.6 million, respectively. Net sales from existing businesses increased $171.5 million in our Fabrication Technology segment and decreased $44.0 million in our Air and Gas Handling segment. Fluctuation of foreign currency translation rates had a negative impact on Net sales of $21.7 million during the year. Air and Gas Handling orders increased by $129.9 million during 2018 in comparison to 2017; orders excluding acquisitions and foreign currency translation effects decreased $30.3 million. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in the power generation end market, and a $20 million cancellation during the second quarter of 2018 due to newly-implemented restrictions implemented by the U.S. government.\nIn the evaluation of indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If we determine that it is not more likely than not for the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value to be less than its carrying value, a calculation of the fair value is not performed. If we determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value is less than its carrying value, a calculation is performed and compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We measure the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using the relief from royalty\u201d method. Significant estimates in this approach include projected revenues and royalty and discount rates for each trade name evaluated.", "item_7_tables": "Table 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>
